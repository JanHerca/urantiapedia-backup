Interestingly, the ancient Greeks planted the germ of a concept that grew and flowered as  the concept of "possibilities." It was summarized by Plato as being "ideas" that exist in themselves from which all else derives.

The idea of a "Supreme Being" at the head of a world of persons was added by philosopher, R.P. Bowne in the late 19th century.

Then, as indicated in a previous article on "Holism," Alfred N. Whitehead, amalgamated Plato's "ideas" with the concept of a dipolar God having a "primordial" and a "consequent" nature.

Basically, Whitehead almost got it right. However his ideas of God were not developed and remain as a confused concept of a single God, existent both "in" and "outside" the world.

Former Foundation trustee and university lecturer in philosophy, the late Jim Mills, tried unavailingly to interest Urantia Book readers in Whitehead's process philosophy. Jim saw this as being a possible means of introducing the Papers to the academic world. However, Jim's efforts were thwarted, possibly because of the now firmly entrenched connotation of infallibility that has developed about that word "revelation."

In actuality, the Urantia Papers define themselves as "auto-revelation," a term they use to specify a revelatory pathway to mankind via the God-spirit within. (1109)

Therefore, by virtue of the pathway through which the Papers came to us including a Thought Adjuster and a human being (1208), the Papers also class themselves as of "relative purity and partial divinity." (1768) And since a human being was involved, and since nothing touched by human nature can be regarded as infallible (1768),  that leaves Jesus' personal revelation as the only divine and infallible revelation ever given to mankind--and even of that we have no "infallible" record.It follows that since we have no infallible knowledge about God or about our real origins and destinies, faith as well as rationality must play a large role in our decision making. Fortunately we have help available in the form of our Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth.

"_My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me_." (1917)
