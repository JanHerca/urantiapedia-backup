<p>Proof’n Spoof</p>
<p>The previous article refers to the work of Gödel and other logicians who finally demonstrated the folly of mankind in believing that, through rational thought, everything could be known.</p>
<p>However, the proofs of the logician are about as comprehensible as Chinese to a deaf and blind parrot. So let’s try another way of comprehending the incomprehensible.</p>
<p>“This sentence cannot be proved.”</p>
<p>To properly understand that sentence, we have to know the grammatical rules of the English language plus the precise meaning of each of its words. Given a year or two, and many reams of paper, an apprentice logician might come up with an inconsistency—a proof that effectively says that he/she has proved what cannot be proved.</p>
<p>If the sentence had been written in all the languages of mankind, we would have needed a grammar and dictionary for each. So what we really need is a “meta-language,” one that can state precisely what is required and how the requirements transform into each human language. Defining the meaning of language (or mathematics) from within itself spells trouble.</p>
<p>A speck or two of thought may now help us realize that the rules for precise proofs of precise statements need to be formulated in a language different from and superior to the original language of formulation—a meta-language, a language above language. The “lower” can only be precisely defined and understood by that which is “higher.”</p>
<p>Carrying the basic concept into another area, we should be able to comprehend that a creature cannot successfully define the nature of its creator.</p>
<p>Mankind cannot define what God can “be” or “do.” Nor can man define what, how, or how much revelators can reveal. Things would be simpler if we recognized our limitations.</p>
