It appears that each came into being as a result of some strange spiritual-psychological interaction between pairs of the extraordinary children of Adamson and Ratta, who “were often invisible.” Read in context, the “invisible” clause can be taken in two ways, one being that each individual was sometimes visible, sometimes invisible. Or it can be taken to mean that some of these extraordinary children were visible, while others were invisible. The book states, “Every fourth child born to them was of a unique order. It was often invisible.” (861)

Adamson and Ratta were both superhuman. Adamson was a first generation descendant of Adam and Eve. When other descendants were permitted to evacuate this planet, among them were Adamson's first wife and their thirty two children. But Adamson wanted to stay with his parents in order to assist in the building up of the second garden. After helping with the construction of adequate defenses for this new home he set out to the north, accompanied by twenty seven others, in quest of the land of the Nodites that he had heard about from the two long term survivors from the Caligastia rebellion, Van and Amadon.

In a little over three years Adamson found the object of his search, and among them, a beautiful and wonderful young woman named Ratta who claimed to be the last pure line descendant of two of the fallen staff of the Prince. On listening to Adamson's story about the default at the Garden of Eden, and being much attracted by this majestic son of Adam and Eve, Ratta had but a single thought—to marry Adamson. She succeeded.

Together Adamson and Ratta had a family of sixty seven children, sixteen being of this unique order that were often invisible. After the arrival of the second “unique” child, since one was male and the second, female, Adamson decided to mate them. The result of the union was the “eventuation” of the secondary midwayers.

It subsequently transpired that each pair of these unique children of Adamson and Ratta were capable of producing a secondary midwayer every seventy days. Like the primary midwayers, the newly arriving secondary midwayers were “eventuated” fully developed, subsequently experiencing no period of growth or development from immaturity—though they never cease to grow in wisdom and experience. (864) The secondary midwayers have some degree of maleness or femaleness about them, often work in pairs, but are incapable of procreation. They have no need for sleep or earthly material food. They are somehow energized from “space emanations” that are a mystery to we humans.

For want of a better word I've incorrectly used the word “eventuated,” the same word as is used to describe the origin of the Absoniters. “Absoniters are not created; they are eventuated—they simply are.” (2) It appears to be unlikely that a secondary midwayer could have been conceived and carried in the womb of its mother or could experience some kind of physical birth. The process by which they came into being is described as a combined technique of sex and non-sex liaison. In some ways it is reminiscent of the description of a process by which two finaliters bring a new being into existence—a trinitized son. But that is a one-off event, whereas each pair of Adamson and Ratta's unique sixteen children managed to eventuate 248 midwayers before the ability to do so expired.

Of interest because of its uniqueness, is the birth of the sixteen invisible children to Adamson and Ratta. Primary midwayers were visible to the Prince's planetary staff. (744) Adam and Eve could see the midwayers and so could their children, though this ability declined with subsequent generations. (851) One possibility is that the unique sixteen were conceived normally, nurtured in the womb normally, and were born and grew normally. They may have been quite visible to one or both of their parents but were sometimes visible and sometimes invisible to ordinary mortals. Alternatively, they may never have been visible to ordinary mortals and, because of the diminished ability of their parents to see midwayer-like beings, were only sometimes visible but often invisible to them. This may have been more of a problem for Ratta who was many more generations removed from her original superhuman ancestry than Adamson. Whatever the truth, from our point of view, they were a strange group.
