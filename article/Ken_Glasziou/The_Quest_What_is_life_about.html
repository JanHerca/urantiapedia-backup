<p>The Quest</p>
<p>Sooner or later all universe personalities begin to realize that the final quest of eternity is the endless exploration of infinity, the never-ending voyage of discovery into the absoluteness of the First Source and Center.
Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification.
We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself.
Mortals will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness.
In this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity.
These qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely.
To live divinely means actually to live the will of God.
Qualities of divinity are: Unity, truth, beauty, greatness, goodness.</p>
