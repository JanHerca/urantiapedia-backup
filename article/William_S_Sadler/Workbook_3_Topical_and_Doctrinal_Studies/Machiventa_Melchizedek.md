3. The Salem cult had three simple beliefs:
	1. I believe in El Elyon, the Universal Father and Creator.
	2. I accept the Melchizedek covenant—the favor of God by faith, not by sacrifices.
	3. I promise to obey the seven commandments. [UB 93:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p4_1)
4. The seven commandments were:
	1. You shall not serve any God but the Most High Creator of heaven and earth.
	2. You shall not doubt that faith is the only requirement for eternal salvation.
	3. You shall not bear false witness.
	4. You shall not kill.
	5. You shall not steal.

3. Melchizedek made a formal covenant with Abraham. [UB 93:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_3)

5. Abraham became civil and military leader of the Salem colony. [UB 93:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_8)
