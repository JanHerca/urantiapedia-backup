## THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH IN _THE URANTIA BOOK_

### I. THE PROMISED HELPER

1. Jesus promises to send the new helper.
	> “Jesus continued to teach, saying: ‘When I have gone to the Father, and after he has fully accepted the work I have done for you on earth, and after I have received the final sovereignty of my own domain, I shall say to my Father: Having left my children alone on earth, it is in accordance with my promise to send them another teacher. And when the Father shall approve, I will pour out the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh. Already is my Father’s spirit in your hearts, and when this day shall come, you will also have me with you even as you now have the Father. This new gift is the spirit of living truth. The unbelievers will not at first listen to the teachings of this spirit, but the sons of light will all receive him gladly and with a whole heart. And you shall know this spirit when he comes even as you have known me, and you will receive this gift in your hearts, and he will abide with you. You thus perceive that I am not going to leave you without help and guidance. I will not leave you desolate. Today I can be with you only in person. In the times to come I will be with you and all other men who desire my presence, wherever you may be, and with each of you at the same time. Do you not discern that it is better for me to go away; that I leave you in the flesh so that I may the better and the more fully be with you in the spirit?’” [UB 180:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_1) [Acts 2:17](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v17).
2. The new helper leads us into all truth.
	> “‘In just a few hours the world will see me no more; but you will continue to know me in your hearts even until I send you this new teacher, the Spirit of Truth. As I have lived with you in person, then shall I live in you; I shall be one with your personal experience in the spirit kingdom. And when this has come to pass, you shall surely know that I am in the Father, and that, while your life is hid with the Father in me, I am also in you. I have loved the Father and have kept his word; you have loved me, and you will keep my word. As my Father has given me of his spirit, so will I give you of my spirit. And this Spirit of Truth which I will bestow upon you shall guide and comfort you and shall eventually lead you into all truth.’” [UB 180:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_2) [John 16:13](/en/Bible/John/16#v13).
3. Helps us to remember what Jesus taught.
	> “‘I am telling you these things while I am still with you that you may be the better prepared to endure those trials which are even now right upon us. And when this new day comes, you will be indwelt by the Son as well as by the Father. And these gifts of heaven will ever work the one with the other even as the Father and I have wrought on earth and before your very eyes as one person, the Son of Man. And this spirit friend will bring to your remembrance everything I have taught you.’” [UB 180:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_3)
4. The new helper is the “Spirit of Truth.”
	> “The new helper which Jesus promised to send into the hearts of believers, to pour out upon all flesh, is the _Spirit of Truth_. This divine endowment is not the letter or law of truth, neither is it to function as the form or expression of truth. The new teacher is the _conviction of truth_, the consciousness and assurance of true meanings on real spirit levels. And this new teacher is the spirit of living and growing truth, expanding, unfolding, and adaptative truth.” [UB 180:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_1)
5. The new helper vitalizes the golden rule.
	> “The golden rule, when divested of the superhuman insight of the Spirit of Truth, becomes nothing more than a rule of high ethical conduct. The golden rule, when literally interpreted, may become the instrument of great offense to one’s fellows. Without a spiritual discernment of the golden rule of wisdom you might reason that, since you are desirous that all men speak the full and frank truth of their minds to you, you should therefore fully and frankly speak the full thought of your mind to your fellow beings. Such and unspiritual interpretation of the golden rule might result in untold unhappiness and no end of sorrow.” [UB 180:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_5)

### II. WORK OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH

1. Work of the Spirit of Truth.
	> “‘Now that I am leaving you, seeing that the hour has come when I am about to go to the Father, I am surprised that none of you have asked me, Why do you leave us? Nevertheless, I know that you ask such questions in your hearts. I will speak to you plainly, as one friend to another. It is really profitable for you that I go away. If I go not away, the new teacher cannot come into your hearts. I must be divested of this mortal body and be restored to my place on high before I can send this spirit teacher to live in your souls and lead your spirits into the truth. And when my spirit comes to indwell you, he will illuminate the difference between sin and righteous-ness and will enable you to judge wisely in your hearts concerning them.’” [UB 180:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p6_2)
2. Makes a reality of our sonship.
	> “‘While you cannot observe the divine spirit at work in your minds, there is a practical method of discovering the degree to which you have yielded the control of your soul powers to the teaching and guidance of this indwelling spirit of the heavenly Father, and that is the degree of your love for your fellow men. This spirit of the Father partakes of the love of the Father, and as it dominates man, it unfailingly leads in the directions of divine worship and loving regard for one’s fellows. At first you believe that you are sons of God because my teaching has made you more conscious of the inner leadings of our Father’s indwelling presence; but presently the Spirit of Truth shall be poured out upon all flesh, and it will live among men and teach all men, even as I now live among you and speak to you the words of truth. And this Spirit of Truth, speaking for the spiritual endowments of your souls, will help you to know that you are the sons of God. It will unfailingly bear witness with the Father’s indwelling presence, your spirit, then dwelling in all men as it now dwells in some, telling you that you are in reality the sons of God.’” [UB 146:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_6)
3. Draws truth seekers toward the Creator Son.
	> “The Creator Sons are endowed with a spirit of universe presence in many ways analogous to that of the Seven Master Spirits of Paradise. This is the Spirit of Truth which is poured out upon a world by a bestowal Son after he receives spiritual title to such a sphere. This bestowed Comforter is the spiritual force which ever draws all truth seekers towards Him who is the personification of truth in the local universe. This spirit is an inherent endowment of the Creator Son, emerging from his divine nature just as the master circuits of the grand universe are derived from the personality presences of the Paradise Deities.” [UB 34:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_5)
4. Mother Spirit universe focus of Spirit of Truth.
	> “The Creator Son may come and go; his personal presence may be in the local universe or elsewhere; yet the Spirit of Truth functions undisturbed, for this divine presence, while derived from the personality of the Creator Son, is functionally centered in the person of the Divine Minister.
	> 
	> “The Universe Mother Spirit, however, never leaves the local universe headquarters world. The spirit of the Creator Son may and does function independently of the personal presence of the Son, but not so with her personal spirit. The Holy Spirit of the Divine Minister would become nonfunctional if her personal presence should be removed from Salvington. Her spirit presence seems to be fixed on the universe headquarters world, and it is this very fact that enables the spirit of the Creator Son to function independently of the whereabouts of the Son. The Universe Mother Spirit acts as the universe focus and center of the Spirit of Truth as well as of her own personal influence, the Holy Spirit.” [UB 34:4.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_6)

### III. FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH

1. Functions of the Spirit of Truth.
	> “Though the Spirit of Truth is poured out upon all flesh, this spirit of the Son is almost wholly limited in function and power by man’s personal reception of that which constitutes the sum and substance of the mission of the bestowal Son. The Holy Spirit is partly independent of human attitude and partially conditioned by the decisions and co-operation of the will of man. Nevertheless, the ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in the sanctification and spiritualization of the inner life of those mortals who the more fully _obey_ the divine leadings.” [UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)
2. Transformation by the Spirit of Truth.
	> “‘By the old way you seek to suppress, obey, and conform to the rules of living; by the new way you are first _transformed_ by the Spirit of Truth and thereby strengthened in your inner soul by the constant spiritual renewing of your mind, and so are you endowed with the power of the certain and joyous performance of the gracious, acceptable, and perfect will of God. Forget not—it is your personal faith in the exceedingly great and precious promises of God that ensures your becoming partakers of the divine nature. Thus by your faith and the spirit’s transformation, you become in reality the temples of God, and his spirit actually dwells within you. If, then, the spirit dwells within you, you are no longer bondslaves of the flesh but free and liberated sons of the spirit. The new law of the spirit endows you with the liberty of self-mastery in place of the old law of the fear of self-bondage and the slavery of self-denial.’” [UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4)
3. Sure guidance of the Spirit of Truth.
	> “Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, ‘This is the way.’” [UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)

### IV. SPECIAL MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH

1. Spirit of Truth detects “spiritual flavor.”
	> “Intellectual self-consciousness can discover the beauty of truth, its spiritual quality, not only by the philosophic consistency of its concepts, but more certainly and surely by the unerring recognition of truth because Spirit of Truth. Happiness ensues from the recognition of truth because it can be _acted out_; it can be lived. Disappointment and sorrow attend upon error because, not being a reality, it cannot be realized in experience. Divine truth is best known by its _spiritual flavor_.” [UB 2:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_6)
2. Compensates human handicaps.
	> “In all our efforts to enlarge and spiritualize the human concept of God, we are tremendously handicapped by the limited capacity of the mortal mind. We are also seriously handicapped in the execution of our assignment by the limitations of language and by the poverty of material which can be utilized for purposes of illustration or comparison in our efforts to portray divine values and to present spiritual meanings to the finite, mortal mind of man. All our efforts to enlarge the human concept of God would be well-nigh futile except for the fact that the mortal mind is indwelt by the bestowed Adjuster of the Universal Father and is pervaded by the Truth Spirit of the Creator Son. Depending, therefore, on the presence of these divine spirits within the heart of man for assistance in the enlargement of the concept of God, I cheerfully undertake the execution of my mandate to attempt the further portrayal of the nature of God to the mind of man.” [UB 2:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p0_3)
3. Fraternizes with the Adjusters.
	> “This supper of remembrance, when it is partaken of by those who are Son-believing and God-knowing, does not need to have associated with its sym- bolism any of man’s puerile misinterpretations regarding the meaning of the divine presence, for upon all such occasions the Master is _really present_. The remembrance supper is the believer’s symbolic rendezvous with Michael. When you become thus spirit-conscious, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fraternizes with the indwelling fragment of his Father.” [UB 179:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6)

### V. BESTOWAL OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH

1. According to Jesus’ promise the Spirit comes.
	> “About one o’clock, as the one hundred and twenty believers were engaged in prayer, they all became aware of a strange presence in the room. At the same time these disciples all became conscious of a new and profound sense of spiritual joy, security, and confidence. This new consciousness of spiritual strength was immediately followed by a strong urge to go out and publicly proclaim the gospel of the kingdom and the good news that Jesus had risen from the dead.
	> 
	> “Peter stood up and declared that this must be the coming of the Spirit of Truth which the Master had promised them and proposed that they go to the temple and begin the proclamation of the good news committed to their hands. And they did just what Peter suggested.” [UB 194:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_1) [Acts 2](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2.htm).
2. Religion of Jesus becomes a religion about Jesus.
	> “These men had been trained and instructed that the gospel which they should preach was the fatherhood of God and the sonship of man, but at just this moment of spiritual ecstasy and personal triumph, the best tidings, the greatest news, these men could think of was the _fact_ of the risen Master. And so they went forth, endowed with power from on high, preaching glad tidings to the people—even salvation through Jesus—but they unintentionally stumbled into the error of substituting some of the facts associated with the gospel for the gospel message itself. Peter unwittingly led off in this mistake, and others followed after him on down to Paul, who created a new religion out of the new version of the good news.
	> 
	> “The gospel of the kindgom is: the fact of the fatherhood of God, coupled with the resultant truth of the sonship-brotherhood of men. Christianity, as it developed from that day, is: the fact of God as the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, in association with the experience of believer-fellowship with the risen and glorified Christ.” [UB 194:0.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_3)
3. Believers are enthralled by the new gospel.
	> “It is not strange that these spirit-infused men should have seized upon this opportunity to express their feelings of triumph over the forces which had sought to destroy their Master and end the influence of his teachings. At such a time as this it was easier to remember their personal association with Jesus and to be thrilled with the assurance that the Master still lived, that their friendship had not ended, and that the spirit had indeed come upon them even as he had promised.
	> 
	> “These believers felt themselves suddenly translated into another world, a new existence of joy, power, and glory. The Master had told them the kingdom would come with power, and some of them thought they were beginning to discern what he meant.
	> 
	> “And when all of this is taken into consideration, it is not difficult to understand how these men came to preach a _new gospel about Jesus_ in the place of their former message of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men.” [UB 194:0.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_5)

### VI. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH

1. New spirit solvent for human difficulties.
	> “Jesus lived on earth and taught a gospel which redeemed man from the superstition that he was a child of the devil and elevated him to the dignity of a faith son of God. Jesus’ message, as he preached it and lived it in his day, was an effective solvent for man’s spiritual difficulties in that day of its statement. And now that he has personally left the world, he sends in his place his Spirit of Truth, who is designed to live in man and, for each new generation, to restate the Jesus message so that every new group of mortals to appear upon the face of the earth shall have a new and up-to-date version of the gospel, just such personal enlightenment and group guidance as will prove to be an effective solvent for man’s ever-new and varied spiritual difficulties.” [UB 194:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1)
2. You are not conscious of the spirit.
	> “Do not make the mistake of expecting to become strongly intellectually conscious of the outpoured Spirit of Truth. The spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Michael, the Son. From the beginning Jesus taught that the spirit would not speak of himself. The proof, therefore, of your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth is not to be found in your consciousness of this spirit but rather in your experience of enhanced fellowship with Michael.”
	> 
	> “The spirit also came to help men recall and understand the words of the Master as well as to illuminate and reinterpret his life on earth.
	> 
	> “Next, the Spirit of Truth came to help the believer to witness to the realities of Jesus’ teachings and his life as he lived it in the flesh, and as he now again lives it anew and afresh in the individual believer of each passing generation of the spirit-filled sons of God.
	> 
	> “Thus it appears that the Spirit of Truth comes really to lead all believers into all truth, into the expanding knowledge of the experience of the living and growing spiritual consciousness of the reality of eternal and ascending sonship with God.” [UB 194:2.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_5)
3. Baptism of the spirit.
	> “The term ‘baptism of the spirit,’ which came into such general use about this time, merely signified the conscious reception of this gift of the Spirit of Truth and the personal acknowledgment of this new spiritual power as an augmentation of all spiritual influences previously experienced by God-knowing souls.” [UB 194:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_10)
4. The sevenfold spirit influence.
	> “In a way, mankind is subject to the double influence of the sevenfold appeal of the universe spirit influences. The early evolutionary races of mortals are subject to the progressive contact of the seven adjutant mindspirits of the local universe Mother Spirit. As man progresses upward in the scale of intelligence and spiritual perception, there eventually come to hover over him and dwell within him the seven higher spirit influences. And these seven spirits of the advancing worlds are:
	> 
	> “1. The bestowed spirit of the Universal Father—the Thought Adjusters.
	> 
	> “2. The spirit presence of the Eternal Son—the spirit gravity of the universe of universes and the certain channel of all spirit communion.
	> 
	> “3. The spirit presence of the Infinite Spirit—the universal spirit-mind of all creation, the spiritual source of the intellectual kinship of all progressive intelligences.
	> 
	> “4. The spirit of the Universal Father and the Creator Son—the Spirit of Truth, generally regarded as the spirit of the Universe Son.
	> 
	> “5. The spirit of the Infinite Spirit and the Universe Mother Spirit—the Holy Spirit, generally regarded as the spirit of the
	> 
	> “6. The mind-spirit of the Universe Mother Spirit—the seven adjutant mind-spirits of the local universe.
	> 
	> “7. The spirit of the Father, Sons, and Spirits—the new-name spirit of the ascending mortals of the realms after the fusion of the mortal spirit-born soul with the Paradise Thought Adjuster and after the subsequent attainment of the divinity and glorification of the status of the Paradise Corps of the Finality.
	> 
	> “And so did the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth bring to the world and its peoples the last of the spirit endowment designed to aid in the ascending search for God.” [UB 194:2.12-20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_12)

### VII. WHAT HAPPENED AT PENTECOST

1. Jesus lives in truth-taught believers.
	> “Many queer and strange teachings became associated with the early narra- tives of the day of Pentecost. In subsequent times the events of this day, on which the Spirit of Truth, the new teacher, came to dwell with mankind, have become confused with the foolish outbreaks of rampant emo- tionalism. The chief mission of this outpoured spirit of the Father and the Son is to teach men about the truths of the Father’s love and the Son’s mercy. These are the truths of divinity which men can comprehend more fully than all the other divine traits of character. The Spirit of Truth is concerned primarily with the revelation of the Father’s spirit nature and the Son’s moral character. The Creator Son, in the flesh, revealed God to men; the Spirit of Truth, in the heart, reveals the Creator Son to men. When man yields the ‘fruits of the spirit’ in his life, he is simply showing forth the traits which the Master manifested in his own earthly life. When Jesus was on earth, he lived his life as one personal- ity—Jesus of Nazareth. As the indwelling spirit of the ‘new teacher,’ the Master has, since Pentecost, been able to live his life anew in the experience of every truth-taught believer.” [UB 194:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_1)
2. Pentecost broke national and racial fetters.
	> “On the day of Pentecost the religion of Jesus broke all national re- strictions and racial fetters. It is forever true, ‘Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.’ On this day the Spirit of Truth became the personal gift from the Master to every mortal. This spirit was bestowed for the purpose of qualifying believers more effectively to preach the gospel of the kingdom, but they mistook the experience of receiving the outpoured spirit for a part of the new gospel which they were unconsciously formulating.” [UB 194:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_5) [2 Cor 3:17](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/3#v17).
3. The Spirit of Truth was bestowed upon all believers.
	> “Do not overlook the fact that the Spirit of Truth was bestowed upon all sincere believers; this gift of the spirit did not come only to the apostles. The one hundred and twenty men and women assembled in the upper chamber all received the new teacher, as did all the honest of heart throughout the whole world. This new teacher was bestowed upon mankind, and every soul received him in accordance with the love for truth and the capacity to grasp and comprehend spiritual realities. At last, true religion is delivered from the custody of priests and all sacred classes and finds its real manifestation in the individual souls of men.” [UB 194:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_6)
4. Scope of the spirit’s influence.
	> “The religion of Jesus fosters the highest type of human civilization in that it creates the highest type of spiritual personality and proclaims the sacredness of that person.
	> 
	> “The coming of the Spirit of Truth on Pentecost made possible a religion which is neither radical nor conservative; it is neither the old nor the new; it is to be dominated neither by the old nor the young. The fact of Jesus’ earthly life provides a fixed point for the anchor of time, while the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth provides for the everlasting expansion and endless growth of the religion which he lived and the gospel which he proclaimed. The spirit guides into all truth; he is the teacher of an ex- panding and always-growing religion of endless progress and divine unfold- ing. This new teacher will be forever unfolding to the truth-seeking be- liever that which was so divinely folded up in the person and nature of the Son of Man.” [UB 194:3.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_7)
5. Jesus’ religion free from all racial and religious influences.
	> “The manifestations associated with the bestowal of the ‘new teacher,’ and the reception of the apostles’ preaching by the men of various races and nations gathered together at Jerusalem, indicate the universality of the religion of Jesus. The gospel of the kingdom was to be identified with no particular race, culture, or language. This day of Pentecost wit- nessed the great effort of the spirit to liberate the religion of Jesus from its inherited Jewish fetters. Even after this demonstration of pouring out the spirit upon all flesh, the apostles at first endeavored to impose the requirements of Judaism upon their converts. Even Paul had trouble with his Jerusalem brethren because he refused to subject the gen- tiles to these Jewish practices. No revealed religion can spread to all the world when it makes the serious mistake of becoming permeated with some national culture or associated with established racial, social, or economic practices.” [UB 194:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_9)
6. Pentecost was free from all sacred environment.
	> “The bestowal of the Spirit of Truth was independent of all forms, cere- monies, sacred places, and special behavior by those who received the full- ness of its manifestation. When the spirit came upon those assembled in the upper chamber, they were simply sitting there, having just been engaged in silent prayer. The spirit was bestowed in the country as well as in the city. It was not necessary for the apostles to go apart to a lonely place for years of solitary meditation in order to receive the spirit. For all time, Pentecost disassociates the idea of spiritual experience from the notion of especially favorable environments.” [UB 194:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_10)
7. Liberation and magnification of Jesus’ teachings.
	> “Pentecost, with its spiritual endowment, was designed forever to loose the religion of the Master from all dependence upon physical force; the teachers of this new religion are now equipped with spiritual weapons. They are to go out to conquer the world with unfailing forgiveness, match-less good will, and abounding love. They are equipped to overcome evil with good, to vanquish hate by love, to destroy fear with a courageous and living faith in truth. Jesus had already taught his followers that his religion was never passive; always were his disciples to be active and positive in their ministry of mercy and in their manifestations of love. No longer did these believers look upon Yahweh as ‘the Lord of Hosts.’ They now regarded the eternal Deity as the ‘God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.’ They made that progress, at least, even if they did in some measure fail fully to grasp the truth that God is also the spiritual Father of every individual.” [UB 194:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_11) [Col 1:3](/en/Bible/Colossians/1#v3). [Rom 15:6](/en/Bible/Romans/15#v6). [John 14:23](/en/Bible/John/14#v23).
8. The secret of a better civilization.
	> “Pentecost endowed mortal man with the power to forgive personal injuries, to keep sweet in the midst of the gravest injustice, to remain unmoved in the face of appalling danger, and to challenge the evils of hate and anger by the fearless acts of love and forbearance. Urantia has passed through the ravages of great and destructive wars in its history. All partici- pants in these terrible struggles met with defeat. There was but one victor; there was only one who came out of these embittered struggles with an enhanced reputation— that was Jesus of Nazareth and his gospel of overcoming evil with good. The secret of a better civilization is bound up in the Master’s teachings of the brotherhood of man, the good will of love and mutual trust.” [UB 194:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_12)

## THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH IN THE BIBLE

Throughout the New Testament the Spirit of Truth is confused with the Holy Spirit.

> 
> “And Peter said to them: ‘Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” [Acts 2:38](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v38).
