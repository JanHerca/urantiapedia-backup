## I. THE FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER

1. God, as the First Source and Center, is primal in relation to total reality—unqualifiedly; infinite as well as eternal and therefore limited or conditioned only by volition. [UB 0:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_9)
2. The God of the First Source and Center exercises cosmic overcontrol by absolute Paradise gravity. [UB 1:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_10)
3. The Universal Father is the personality of the First Source and Center. [UB 0:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_10)
4. The First Source and Center is that infinity who unqualifiedly transcends all mind. all matter, and all spirit. [UB 1:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_7)
5. Finite actualities are derived from the First Source and Center by means of self-existent free will. [UB 105:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p5_4)

## II. THE I AM

1. The concept of the I AM is a philosophic concession which is made to the time-bound, space-fettered, finite mind of man, to the impossibility of creature comprehension of eternity existences, nonbeginning, nonending realities and relationships. 0:3.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_23)
2. The I AM achieves personality by becoming the Eternal Father of the Original Son and the Eternal Source of Paradise. 0:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_22)
3. Absolute causation resides in the Universal Father functioning as the I AM. [UB 105:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p1_1)
4. The sevenfold nature of the I AM is suggested by the Seven Absolutes of Infinity:
	1. The Universal Father.
	2. The Universal Controller.
	3. The Universal Creator.
	4. The Infinite Upholder.
	5. The Infinite Potential.
	6. The Infinite Capacity.
	7. The Universal One of Infinity. [UB 105:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p2_4)
5. The I AM postulate of the infinite and the absolute transcends all time-past, present and future. [UB 118:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_9)
	**BIBLE REFERENCE**: [Ex 3.4](/en/Bible/Exodus/3#v4).

## III. GOD THE FATHER

### 1. THE DIVINE IDENTITY

1. The Universal Father is the God of all creation. [UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)
2. First think of God as a creator, then as a controller, and lastly as an infinite upholder. [UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)
3. In science God is a cause, in philosophy. a reality; in religion, a loving Father. [UB 4:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_7)
4. God is spirit. [UB 1:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_1)
5. God is a universal spirit—an infinite spirit person. [UB 1:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_5)

2. God is personality. [UB 1:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_7)
3. The concept of the personality of God is the measure of religious maturity. [UB 1:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_10)
4. While God must be more than a personality, he cannot be anything less. [UB 1:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_2)

6. Only a person can love and be loved. [UB 1:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_3)

### 3. THE NATURE OF GOD

1. God is not a synonym for nature, neither is he natural law personified. God is a transcendent reality, not mans traditional concept of supreme values. God is not a psychological focalization of spiritual meanings, neither is he “the noblest work of man.” God may be any or all of these concepts, but he is more. He is a saving and loving Father.

2. God is neither manlike nor machinelike. [UB 1:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_1)
