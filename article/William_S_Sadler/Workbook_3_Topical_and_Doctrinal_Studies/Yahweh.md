## I. DEITY AMONG THE SEMITES

1. The evolution of Hebrew theology embraced five concepts of Deity:
	1. Yahweh.
	2. El Elyon.
	3. El Shaddai.
	4. El.
	5. Elohim. [UB 96:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p1_2)
2. The Hebrews deanthropomorphized God without making him an abstraction of philosophy. [UB 97:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p0_1)
3. The Kenites held many of the concepts of Melchizedek respecting Deity. [UB 96:0.2
4. There was a continuous evolution of Deity concept from the primitive Yahweh to the high level of the Isaiahs. [UB 96:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p4_9)

## II. TIMES OF MOSES

1. Moses taught that Yahweh was a jealous God. He was building a national conscience—he awed the people with the justice of God. [UB 96:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p4_6)
2. The Hebrew belief in Yahweh explains why they tarried so long about Mt. Sinai. [UB 96:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p4_4)
3. Joshua tried to maintain Moses’ teachings. [UB 96:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p6_1)

## III. SAMUEL AND ELIJAH

1. Samuel proclaimed the changelessness of God—a sincere and covenant-keeping God—a God of great mercy. [UB 97:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_4)
2. Elijah continued Samuel’s work, but paid more attention to the land problems of the Baalites. [UB 97:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p2_1)

## IV. AMOS AND HOSEA

1. Amos proclaimed that God would punish his own people because of their sins—justice. [UB 97:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_1)
2. Hosea presented a God of forgiveness—he rejected all sacrifices. [UB 97:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_5)

## V. JEREMIAH

Jeremiah proclaimed the internationalization of Yahweh. [UB 97:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p6_1)

## VI. THE ISAIAHS

1. The first Isaiah taught punishment for both personal and national sins. [UB 97:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p5_1)
2. The second Isaiah proclaimed the universal Creator, the forgiving God, and the heavenly Father. [UB 97:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_1)
