## I. ORIGIN AND NATURE

1. Sometimes the sovereign of Nebadon is referred to as Christ Michael. [UB 21:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p0_3)
2. Our Creator Son is the personification of the 611,121st infinite concept of the Father and the Son. [UB 33:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p1_1)
3. Each Creator Son is the unique, unqualified, and final expression of the infinite concept of his origin. [UB 21:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p1_2)
4. When the concept of absolute ideation in the Eternal Son encounters an absolute personality concept in the Universal Father—there flashes into existence an original Creator Son. [UB 21:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p1_1)
5. Each Creator Son is endowed with spiritual drawing power in his own realm. [UB 20:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_13)
6. A Creator Son is limited by space, but not by time. [UB 34:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p3_5)
7. There are more than seven hundred thousand Creator Sons in existence. [UB 21:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p1_4)

## II. CREATORS OF LOCAL UNIVERSES

1. The Creator Sons are preceded in universe organization by the power directors and other Third Source beings. [UB 32:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_1)
2. From the energies of space, thus previously organized, our Creator Son established the inhabited worlds of Nebadon. [UB 32:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_1)
3. Each Creator Son is accompanied by a Creative Daughter of the Infinite Spirit—the local universe Mother Spirit. [UB 21:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p2_2)
4. The first creative act of the Creator Son and the Creative Mother Spirit produces the chief executive—Gabriel. [UB 32:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_6)
5. The Creator Sons earn their sovereignty by bestowing themselves in the likeness of their own creatures. [UB 120:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_1)
6. The Michaels are the most versatile and powerful of all divine beings in the local universes. [UB 33:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p1_2)
7. The local universe of Nebadon has 3,840,101 inhabited worlds. The local system of Satania has 619. [UB 32:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_9)
8. In accepting vicegerent sovereignty, a Creator Son takes an oath not to assume complete sovereignty until he completes his seven bestowal experiences. [UB 21:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p3_12)

## III. THE MICHAEL BESTOWALS

1. In each bestowal experience the Creator Son adds to his nature that of the creature. [UB 21:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p4_6)
2. Jesus of Nazareth was on his seventh bestowal when he sojourned on Urantia. [UB 21:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p4_5)
3. The Creator Son is truly “the way, the truth, and the life.” [UB 21:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p6_4)
4. The Michael bestowals were:
	1. First—a Melchizedek.
	2. Second—Lanonandek Son.
	3. Third—Material Son.
	4. Fourth—Seraphim.
	5. Fifth—Spirit ascender.
	6. Sixth—Morontia mortal.
	7. Seventh—Urantia mortal. [UB 119:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_7)

## IV. LOCAL UNIVERSE ORGANIZATION

1. To a local universe, to all practical purposes, a Michael Son is God. [UB 5:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_6)
2. The entire judicial mechanism of Nebadon is under the supervision of Gabriel. [UB 33:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_2)
