		- (The Bible lists two Nazareth rejections. The first rejection is told in [Luke 4:16-30](/en/Bible/Luke/4#v16) and follows the Urantia story very closely. The second rejection is told in [Matt. 13:54-58](/en/Bible/Matthew/13#v54) and [Mark 6:1-6](/en/Bible/Mark/6#v1), and is very abbreviated. Luke’s story is correct, but he placed it so early in Jesus’ career as to make it seem like another episode. It really belongs in the third preaching tour.)

## THE APOCRYPHA

### I. THE OLD TESTAMENT APOCRYPHA

#### A. **THE OLD TESTAMENT CANON**

1. It took one thousand years to assemble the 39 books which make up the Old Testament.
2. The Old Testament Canon was established at a meeting of rabbis at Jamnia in A.D. 90.
3. All writings of later date than Ezra and Nehemiah were rejected.
4. Christian usage of Old Testament scriptures constrained the Jews to close the Old Testament Canon.
5. The rejected writings were divided into two classes:
	- a. The Apocrypha.
	- b. The Apocalypse.

#### B. **OLD TESTAMENT APOCRYPHA** (Hidden or spurious)

1. I ESDRAS
	- Decline and fall of Judah from the time of Josiah. Overthrow of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. The return under Ezra—reorganization of the Jewish state. Persian kings rebuild the temple. Ezra’s war on mixed marriages.
2. II ESDRAS
	- The Lord’s anger against Israel—the end of the age. Ezra’s seven visions of judgment and retribution, including the vision of women. Prophecies of war and calamity. Rule of the Messiah for 400 years.
3. TOBIT
	- The blind Tobit, a captive in Nineveh, sends his son Tobias to collect a debt in Media. Tobias marries the seven times widowed virgin, and by fish gall dispatches the demon who had killed her husbands. Collects the debt, returns, and the father’s sight is restored. Tobias left Nineveh before it was destroyed.
4. JUDITH
	- Holophernes, an Assyrian general, acting for Nebuchadnezzar, besieged Bethulia. Judith, a pious Jewish widow, enters his camp, and while he is in a drunken stupor, beheads him, taking his head back to the Jewish camp. The Assyrian army is dispersed.
5. ADDITIONS TO ESTHER
	- Has to do with Esther at the court of Artaxerxes and Mardocheus’ dream. Discussion of Mordecai’s dream. The king’s edict in favor of the Jews.
6. THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON
	- Contrasts the righteous and the ungodly. The rewards of pleasure and salvation. The attainments of wisdom—the gift of God. Heroes of wisdom from Adam to Moses—contrasted with the wicked. Israelites contrasted with Egyptians.
7. ECCLESIASTICUS
	- (Wisdom of Jesus the Son of SIRACH)
	- One of the best of the Old Testament Apocrypha—compares with Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Resignation and humility. How to get wisdom. Kindness and self-control. The wise and the foolish.

First day at school Jesus knows his letters from Alpha to Omega. Teacher asks Joseph to take Jesus away—saying: “I sought a disciple and found a master.”

Jesus curses associates and then heals them. Playing with children on housetop, one falls off and dies. Jesus makes him come alive. Young man cuts foot with axe—Jesus restores foot. Sows grain, and at once reaps one hundred measures.

Fairly orthodox story according to the Gospels with additions concerning the resurrection. Tells story of Jesus going to Hades to deliver the righteous Fathers.

2. **ACTS OF PILATE** (Gospel of Nicodemus)

Twenty-nine sections. Generally, conforms to the story of the four gospels.

Special features: Roman standards bowed before Jesus as he passed. Did the same when strong Jews held them. Did this every time Jesus passed.

Jews charged that Jesus was illegitimate. Many testified for Jesus-man suffering for 38 years and was healed. A blind man cured.

They locked up Joseph of Arimathea. Jesus let him out. Priest of Galilee saw Jesus’ ascension. Another heard him tell about drinking poison and handling snakes. (Mark 16)

Nicodemus and Joseph convert Annas and Caiaphas.

Judas’s wife roasting rooster tries to keep Judas from suicide by having the cock crow.

Mary Magdalene goes to Rome.

Jesus descends into hell. Plants his cross. Releases Adam and Eve and all the ancient worthies. Takes Satan captive. Takes then all to Paradise.

Pilate goes to Annas—he confesses they crucified the Son of God. Pilate writes a confession to Emperor Claudius.

**Appendix**. Wise men saw a cross, saying, “This is the Son of God.” Jesus makes a dead cock alive to follow Judas and report on him. The cock reported—and Jesus sent him off on a thousand year’s flight.

Satan and the Prince of hell have a quarrel about Christ. Satan is expelled. Takes many out of hell, including Adam who then meets Enoch and Elijah.

Pilate summons the Jews and makes them read the Scriptures relating to Christ. They confess they made a mistake in crucifying Jesus. They all repent.

3. **GOSPEL OF BARTHOLOMEW**

Jesus tells Bartholomew that 30,000 souls leave this world each day. Tells him about going down to Hades. Later, Jesus tells him that only 50 of these souls are righteous. But some of these others may later be saved. Jesus another time told him 12,880 persons die each day. Begs Jesus to show him the Devil. Jesus finally does—a dragon-like monster. The Devil tells him how to deceive men. (Gluttony, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, suicide, etc.)

Bartholomew looks into the bottomless pit. Learns about different kinds of punishment for sins. Satan said he had 600 Demon assistants. Discussion about the sin against the Holy Ghost.

Satan said God cast him out of Paradise because he would not worship Adam—made in the image of God.Saturday, Death and Six assistants came up from hell and talked with Jesus—he vanquished them, got up, went down to hell, and smashed things up in general. Bound Satan.

Adam and Eve stationed at the gate of Paradise to welcome arriving saints.

Thomas goes home because his son died. Raised him from the dead in Jesus’ name.

4. **BOOK OF JOHN THE EVANGELIST**

Jesus did not take human nature, but rather angelic nature. The Mosaic laws are works of the Devil.

Fallen angels enter into women and debauch mankind.

A story of Christ’s second coming somewhat after Paul’s teaching.

The pit of Hades is so deep that a stone cast in would take three years to reach the bottom.

5. **ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN**

Evodius; associate of Andrew and Peter and seventy-second disciple, says he saw all of this: Jesus returned with a chariot of cherubim and Mary’s soul leaped to his bosom. Then Mary dies and her body is hidden. It is not corrupted. Jesus returns and takes the body to Paradise. David comes with Jesus. Mary lived in Jerusalem with a group of virgins. There were 206 days from her death to the assumption. The voice of the Trinity welcomed Mary to Paradise. Jesus brought back Mary’s soul to embrace the resurrected body.

High priest’s hand cut off. He confesses guilt of the crucifixion, embraces Mary’s body, and his hand grows back on his arm.

Mary went daily to pray at Jesus’ sepulchre, but no one could see her. Gabriel would visit with her. Many apostles resurrected to salute Mary at the assumption—Peter was their spokesman. Thomas came from India. Every sick person who touched the wall of Mary’s sepulchre was healed. Mary and the apostles are transported by air to Jerusalem-from Bethlehem to escape the priests who wanted to burn Mary’s body when she died. As the apostles carry Mary on her bed, a Jew sits on the bed. His arms are cut off by an angelic sword and dangle in the air over the bed.

When Mary was in danger at Bethlehem John was preaching at Ephesus and was transported by air to Mary’s assistance. Mary’s dead body shone with a dazzling brightness. A bright cloud hovered over the funeral procession. Angels were singing in the cloud.

The man who talked with Peter the night of the denial touches the bier, his hands wither. He confirms belief, and upon kissing the bier, he is healed. He takes a palm from John, goes to Jerusalem, and cures all the blind.

After Mary’s assumption, the apostles are transported by air to their homes.

Thomas was late in arriving—he passed Mary in the air—she tossed him her girdle—he showed it to the apostles.

John’s coat raises a dead man. John finally goes to heaven bodily-the assumption of John.

2. **ACTS OF PAUL**

Tertullian says the author of this book was convicted of imposture and deposed. He was a presbyter in Asia. (About A.D. 160) Paul raises a young man (Barnabas) from the dead. Paul creates a commotion by preaching against marriage.

Thecla, a maiden, hears Paul. Renounces her betrothal. Paul is arrested—banished. Thecla is to be burned. Rain and hail put out the fire—she is saved. Later, she was fed to the beasts—they refused to harm her. She cast herself into a pool—the seals floated on top—dead.

The king gives Thomas much money to build the palace. Thomas gives away the money to the poor. When the king comes, he finds no palace. He is wroth and orders Thomas arrested.

The king’s brother dies, goes to Paradise, and comes back to tell the king of the wonderful palace which Thomas had builded for the king

The king’s brother is returned to this life—Thomas is released from prison. This is a long and wordy recital in the Acts of Thomas.

There is a long story of a dragon who was jealous of a maiden and whom Thomas caused to swell up and burst.

A colt—descendant of the olden Balaam—utters praises for Thomas. Several are raised from the dead and devils are cast out of many. Many sick are healed by washing in a stream which Thomas had blessed.

Thomas finally cast into prison because the wife of the ruler had stopped sex relations with him. He blamed the teachings of Thomas. In this connection—and while in prison—Thomas utters the famous “Psalm of the Soul”—one of the most worthy, from a literary standpoint, of all of this document. Then Thomas is released and goes free. After much preaching and many converts he is again imprisoned and executed.

Later, when the king’s child as afflicted, he sends for one of Thomas’s bones. Fails to find the body, but brings some dust from the tomb, and his child is cured.

#### F. **THE EPISTLES**

2. **LETTER OF LENTULUS**

Contains a detailed description of Jesus’ portrait.

3. **EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS**

Purported to be written by Paul. It is a very mediocre production compared to Paul’s other writings.

4. **CORRESPONDENCE OF PAUL AND SENECA**

Seneca, at Caesar’s court, exchanges some 14 letters with Paul. Nothing noteworthy is found in these communications.

5. **EPISTLE TO THE APOSTLES**

This is the major work of the Epistles. It is a lengthy but commonplace review of many events in Jesus’ life. There is an answer to a question as to when he would be coming back after he returned to his Father. The answer appears to say that he would return after 150 years.

#### G. **APOCALYPSES**

1. **APOCALYPSE OF PETER**

Begins with a discussion of illegitimate children—how they are put in the hands of “caretaker angels.”

Peter asks Jesus to show him someone who had departed this world. He was shown a man whose face shone like the sun. His body was whiter than snow—altogether, he looked like a rainbow.

Then Peter was shown Hell. Men hanging by their tongues. Women hanging by their hair. Others hanging by their feet—all being tortured by fire. Moneylenders for usury were in a lake of molten fire. There was a special pit of fire for homosexuals.

In the resurrection, beasts and fowls were required to restore all that they had eaten—that the very identical particles should become part of the resurrected bodies of the saints. The bones, flesh, skin must be the same as before death.

When Jesus returns on a cloud of angels the sea becomes fire. Some wicked are devoured by worms. Special punishment is given women

2. **THE APOCALYPSE OF PAUL**

This purports to be what Paul saw when he was transported to the third heaven—see Cor. 12:2. It is apparent that Dante got much of the material for his Inferno from this document.

This story ranges far and wide.

This book was found when digging for a house foundation in Tarsus. Was taken to the Emperor at Rome who opened the box.

There is an interesting account of the work of the recording angels. There seems to be two kinds of angels—good and bad. This revelation teaches the resurrection of the identical body of death—contrary to teaching in the New Testament letters.

He sees in Paradise the names of the saints in golden letters on the walls of the city. He saw rivers of milk and honey and the tree of life with 12 fruits. Date trees with clusters of 10,000. Grapes with 10,000 on a bunch. Paul learns that the root of all evil is pride.

He is taken to a special city—the city of Christ, where he sees rivers of milk, honey, oil, wine, etc. There was a river of fire and another neither hot nor cold for lukewarm and indifferent mortals. There was a deep pit for some offenders—it required five hundred years to reach the bottom.

The hardhearted were put naked in a region of ice and snow, with worms to gnaw their flesh. Paul visits with Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—also Job, Enoch, and John the Baptist.

3. **THE APOCALYPSE OF THOMAS**

Much about the last judgments on earth—rain of blood, etc. Depicts the end of the world, but contains little not found in other writing attributed to Thomas.

4. **THE REVELATION OF STEPHEN**

The story of Saul seeing Stephen stoned to death. Gamaliel rebukes Saul.

#### H. **SUNDRY DOCUMENTS**

1. **THE APOSTLES’ CREED**

“Peter—1. I believe in God the Father Almighty;

“John—2. Maker of heaven and earth;

“James—3. And in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord;

“Simon Zelotes—10. The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins;

“Jude, the brother of James—11. The resurrection of the body;

“Matthias—12. Life everlasting. Amen.”

2. **EPISTLE OF BARNABAS**

This is one of the best of all the Apocrypha—almost worthy of a place in the New Testament Canon. One of the few apocryphal books without miracles.

Denounces sacrifices and burnt offerings. Quotes much from the Old Testament, Daniel, Isaiah, and others. Refers to many prophecies concerning Christ. Discusses the spiritual aspects of circumcision, etc. Treats the spiritual meaning of clean and unclean beasts, and claims that baptism and the cross were foretold in prophecy. Claims that God’s promises refer to the gentiles as well as to the Jews.

Discusses the spiritual aspects of Sabbath keeping, and portrays the real meaning of the temple and its services.

Teaches the “way of life”—the things a Christian must be and do in order to be happy.

In Chapter 14, Verse 11, he seems to offer objections to birth control, as well as to abortion and infanticide. And then he portrays the “way of darkness”—the path to destruction.
