2. There are those who believe in an ever-expanding universe of infinity.
3. The present master universe is delimited—bounded on its outer margins by open space.

## 2. THE DOMAINS OF THE UNQUALIFIED ABSOLUTE

### I. UB 12:2.1 — “When Urantia astronomers...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_1) — “When Urantia astronomers...”

A new order of creation is taking place in outer space. The Corps of the Finality is destined to serve on these new spheres.

## 3. UNIVERSAL GRAVITY

### I. UB 12:3.1 — “All forms of force-energy...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_1) — “All forms of force-energy...”

**COMMENT**

1. All forms of reality are subject to the grasp of the universal gravity circuits.
2. The Universal Father functions over all four of the gravity circuits of the master universe:
	- A. Personality Gravity of the Father.
	- B. Spirit Gravity of the Eternal Son.
	- C. Mind Gravity of the Conjoint Actor.
	- D. Cosmic Gravity of Paradise.

### II. UB 12:3.6 — “These four circuits...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_6) — “These four circuits...”

**COMMENT**

These circuits are not related to nether Paradise—they are **presence** circuits.

### III. UB 12:3.7 — “In this connection...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_7) — “In this connection...”

**COMMENT**

Report concerning a study of gravity systems.

### IV. UB 12:3.8 — “1. Physical Gravity...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_8) — “1. Physical Gravity...”

**COMMENT**

1. After computing the total gravity active from Paradise, it is found that the grand universe is making use of only five per cent of such gravity.
2. These calculations refer to absolute gravity.

### V. UB 12:3.9 — “2. Spiritual Gravity...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_9) — “2. Spiritual Gravity...”

**COMMENT**

1. In the case of spirit gravity it is found that the spirit gravity of the grand universe is about the same as the estimated total for the active function of the Eternal Son.
2. This suggests that the now forming universes of outer space are nonspiritual.

### VI. UB 12:3.10 — “3. Mind Gravity...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_10) — “3. Mind Gravity...”

**COMMENT**

1. It is more difficult to estimate total mind gravity, but it has been attempted.
2. It is found that about 85 per cent of mind gravity is accounted for by the grand universe.
3. This suggests that 15 per cent of mind gravity may be functioning in outer space. These intelligences are apparently nonspiritual in nature.

### VII. UB 12:3.11 — “But all these...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_11) — “But all these...”

### II. UB 12:4.2 — “The Unqualified Absolute...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_2) — “The Unqualified Absolute...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Unqualified Absolute is functionally limited to space. His relation to motion is uncertain.
2. Motion is not inherent in space—not even the motion **of** space.
3. There are three opinions regarding the origin of motion.

### III. UB 12:4.6 — “In outer space...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_6) — “In outer space...”

**COMMENT**

The Unqualified Absolute must prepare space for the functioning of the force organizers.

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_7) — “Space is...”

**COMMENT**

Space is real, it even moves. Space motions may be classified as follows:
1. Primary motion.
2. Secondary motion.
3. Relative motions.

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_13) — “When the universes...”

**COMMENT**

The work of cosmic respiration is **space** work—not power-energy work.

### VII. UB 12:4.14 — “Although your spectroscopic...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_14) — “Although your spectroscopic...”

**COMMENT**

1. Spectroscopic estimations of outer space velocities are unreliable.
2. The theory of increased velocity according to distance is false. This error is due to angles of observation and other time-space distortions.

### VIII. UB 12:4.15 — “But the greatest...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_15) — “But the greatest...”

**COMMENT**

The greatest distortion is due to the alternating direction of the space paths around Paradise.

### IX. UB 12:4.16 — “It is probable...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_6) — “It is probable...”

**COMMENT**

These alternate directions of the space paths around Paradise are concerned in the gravity control of the cosmos.

## 5. SPACE AND TIME

### I. UB 12:5.1 — “Like space...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_1) — “Like space...”

**COMMENT**

1. Time is a bestowal of Paradise, but not like space. Time comes from motion because mind is aware of sequentiality.
2. Motion is essential to time, but the only universal time unit is the Paradise day.

### II. UB 12:5.2 — “Space is not infinite...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_2) — “Space is not infinite...”

**COMMENT**

Space is neither infinite nor absolute, but the absolute of time is eternity.

### III. UB 12:5.3 — “Time and space...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_3) — “Time and space...”

**COMMENT**

Time and space are inseparable only in the finite cosmos. Nonspatial time exists only in the Paradise mind.

### IV. UB 12:5.4 — “The relatively motionless...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_4) — “The relatively motionless...”

**COMMENT**

1. The relatively motionless midspace zones impinging on Paradise are the transition zones from tine to eternity.
2. Time-conscious beings can visit Paradise, but unconsciousness precedes Paradise citizenship.

### V. UB 12:5.5 — “Relationships to time...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_5) — “Relationships to time...”

**COMMENT**

1. Motion is essential to space relationships, but consciousness of time can exist without motion.
2. Man’s mind is less time-bound than space-bound. Imagination is comparatively time free.

### VI. UB 12:5.6 — “There are three...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_6) — “There are three...”

**COMMENT**

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_10) — “Unspiritual animals know...”

**COMMENT**

1. Animals know only the past; man has insight—may know the future.
2. Reality is progressive—static morality is but slightly superanimal.
3. Stoicism is not a high order of self-realization. Human ethics are dynamic.

### VIII. UB 12:5.11 — “The human personality...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_11) — “The human personality...”

**COMMENT**

Personality is not merely a concomitant of time-space events; personality can cause cosmic events.

## 6. UNIVERSAL OVERCONTROL

### I. UB 12:6.1 — “The universe is nonstatic...”

**REFERENCE:**[UB 12:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_1) — “The universe is nonstatic...”

**COMMENT**

The universe is nonstatic—stability is proportional to divinity—it is not due to inertia, but results from:
1. Balanced energies.
2. Co-operative minds.
3. Co-ordinated morontias.
4. Spirit overcontrol.
5. Personality unification.

### II. UB 12:6.2 — “In the physical control...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_2) — “In the physical control...”

**COMMENT**

The master universe is controlled by the Universal Father through:
1. Physical—the Isle of Paradise.
2. Spiritual—the Eternal Son.
3. Mindal—the Conjoint Actor.

### III. UB 12:6.3 — “The Third Source...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_3) — “The Third Source...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Conjoint Actor contributes to the co-ordination of the cosmos by:
	- A. Absoluteness of cosmic mind control.
	- B. Physical- and spiritual-gravity complements.
2. Mind functions wherever the material and the spiritual become interassociated.

### IV. UB 12:6.4 — “In all your contemplation...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_4) — “In all your contemplation...”

**COMMENT**

When physical, mindal, and spiritual energies are associated, you must reckon with:
1. Unification by personality.
2. Reactions of experiential Deity.
3. Actions of the Absolutes.

### V. UB 12:6.5 — “The universe is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_5) — “The universe is...”

**COMMENT**

1. The universe is predictable only in the quantitative or gravity-measurement sense.
2. Primal energies, mind meanings, and spirit values are not subject to linear gravity.
3. Qualitatively, the cosmos is only partially predictable.
4. We can never fully predict the decisions of freewill beings.

### VI. UB 12:6.6 — “All phases...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_6) — “All phases...”

**COMMENT**

1. Even nonpersonal realities react with more or less elasticity in any given isolated situation.
2. These unpredictable reactions of energy, mind, or other phenomena are probably due to the Ultimate and the Absolutes.

### VII. UB 12:6.7 — “We do not really know...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_7) — “We do not really know...”

**COMMENT**

Diversity of reaction in the presence of uniform causation suggests the action of the Absolutes.

### VIII. UB 12:6.8 — “Individuals have...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_8) — “Individuals have...”

**COMMENT**

Individuals, planets, and universes have their guardians—but who looks after the master universe? Probably—
1. The Absolutes in potential.
2. The Ultimate in direction.
3. The Supreme in evolutionary co-ordination.
4. The Architects of the Master Universe in administration prior to the appearance of specific rulers.

### IX. UB 12:6.13 — “The Unqualified Absolute...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_13) — “The Unqualified Absolute...”

3. The will of God may not prevail in the part, but it always does in the whole.

### II. UB 12:7.2 — “In all his dealings...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p7_2) — “In all his dealings...”

**COMMENT**

1. Owing to a finite viewpoint, God’s acts may appear to be arbitrary.

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_3) — “Mathematics, material science...”

**COMMENT**

1. Mathematics is indispensable to an understanding of the cosmos, but it is not a part of spiritual realities.

**REFERENCE**: [UB 12:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_4) — “Technical analysis...”
