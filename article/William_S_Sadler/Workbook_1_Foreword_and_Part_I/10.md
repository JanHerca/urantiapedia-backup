## INTRODUCTION

### I. UB 10:0.1 — “The Paradise Trinity...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p0_1) — “The Paradise Trinity...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity facilitates the Father’s escape from personality absolutism.
2. The Trinity associates God’s infinite will with the absoluteness of Deity.
3. The Son and the Spirit provide for the Father’s liberation from the limitations of primacy, perfection, changelessness, eternity, universality, absoluteness, infinity.

### II. UB 10:0.2 — “The Paradise Trinity effectively...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p0_2) — “The Paradise Trinity effectively...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity provides for the full revelation of Deity.
2. The Stationary Sons of the Trinity provide for the full revelation of justice.
3. The Stationary Sons are:
	- T.initized Secrets of Supremacy.
	- E.ernals of Days.
	- A.cients of Days.
	- P.rfections of Days.
	- R.cents of Days.
	- U.ions of Days.
	- F.ithfuls of Days.
	- P.rfectors of Wisdom.
	- D.vine Counselors.
	- U.iversal Censors.

### III. UB 10:0.3 — “From the present situation...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p0_3) — “From the present situation...”

**COMMENT**

1. Looking back on the circle of eternity, the Trinity is deemed to have been inevitable.
2. Without the Trinity, that which is could not have been.
3. No concept of creation is equal to the absoluteness of Deity unity associated with the volitional liberation of personalization.

## 1. SELF-DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER

### I. UB 10:1.1 — “It would seem...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_1) — “It would seem...”

**COMMENT**

1. In the Father’s policy of self-distribution, he reserves only those powers which are impossible of delegation or bestowal.
2. The unselfish Father provides for the fullest possible experience for all his associates and creatures.

### II. UB 10:1.2 — “The Universal Father...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_2) — “The Universal Father...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Father bestows upon his Sons all power and authority.
2. He makes each Creator Son just as authoritative as would be the Eternal Son.
3. Upon all persons, everywhere, God has bestowed everything of himself that is bestowable.

### III. UB 10:1.3 — “Divine personality...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_3) — “Divine personality...”

**COMMENT**

Deity is not self-centered. The Father shares reality of being, equality of self, with the Son and the Spirit.

### IV. UB 10:1.4 — “For knowledge concerning...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_4) — “For knowledge concerning...”

**COMMENT**

1. For knowledge of the Father we must depend on the Son. The Father has ceased to exist as an unqualified personality.
2. God bestowed absolute personality upon the Son—they both gave their conjoint personality to the Spirit.

### V. UB 10:1.5 — “For these and other reasons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_5) — “For these and other reasons...”

**COMMENT**

So it becomes difficult to know God except as revealed by the Son and ministered by the Spirit.

### VI. UB 10:1.6 — “Since the Paradise Sons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_6) — “Since the Paradise Sons...”

**COMMENT**

Man’s best understanding of Deity is derived from the incarnations of the Paradise bestowal Sons.

## 2. DEITY PERSONALIZATION

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_1) — “By the technique...”

**COMMENT**

1. God, by divesting himself of absolute personality, becomes the potential Father of all other universe personalities—the Universal Father.
2. As absolute personality, the Father can function only with the Son.
3. As personal Father he is not limited in the bestowal of personality upon the creatures of the far-flung cosmos.

### II. UB 10:2.2 — “After the Father...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_2) — “After the Father...”

**COMMENT**

The joint bestowal, by the Father and the Son, of conjoint personality upon the Infinite Spirit completes the existential personalization of Deity.

### III. UB 10:2.3 — “The Son is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_3) — “The Son is...”

**COMMENT**

### IV. UB 10:2.4 — “The First Source...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_4) — “The First Source...”

**COMMENT**

1. The First Person of Deity is the infinite father-personality.
2. The Eternal Son is the unqualified personality—absolute.
3. The Spirit is the unique conjoint personality.

### V. UB 10:2.5 — “The personality of...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_5) — “The personality of...”

**COMMENT**

1. The personality of the Father is the personality of infinity minus the absolute personality of the Eternal Son.
2. The personality of the Infinite Spirit is the superadditive bestowal of:
	- A. The liberated Father-personality.
	- B. The absolute Son-personality.

### VI. UB 10:2.6 — “The Universal Father...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_6) — “The Universal Father...”

**COMMENT**

The Father, Son, and Spirit are each unique, individual, and original.

### VII. UB 10:2.7 — “The Eternal Son alone...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_7) — “The Eternal Son alone...”

**COMMENT**

1. Only the Eternal Son experiences the fullest possible personality relationship:
	- A. Sonship with the Father.
	- B. With the Father, joint paternity of the Spirit.
	- C. Equality with both Father and Spirit.
2. The Father knows the experience of having a Son—but he knows no ancestral antecedents.
3. The Eternal Son enjoys a dual experience:
	- A. The experience of having a Father.
	- B. The experience of being co-parent to the Infinite Spirit.
4. The Spirit enjoys the experience of twofold personality ancestry.

### VIII. UB 10:2.8 — “I am of origin...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_8) — “I am of origin...”

**COMMENT**

The Universal Censor depicts various Trinity associations and explains why universe reality appears in seven variations of values, meanings, and personality.

## 3. THE THREE PERSONS OF DEITY

### I. UB 10:3.1 — “Notwithstanding there is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_1) — “Notwithstanding there is...”

**COMMENT**

1. There is only one Deity—but three personalizations.
2. In endowing man with the Adjuster, God said: “Let us make man in our own image.” This is **[Gen 1:26](/en/Bible/Genesis/1#v26)**. “Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’”
3. **Note**: Plural Deity. The Creator addresses an equal—”us.” Thus, the first chapter of our Bible recognizes the Trinity.

### II. UB 10:3.2 — “We are taught...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_2) — “We are taught...”

**COMMENT**

As viewed in the finite cosmos, the persons of the Trinity disclose diverse relationships with the universes.

### III. UB 10:3.3 — “The divine Sons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_3) — “The divine Sons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_4) — “The Father, Son, and Spirit...”

**COMMENT**

Deities differ in their universe performances. When acting alone they seem to be limited in absoluteness.

### V. UB 10:3.5 — “The Universal Father...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_5) — “The Universal Father...”

**COMMENT**

1. Before divesting himself of that which constitutes the Son and the Spirit, the Father was a Deity: unqualified, absolute, infinite.
2. God could never be a Father without a Son.
3. God could never have existed alone—this relation has always existed. The Deities are all eternal.

### VI. UB 10:3.6 — “We observe that...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_6) — “We observe that...”

1. The Father divested himself of all absoluteness except:
	- A. Absolute fatherhood.
	- B. Absolute volition.
2. The Father has infinity of WILL.

### VII. UB 10:3.7 — “In bestowing absoluteness...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_7) — “In bestowing absoluteness...”

**COMMENT**

1. In bestowing absolute personality on the Son, the Father makes it impossible for himself to act alone as the personality-absolute.
2. By eternalizing the Conjoint Actor, there ensues the trinitarian interdependence of all three of the Deities.

### VIII. UB 10:3.8 — “God is the...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_8) — “God is the...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_9) — “The First Source...”

**COMMENT**

God functions in the superuniverses in seven ways and mostly through other personalities or agencies.

### X. UB 10:3.17 — “All these relinquishments...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_17) — “All these relinquishments...”

**COMMENT**

Remember: All of the Father’s limitations of universe authority are self-imposed.

### XI. UB 10:3.18 — “The Eternal Son...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:3.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_18) — “The Eternal Son...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Conjoint Actor is amazingly versatile—performing in spheres of mind, matter, and spirit.
2. The Spirit acts for the Father-Son partnership and also for himself.
3. The Conjoint Actor does not work directly with:
	- A. The physical gravity circuit.
	- B. The spirit gravity circuit.
	- C. The personality circuit.
4. The Infinite Spirit exercises three supercontrols over even primary forces and energies—cosmic reality.

## 4. THE TRINITY UNION OF DEITY

### I. UB 10:4.1 — “Of all absolute...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_1) — “Of all absolute...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Paradise Trinity is the first trinity. The members of a triunity are partners rather than corporative, but the triunity itself is an association. The Father, Son, and Spirit make up the first triunity.
2. God functions as absolute Deity only in the Trinity and in relation to universe totality.

### II. UB 10:4.2 — “Eternal Deity is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_2) — “Eternal Deity is...”

**COMMENT**

The Trinity makes possible, at the same time, the expression of all the diversity and unity of Deity.

### III. UB 10:4.3 — “The Trinity is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_3) — “The Trinity is...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity is an association of infinite persons functioning in a nonpersonal capacity, but not in contravention of personality.
2. The Trinity is like the forming of a corporation by father, son, and grandson.

### IV. UB 10:4.4 — “The Paradise Trinity is...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_4) — “The Paradise Trinity is...”

**COMMENT**

The Deities can function personally, as the Trinity, or as two, or as all three in collaboration.

### V. UB 10:4.5 — “Ever remember that...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_5) — “Ever remember that...”

**COMMENT**

The Trinity mystery cannot be explained: three as one and in one.

### VI. UB 10:4.6 — “The Trinity is so related...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_6) — “The Trinity is so related...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity as related to universe totality must be recognized in contemplating any isolated cosmic event.
2. The Trinity functions on all levels of the cosmos. Man can have only a finite concept of the Trinity.

### VII. UB 10:4.7 — “As a mortal...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_7) — “As a mortal...”

**COMMENT**

Just now we have only a finite view of the Trinity, but as we ascend we discover Trinity supremacy and ultimacy—if not absoluteness.

## 5. FUNCTIONS OF THE TRINITY

### I. UB 10:5.1 — “The personal Deities...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_1) — “The personal Deities...”

**COMMENT**

1. Deities have attributes, but the Trinity has functions such as totality attitudes and cosmic overcontrol.
2. These functions may pertain to the supreme, ultimate, and even the absolute.

### II. UB 10:5.2 — “The functions of the...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_2) — “The functions of the...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity is not just the sum of the Father’s endowment plus the specialized attributes of the Son and the Spirit.
2. The Trinity results in deitization of new meanings, values, powers, and capacities.
3. Even creature associations are not augmented by mere arithmetical summation. Group potential exceeds the sum of the component parts.

### III. UB 10:5.3 — “The Trinity maintains...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_3) — “The Trinity maintains...”

**COMMENT**

Trinity attitudes may be presented in three groups:
1. **Attitude toward the Finite**. Trinity attitude toward the finite can best be understood by observation of the emerging Supreme Being. The Paradise Trinity in relation to the finite level is referred to as the Trinity of Supremacy.
2. **Attitude toward the Absonite**. This attitude may be comprehended by observation of the Ultimate. This relationship has been referred to as the Trinity of Ultimacy.
3. **The Absolute Attitude**. This represents the final action of total Deity.

### IV. UB 10:5.7 — “The Trinity Infinite...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_1_7) — “The Trinity Infinite...”

**COMMENT**

The Trinity Infinite involves total relationships of the First Source and Center—deified and undeified. It is all but beyond human comprehension.

### V. UB 10:5.8 — “But I do not...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_8) — “But I do not...”

Language is inadequate to portray the nature and functions of the Trinity.

## 6. THE STATIONARY SONS OF THE TRINITY

### I. UB 10:6.1 — “All law takes origin...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_1) — “All law takes origin...”

**COMMENT**

1. Law _originates_ in the First Source and Center.
2. Spiritual law _inheres_ in the Second Source.
3. Law is _interpreted_ by the Third Source.
4. Law is _applied_ by the Trinity (justice) through certain Sons.

### II. UB 10:6.2 — “_Justice_ is inherent...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_2) — “_Justice_ is inherent...”

**COMMENT**

1. Justice is inherent in the Trinity. Justice is the Trinity attitude of the personal Deities of love, mercy, and ministry.
2. No single person of Deity fosters justice. Justice is always a plural function.

### III. UB 10:6.3 — “**Evidence**, the basis of fairness...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_3) — “**Evidence**, the basis of fairness...”

**COMMENT**

The basis of _fairness_ (justice associated with mercy) is evidence and is supplied by the personalities of the Third Source and Center.

### IV. UB 10:6.4 — “_Judgment_, the final application...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_4) — “_Judgment_, the final application...”

**COMMENT**

Judgment, the application of justice, is the work of the Stationary Sons of the Trinity.

### V. UB 10:6.5 — “This group of Trinity Sons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_5) — “This group of Trinity Sons...”

**COMMENT**

This is a list of the 10 groups.

### VI. UB 10:6.16 — “We are the children...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_16) — “We are the children...”

**COMMENT**

These Trinity Sons represent the attitude of the Trinity only in the domains of executive judgment—justice. They were created for that purpose.

### VII. UB 10:6.17 — “The Ancients of Days...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_17) — “The Ancients of Days...”

**COMMENT**

The centers of final executive judgment are the headquarters of the seven superuniverses, where the Ancients of Days and their associates hold court.

### VIII. UB 10:6.18 — “Justice is the...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_18) — “Justice is the...”

**COMMENT**

1. Mercy is the personal attitude of love; justice, the collective decision of law. Divine judgment is the soul of fairness.
2. Man cannot fully understand that the love of the Father and the justice of the Trinity are in reality co-ordinate.

## 7. THE OVERCONTROL OF SUPREMACY

### I. UB 10:7.1 — “The First, Second...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_1) — “The First, Second...”

**COMMENT**

2. There is perfection of purpose and oneness of execution in the acts of the Trinity.
3. The Father, Son, and Spirit are **one**. See **[Isa 44:6](/en/Bible/Isaiah/44#v6)**. “Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel...’I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.’”

### II. UB 10:7.2 — “As things appear...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_2) — “As things appear...”

**COMMENT**

The Trinity appears to be concerned only with totals—planets or universes. This totality attitude derives from the fact that the Trinity is total Deity.

### III. UB 10:7.3 — “The Supreme Being...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_3) — “The Supreme Being...”

**COMMENT**

1. While the Supreme Being is something other than the Trinity, in this age he does appear to reflect the Trinity attitude toward the finite level.
2. The Deities do not personally function with the Supreme—only as the Trinity.
3. The relation of the Trinity to the Supreme when he is finally evolved is not known.

### IV. UB 10:7.4 — “We do not find...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_4) — “We do not find...”

**COMMENT**

The overcontrol of Supremacy is not wholly predictable—the earmark of the partial finite reaction to the Trinity.

### V. UB 10:7.5 — “The Mortal mind...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_5) — “The Mortal mind...”

**COMMENT**

1. While many mysterious things work out for the welfare of the universe, there are events which are hard to understand, such as: physical catastrophes, appalling accidents, horrific disasters, painful illnesses, and world-wide scourges.
2. Maybe these inexplicable vicissitudes of living are all meaningful in the overcontrol of the Supreme and the Trinity.

### VI. UB 10:7.6 — “As a son of God...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_6) — “As a son of God...”

**COMMENT**

As sons of God, mortals can comprehend the love attitude of the Father, but they cannot always recognize the acts of the Trinity as being meaningful and considerate.

## 8. THE TRINITY BEYOND THE FINITE

### I. UB 10:8.1 — “Many truths and facts...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_1) — “Many truths and facts...”

**COMMENT**

Mortals can only understand the Trinity by recognizing that many of its acts transcend the finite.

### II. UB 10:8.2 — “It would be inadvisable...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_2) — “It would be inadvisable...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity of Ultimacy is only partially understood by Transcendentalers.
2. The Ultimate is a qualified representation of Trinity function on the absonite level of universe reality.

### III. UB 10:8.3 — “The Universal Father...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_3) — “The Universal Father...”

**COMMENT**

The total Deity function of the Trinity transcends both the finite and the absonite.

### IV. UB 10:8.4 — “While no single person...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_4) — “While no single person...”

**COMMENT**

It would seem that three Deities are required to activate the potential of total Deity—the Deity Absolute.

### V. UB 10:8.5 — “We know the...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_5) — “We know the...”

**COMMENT**

The author knows the three Gods as persons and worships them. He does not personally know the Deity Absolute, whom he respects and honors.

### VI. UB 10:8.6 — “I once sojourned...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_6) — “I once sojourned...”

**COMMENT**

The theory of finaliters becoming the children of the Deity Absolute is presented.

### VII. UB 10:8.7 — “The Corps of the Finality...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_7) — “The Corps of the Finality...”

**COMMENT**

1. Finaliters really know God—they have attained perfection in doing the will of God.
2. Having attained God on the finite level, we will seek him on the absonite level.
3. We may attain the Ultimate, but it is doubtful if we will ever really attain absolute Deity.

### VIII. UB 10:8.8 — “It may be possible...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_8) — “It may be possible...”

**COMMENT**

1. Finaliters may partially attain the Deity Absolute.
2. But they can hardly attain the Universal Absolute, because the Universal will grow as the universes expand.

### IX. UB 10:8.9 — “Only infinity can...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 10:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p8_9) — “Only infinity can...”

**COMMENT**

Only infinity can disclose the Father-Infinite.

13. The relation of the Trinity to the Supreme Being is discussed in several papers and numerous passages.
14. The word “Trinity” first appears in Greek in A.D. 181, used by Theophilus of Antioch. The Latin word from which we derive our English was first used by Tertullian in A.D. 200. There are other common theologic words not found in the Bible, for example, incarnation.

## THE TRINITY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT

**[Gen 1:26](/en/Bible/Genesis/1#v26)**. “Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’”
**[Isa 63:10](/en/Bible/Isaiah/63#v10)**. “They rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit.”
**[Isa 6:3](/en/Bible/Isaiah/6#v3)**. “Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts.”
**[Num 6:24-26](/en/Bible/Numbers/6#v24)**. “The Lord bless you and keep you:
	The Lord make his face to shine upon you...
	The Lord lift up his countenance upon you...”

## THE TRINITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT

**[Eph 2:18](/en/Bible/Ephesians/2#v18)**. “Through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.”
**[Acts 2:33](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v33)**. “Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit.”

## OTHER REFERENCES IN THE URANTIA BOOK

1. **Absolute Unity**. “In the Paradise Trinity there is absolute unity despite the eternal identities of the co-ordinates of God.” [UB 2:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p6_7)
2. **The Trinity as Creators**. “The Paradise Trinity is existent. The stage of universal space is set for the manifold and never-ending panorama of the creative unfolding of the purpose of the Universal Father through the personality of the Eternal Son and by the execution of the God of Action, the executive agency for the reality performances of the Father-Son creator partnership.” [UB 8:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p1_3)
3. **Trinity as Ancestor of Ancients of Days**. “The Ancients of Days are all basically identical; they disclose the combined character and unified nature of the Trinity. They possess individuality and are in personality diverse, but they do not differ from each other as do the Seven Master Spirits. They provide the uniform directorship of the otherwise differing seven superuniverses, each of which is a distinct, segregated, and unique creation. The Seven Master Spirits are unlike in nature and attributes, but the Ancients of Days, the personal rulers of the superuniverses, are all uniform and superperfect offspring of the Paradise Trinity.” [UB 18:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p3_2)
4. **The Trinity Emblem**. “In personal appearance, Melchizedek resembled the then blended Nodite and Sumerian peoples, being almost six feet in height and possessing a commanding presence. He spoke Chaldean and a half dozen other languages. He dressed much as did the Canaanite priests except that on his breast he wore an emblem of three concentric circles, the Satania symbol of the Paradise Trinity. In the course of his ministry this insignia of three concentric circles became regarded as so sacred by his followers that they never dared to use it, and it was soon forgotten with the passing of a few generations.” [UB 93:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_5)
5. The whole of Paper 104 [UB 104:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p0_1) is devoted to the growth of the Trinity concept on Urantia.
6. **Relation to the Supreme Being**. “The source of the Supreme is in the Paradise Trinity—eternal, actual, and undivided Deity. The Supreme is first of all a spirit person, and this spirit person stems from the Trinity. But the Supreme is secondly a Deity of growth—evolutionary growth—and this growth derives from the two triodities, actual and potential.” [UB 115:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p4_2)
7. **The Trinity Was Inevitable**. “The Paradise Trinity is considered to be the absolute inevitability; the Seven Master Spirits are apparently Trinity inevitabilities; the power-mind-spirit-personality actualization of the Supreme must be the evolutionary inevitability.” [UB 115:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p7_5)
8. **The Finaliter Oath is to the Trinity**. “When mortal ascenders are admitted to the finaliter corps of Paradise, they take an oath to the Paradise Trinity, and in taking this oath of allegiance, they are thereby pledging eternal fidelity to God the Supreme, who **is** the Trinity as comprehended by all finite creature personalities. Subsequently, as the companies function throughout the evolving universes, they are solely amenable to the mandates of Paradise origin until the eventful times of the settling of local universes in light and life. As the new governmental organizations of these perfected creations begin to be reflective of the emerging sovereignty of the Supreme, we observe that the outlying finaliter companies then acknowledge the jurisdictional authority of such new governments. It appears that God the Supreme is evolving as the unifier of the evolutionary Corps of the Finality, but it is highly probable that the eternal destiny of these seven corps will be directed by the Supreme as a member of the Ultimate Trinity.” [UB 117:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p7_7)
