## II. Authorship

1. Joel was the author and he lived in or near Jerusalem.
2. He has been called the "temple prophet."
3. The book was written about 350 B.C.; certainly, later than 400.
4. Joel was a great borrower. He quotes, without credit, from Isaiah, Ezekiel, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Psalms, Nehemiah, Exodus, Jonah, Zechariah, Amos, and Micah.
5. His quoting from so many prophets makes him one of the later prophets.

## III. Look at the book

1. It is a rhythmic book-even when not in poetic form.
2. Joel is clever in using contrasts, repetitions, metaphors, and alliterations.
3. The real locust plague he describes is attributed to Yahweh, because of wrongdoing; the curse is removed upon repentance. (Joel did not know about the 17-year locusts.)
4. The exponents of the "social gospel" point to Joel to prove that man's spiritual capacity is improved by satisfaction of physical needs.
5. It was Joel's prediction of the pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh that Peter quoted on the Day of Pentecost. ([Acts 2:16-21](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v16). [Joel 2:28-32](/en/Bible/Joel/2#v28))
6. But for the time being, God's spirit dwelt only with Israel.
7. Cried Joel: "Rend your hearts and not your garments." [2:13](/en/Bible/Joel/2#v13).
8. Joel pronounced judgment upon all nations who had sold Jews into slavery.

## IV. Leading Ideas

1. Blessings and judgments through nature (the locusts).
2. Necessity for heartfelt repentance.
3. Salvation by grace through faith.
4. Importance of formal worship.
5. Israel as the "chosen people."
6. God in history.
7. The "Day of the Lord."
8. Outpouring of the Spirit.
9. Final judgment of the nations.
10. Final blessings of Israel.
11. The little book of Joel had considerable influence upon many writers of the New Testament.

## V. Selected Texts

1. **Rend your hearts**. "'Rend your hearts and not your garments.' Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and repents of evil." [2:13](/en/Bible/Joel/2#v13).
2. **Pouring out the spirit**. "'And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh.'" [2:28](/en/Bible/Joel/2#v28).
3. **Darkened sun and moon**. "'The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.'" [2:31](/en/Bible/Joel/2#v31).
4. **Plowshares into swords**. "Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say 'I am a warrior.'" [3:10](/en/Bible/Joel/3#v10).
5. **The valley of decision**. "Multitudes, multitides, in the valley of decision!" [3:14](/en/Bible/Joel/3#v14).
