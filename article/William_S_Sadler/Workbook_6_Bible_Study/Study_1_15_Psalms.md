	- David-[79](/en/Bible/Psalms/79).
	- Asaph-[12](/en/Bible/Psalms/12).

## III. General Considerations

1. In general, the Bible presents man talking to man, or God speaking to man, but Psalms presents man talking to God.
2. The philosophy and theology of the psalms cover a time period of almost one thousand years.
3. Each book of Psalms ends with a doxology. The last book has the last psalm as its doxology.
4. Psalms covers the whole gamut of human emotions, cheerful confidence and anxious foreboding, joyful faith and brooding despondency, loving kindness and bitter animosity, tenderness and ruthlessness.
5. The theology of Psalms ranges from the near-pagan to the high levels of the Second Isaiah.
6. The range is from praise, prayer, and thanksgiving to sublime worship.
7. Psalms is the prayer and hymn book of both Judaism and the Christian church.
8. In Books 2 and 3 the name of Deity has been changed from Yahweh to Elohim.
9. [Ps. 104:19-23](/en/Bible/Psalms/104#v19) sounds like the Egyptian Hymn to Aton-by Amenophis IV (Ikhnaton).
10. There is a lot of modern psychiatry in the book of Psalms.
11. Many of the psalms were intended to be accompanied by music-wind instruments, string instruments, and percussion.
12. Psalms ranges from private prayers to all phases of public worship.

## V. The Psalter as a compilation

1. Both great variety and duplications suggest compilation.
2. Use of both Yahweh and Elohim for God shows different theologic concepts.
3. Assumption of many authors indicates compilation.
4. Wide range of doctrine shows that the individual psalms had origin over a very wide time range.
5. All but 34 psalms have some sort of superscription attached-songs for private or temple worship, Sabbath, or weddings, etc.
6. Diverse poetic structure:
	- A. **Synonymous**. Second line repeats thought of the first.
		"Hear this, all peoples!
		"Give ear, all inhabitants of the world." [49:1](/en/Bible/Psalms/49#v1).
	- B. **Antithetic**. Second line antithetic to the first.
		"For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
		"but the way of the wicked will perish." [1:6](/en/Bible/Psalms/1#v6). hill." [3:4](/en/Bible/Psalms/3#v4).
	- C. **Synthetic**. The second line completes the first.
		"I cry aloud to the Lord,
		"and he answers me from his holy hill." [3:4](/en/Bible/Psalms/3#v4).
7. Some psalms are in stanzas, others acrostic in structure.

## VI. Religion of the psalmists

1. The Psalter does not present any systematic scheme of Jewish theology.
2. The God concept is monotheistic, although reference is made to other "gods."
3. God is righteous, just, merciful, and gracious. And he hears the prayers of his servants.
4. The world is the handiwork of God. The psalmists are not nature lovers.
5. Man lives his life and perishes "like the beasts of the field." There are but hints of survival beyond the grave.
6. The people of God are the Hebrews, but there are references to the fact that God rules and judges all nations.
7. But oh the whole, the psalms present a rugged Hebrew nationalism.
8. The cult us is upheld, but there is scant attention paid to "blood" and the sacrifices. The temple is venerated, but some of its ceremonies are slighted.
9. Certain psalms allude to the universal rule of Israel's God. They also refer to times when all men worship God.
10. In general, the psalms refer to the "goodness of the Lord to the land of the living," but they also talk about the day of Judgment and the end of the world.
11. Many of the psalms reflect the philosophy and religious beliefs of many ancient peoples-Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Persian.
12. Many psalms can hardly be called Christian. Note the following psalms of the imprecatory category-breathing vengeance: Ps. 58, 59, 69, 109, 137, and 149.

## VII. Psalms in worship

1. The psalms were a part of the olden temple worship.
2. The psalms were associated with the annual Jewish feasts-First Fruits, Tabernacles, Pentecost, etc.
3. There is little information as to the use of the psalms in synagogue worship.
4. The psalms are still used in modern Jewish worship.
5. The Psalter has always been a part of worship in Christian churches.
6. There are 93 quotations from the Psalms in the New Testament.
7. Of all Old Testament books, the Psalter is the one book to be wholeheartedly adopted by the Christian church.
8. In contrast to the psalms of pagan hate and revenge, attention should be called to such beautiful hymns of praise, thanksgiving, and worship as Psalms 8, 29, 51, 62, 84, 105, and 106.
