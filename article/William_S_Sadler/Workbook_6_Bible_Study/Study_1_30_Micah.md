## III. Micah and his times

1. Micah does not talk much about either idolatry or immortality. His message is: "Do justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God."
3. The three parts of the book deal with:
	- A. Judgment.
	- B. Comfort.
	- C. Salvation.
4. Micah longed for a universal religion.
5. Almost a hundred years later, Jeremiah remembered Micah. ([Jer 26:18,19)](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/26#v18)
6. He exposed the dishonest and corrupt officials.
7. Micah was not in the literary class of Deutero-Isaiah and Amos, but he was far superior to Ezekiel.
8. Micah is one of the best unified books in the Old Testament. It has received but little editorial tampering.
9. Micah started the campaign of "social reform" that was taken up by Zephaniah, the psalmists, John the Baptist, Jesus, Francis of Assisi, and John Wesley.

## IV. Selected Texts

4. **Individual character**. "They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid." [4:4](/en/Bible/Micah/4#v4).
5. **Worthless sacrifices**. "'Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?'" [6:7](/en/Bible/Micah/6#v7).
6. **What the Lord requires**. "'He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?'" [6:8](/en/Bible/Micah/6#v8).
7. **Attributes of God**. "Who is a God like thee, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever because he delights in steadfast love." [7:18](/en/Bible/Micah/7#v18).
