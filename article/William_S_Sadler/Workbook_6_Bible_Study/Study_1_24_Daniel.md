## III. Historical Background

1. Greek culture is spreading and a Greek Bible is produced.
2. In 175 B.C. Antiochus IV (Epiphanes) becomes ruler of the Seleucid empire.
3. Antiochus determines to stamp out the Jewish religion. He plunders the temple, kills Jews, and razes the walls of Jerusalem.
4. In 168 B.C. he sets up an altar in the temple (Jupiter), profanes the Sabbath, and forbids circumcision.
5. All this brings on the Maccabean revolt. The temple was cleansed and rededicated.
6. The book of Daniel was written to help the Jews withstand the persecutions of Antiochus.
7. Antiochus died in his campaign against the Parthians in 163 B.C.

## IV. Composition of the book

1. Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream-the golden idol, and the fiery furnace.
2. Then comes the feast of Belshazzar and the lions' den.
3. Then the vision of the four beasts and the little horn.
4. Interpretation of the little horn:
	- A. Protestants, in general, have referred it to Antiochus Epiphanes.
	- B. Seventh Day Adventists and other sects refer it to the Papacy.
	- C. Others have referred it to Hitler, Stalin, etc.
5. Other visions have to do with empire history, Alexander the Great, and Roman history.
6. Daniel becomes "head of the wise men" of Babylon.

## V. Teachings of Daniel

1. Daniel is the first of the apocalyptic books-the doctrine of the end of the age.
2. The kingdom is literal-the Messiah sits on David's throne. It is an "everlasting kingdom."
3. Daniel presents an advanced theology regarding angels, survival, the resurrection, and many other features.
4. He presents the concept of "the Son of Man," along with Enoch, and may have had some part in Jesus' deciding to adopt such a title.
5. The theology is that God foreknows all things and determines everything.
6. In theology Daniel is midway between the doctrines of the olden prophets and the times of Jesus.
7. Daniel gives angels a new and enlarged personal dignity.
8. The book of Daniel is the prime textbook of all the Adventist denominations.
