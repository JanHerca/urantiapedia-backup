## I. Nature and Purpose

1. Who wrote the book under examination—and why?
2. When was it written and what was the background?
3. Remember: The Bible is neither history nor science.
4. The value of comparing the Bible text with The Urantia Book.
5. The Bible is essentially an Oriental—at least Levantine—book.
6. Study the meanings of the original text—Greek or Hebrew.
7. The division of Isaiah into three parts is a good illustration of proper technique for studying the Bible.
8. The use of a good Bible dictionary is very helpful. The latest: Harper’s Bible Dictionary, by Miller.
9. The great problem is interpretation. What does the text really mean?
10. Look for spiritual help—light. “Thy word is a lamp to my feet.” [Ps 119:105](/en/Bible/Psalms/119#v105).

## II. Chronology

1. The details of chronology will be considered in the study of Old and New Testament history.
2. The explanation for the extra long lives of ancient personalities is found in the Urantia Book [UB 77:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_10) The lunar month of 28 days was called a year. Thus a man living 900 years really lived only about 70 years— “three score years and ten”—a ripe old age for those days.
