## II. Authorship

1. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus in A.D. 54.
2. Paul sent four letters to the church at Corinth.
3. The first letter written from Ephesus has been lost, but a fragment ([2 Cor. 6:14-7:1](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/6#v14)) is thought to have been preserved.
4. The second letter is our 1 Corinthians.
5. Most of the third letter (referred to in [2 Cor 2:4](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/2#v4) and [7:8](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/7#v8)) is also lost. A fragment of it is believed to be [2 Cor. 10-13](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/10). It was written from Ephesus.
6. Paul's fourth letter is our [2 Corinthians 1-9](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/1) (except [6:14-7:1](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/6#v14)).
7. Paul spent eighteen months at Corinth. He wrote Romans and the two Thessa-Ionians.

## III. Occasion For The Letters

1. Apollos, of Alexandria, did considerable work in Corinth, Priacilla and Aquila gave him advanced instruction.
2. Peter may have visited this church, since there was a three-way division. Some said they were of Apollos, some Cephas, others Paul.
3. Paul's letter deals with the following troubles:
	- Party divisions.
	- Marriage.
	- Meat offered idols.
	- Spiritual gifts.
	- Incest.
	- Legal disputes.
	- Disorders at Lord's Supper.
	- Denial of the resurrection.
4. Speaking with tongues made trouble at Corinth-as well as in other churches.
5. This is not a doctrinal letter-it deals with practical and daily living problems.
6. Paul advocated women's wearing veils in church.
7. A keynote in Paul's advice: "Let all things be done decently and in order."
8. Always remember: In these early years, Paul was expecting the second advent of Christ any day.
9. Paul was a bang-up evangelist and the leading theologian of his time, but he was not a profound philosopher.
