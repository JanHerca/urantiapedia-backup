## I. Outline

1. Introduction. [v. 1-4](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v1).
2. Doom of Heretics. [5-16](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v5).
3. True Faith. [17-23](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v17).
4. Benediction. [24,25](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v24).

## II. Author and the time

1. Jude is a letter designed to combat heresy.
2. The author of 2 Peter knew Jude and quoted him.
3. This Jude claims kinship with James. Some authorities believe he was a brother of Jesus-a son of Joseph and Mary.
4. Jude quotes from the apocalyptic books of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses.
5. The trouble with Jude (the brother of Jesus) as the author is that he could hardly have lived to the times of the heresies he combats.
6. The date of writing was perhaps around A.D. 125.
7. The book of Jude was probably written from Home.

## III. The Message

1. Defense of the faith once delivered to the saints.
2. Denunciation of the deceptive teachings of ungodly persons.
3. An appeal to return to the early apostolic teachings.

## IV. Selected Texts

1. **True faith**. "To contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints." [v.3](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v3).
2. **Troublemakers**. "'In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.'" [v.18](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v18).
3. **Eternal security**. "Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with rejoicing," [v.24](/en/Bible/Jude/1#v24).
