## III. Authorship

1. In olden times First and Second Kings were one book.
2. The original book was a combination of J and E.
3. During and just after the glamour of the days of Josiah, there was a thorough revision by Deuteronomic editors.
4. And during the exile the P editors added their contributions.
5. Remember that it was Hilkiah who found Deuteronomy in the temple and so started the Josiah reforms.
6. Kings yields 51 Deuteronomic phrases-characteristic.
7. There were two definite Deuteronomic editors-the earlier and the later.

## IV. Sources

1. Olden oral traditions.
2. The Acts of Solomon. This is the lost biography of Solomon.
3. Another lost book-the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
4. Also lost-the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah.
5. It was probably written around 620 B.C.
6. Kings is a compilation from at least five different sources.

## V. Method and Purpose

1. The original author had a plan to deal with the northern and southern kingdoms contemporaneously.
2. The later editors held up Josiah as the ideal of a king of Davidic dynasty.
3. Monotheism is the theme song of Kings. "You shall have no other gods before me-I am a jealous God."
4. Israel's later troubles came because Solomon built shrines for the gods of his many wives:
	- A. The Zidonian Astarte.
	- B. Ammonite Melek. (Molech)
	- C. Moabite Chemosh.
5. The same old concept is upheld: obey God and prosper; disobey and suffer-meet with disaster.
6. This book concentrates all worship at Jerusalem.
7. Jehu was condemned because he tolerated sacrifices and worship at Bethel.
8. Ahab was a "bad king" because he tolerated idols; Hezekiah was a "good king" because he made a clean sweep of idols and shrines; he even threw out of the temple the bronze serpent of Mosea.
9. Manasseh was the really "bad king"-he made his sons pass through the fire, practiced augury, used enchantments, fraternized with "familiar spirits" and with wizards.
10. The plan of Kings is:
	- A. Date of king's accession, capital.
	- B. Age of king. Length of reign.
	- C. Name of queen mother.
	- D. King's attitude toward Deuteronomy.
	- E. Death and burial.
11. Only two kings won full approval: Hezekiah and Josiah.
12. The other kings "did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
13. The Elijah stories were not a part of the original book.
14. The wholesale condemnation of Israel's and Judah's kings was the work of the second or later Deuteronomic editor.

## VI. The Deuteronomic Editors

1. The first Deuteronomic editor finished his work soon after the death of Josiah (600 B.C.). There was another Deuteronomic revision about 550 B.C.
2. This second revision also included everything from Genesis to Kings.
3. The Deuteronomic editor explained Josiah's troubles upon the basis of suffering punishment for Manasseh's sins.
4. The second Deuteronomic editor knew about Cyrus and his activities. He may have also been influenced by the Second Isaiah.
5. These are also the times of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
6. The second Deuteronomic editor was less hostile toward the kings of the northern kingdom.
7. The period covered by Kings is a little over-four hundred years.

## VII. Tales of the North

1. The outstanding figures of the northern kingdom were Elijah, ELisha, and Ahab.
2. These stories had their origin in the north, because:
	- A. Nothing is said against the calf worship of Bethel.
	- B. No objection to sacrifice and worship at northern "high places."
	- C. Elijah repairs the altar on Mt. Carmel.
	- D. Elijah's work devoted to the overthrow of the altars of the Tyrian Baal-introduced by Ahab's Tyrian wife Jezebel.
3. The author of the Elijah stories was a skillful writer-as literature his work is the equal of any Old Testament writer.
4. The Elisha stories were written by a much less competent author-they are deficient in dramatic power.
5. The Elijah and Elisha stories show what a "wonder worker" age this was- the widow's food, the resurrected boy, the famine, the boys who ridiculed the prophet's baldness, and the bears.
6. The Ahab narratives had a different author.
7. The second Deuteronomic editor put all these stories together-tried to effect a conflation.

## VIII. Tales of the South

1. Sennacherib's attack on Judah and unexplained withdrawal (even though Hezekiah paid tribute).
2. Story of the miraculous destruction of the Assyrian army.
3. Hezekiah's sickness.
4. Insertion of stories like the embassy of Merodach-baladan which seems to be drawn from Isaiah.

## IX. Modern Significance

1. The folly of thinking God dwells in only **one** place.
2. The last Deuteronomic editor taught that God is ever willing to pardon and forgive.
3. All sin sets in motion a tragic train of consequences.
4. Out of the sorrows of exile, there may dawn the joy of new hopes.
5. Reading of the book of Kings should be followed by the comfort and promises of the Second Isaiah.
