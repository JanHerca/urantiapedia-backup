## III. Authorship

1. Jeremiah and his secretary, Baruch, wrote the original book.
2. Baruch's scroll was cut up and burned by King Jehoiakim, but Jeremiah re-dictated it. This was in December 605 B.C.
3. The book was added to up to the times of Zedekiah.
4. After the fall of Jerusalem a Deuteronomic editor revised the book and gave it the flavor of the "cult."
5. The memoirs section may have been written by Baruch while in Egypt.
6. The D editorship was completed about 550 B.C.
7. All of Chapter 24 seems to be the product of the D editor. This is also probably true of Chapter 45.
8. A common date of Jeremiah is 620 B.C.

## IV. Jeremiah and his message

1. Jeremiah was born during the reign of Josiah (640-609) and lived during the days of the downfall of empires.
2. Josiah was killed at Megiddo in the battle with Neco of Egypt.
3. Jehoiakim (son of Josiah) was placed on the throne by the king of Egypt, and his eleven years covered much of Jeremiah's activities.
4. This king was pompous and proud and rejected most of the council of Jeremiah.
5. After the battle of Carchemish he transferred his loyalty to Babylon.
6. When Jerusalem neglected to pay tribute, the king of Babylon took the city. He put another son of Josiah on the throne-Zedekiah. He was more friendly to Jeremiah.
7. Finally, the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and appointed Gedaliah governor. (August 587 B.C.)
8. In five years the governor was assassinated and Jeremiah with others fled to Egypt.
9. Jeremiah was born and grew up in a village two miles northeast of Jerusalem-Anathoth.
10. Jeremiah was influenced by Hosea-and quotes from him.
11. When Jeremiah prophesied trouble from the "north," the Jews thought he referred to the Scythians, but later decided that it was the Babylonians.
12. Jeremiah was never in full favor with the kings. Even Josiah consulted Huldah, the prophetess. ([2 Kings 22:14-20](/en/Bible/2_Kings/22#v14))
13. Jeremiah was not an advocate of Josiah's Deuteronomic reforms-in fact, opposed some of them.
14. Jeremiah always counseled submission to the Babylonians.
15. Jeremiah was always opposed to sacrifices.
16. When Jeremiah advised surrendering to the Babylonians, they cast him into a prison, where he sank in the mire up to his armpits.
17. To show his faith in the ultimate return from captivity, Jeremiah purchased a field in his native village.
18. The Babylonian governor took Jeremiah out of prison and gave him his liberty.
19. He was taken to Egypt against his will.
20. There is a legend that Jeremiah was stoned to death in Egypt by his exasperated fellow countrymen.
21. Jeremiah was not a mystic. He had a strong personality. We know more about the "inner life" of Jeremiah than of any other prophet.
22. It is possible that he was forbidden to marry. ([16:1-13](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/16#v1))
23. He suffered many seasons of bitterness and despair. But he was no "weeping prophet."
24. The idea of his being a "weeping prophet" comes from ascribing authorship of the book of Lamentations to him.
25. At one time he did pray for vengeance on his enemies-even on their wives and children.
26. Jeremiah was comforted by a very loyal negro servant.
27. Jeremiah came from a wealthy priestly family.
28. The kings and princes regarded Jeremiah as a traitor.
29. He proclaimed a "new covenant" to be "written upon men's hearts."
30. And this is the beginning of individual religion, as contrasted with nationalistic religion.

## V. Jeremiah's Theology

1. Jeremiah was not a theologian, but his writings were theologically sound.
2. He did not adore God with awe like Isaiah and Ezekiel; he wrestled with God like Jacob.
3. He believed in the sovereignty of God-God as the Creator of the natural order.
4. Yahweh was the controller and director of history.
5. He was "a God at hand and a God afar off"-both immanent and transcendent.
6. A God of love-justice, mercy, and power.
7. The Father of Israel.
8. "I have loved you with an everlasting love."
9. God wants not sacrifice and ritual, but repentance and obedience.
10. Jeremiah was a real monotheist.
11. He taught religion for the individual-rather than for the nation.
12. He taught a new covenant for the heart of each individual.
13. Yahweh deals with man's heart-seat of both mind and the emotions.
14. Jeremiah was the prophet of personal religious experience.
15. You will find God if you "seek him with a whole heart."
16. He taught the religion of sin, repentance, and salvation.
17. Human nature is fickle. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt." [17:9](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/17#v9).
18. He regarded man as being innately stubborn.
19. Repentance means "conscious turning away from all evil."
20. Jeremiah is author of the proverb about the Ethiopian changing his skin or the leopard his spots.
21. Motivation becomes a big part of religious experience.
