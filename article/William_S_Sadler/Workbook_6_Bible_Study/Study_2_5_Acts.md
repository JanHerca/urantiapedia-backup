## III. Authorship

1. Luke wrote the book of Acts, probably at Rome, about A.D. 90. He died just before finishing Acts. (See Urantia Book [UB 121:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_8).)
2. Luke was from Antioch of Pisidia.
3. He was a companion of Paul for several years-his private physician.
4. Paul refers to Luke as one of his fellow workers. Philemon v. 24.
5. The latter portion of Acts-the "we" sections-was based on Luke's diary.
6. The abrupt ending of Acts is explained by the author's death. Just how much is missing from what was planned, we will never know.
7. We have no knowledge as to when and by whose influence Luke became a Christian.

## IV. Looking At Acts

1. Like the Gospel of Luke, Acts is a superb literary production.
2. Without Acts, we would know very little concerning the early days of Christianity.
3. Luke's book of Acts helps us to understand the real difference between the religion **of** Jesus and the religion **about** Jesus.
4. Like Luke, Acts shows sympathy for the poor and antipathy for the rich, along with the sanctity of "stewardship."
5. Luke is greatly interested in women's part in gospel work.
6. The fullest account of the ascension of Jesus is found in Acts.
7. As in Luke, so in Acts the author always shows special interest in all things having a health or medical aspect.
8. Luke shows great interest in Paul-as a person-but neither Luke nor Acts reflects any interest in Paul's epistles.
9. Luke was a physician and Christian historian-not a theologian.

## V. Selected Texts

"As they were looking on he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight...behold, two men stood by them...and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
