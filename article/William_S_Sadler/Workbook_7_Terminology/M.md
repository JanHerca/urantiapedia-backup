## Magic

> Civilized man attacks the problems of a real environment through his science; savage man attempted to solve the real problems of an illusory ghost environment by magic. Magic was the technique of manipulating the conjectured spirit environment whose machinations endlessly explained the inexplicable; it was the art of obtaining voluntary spirit co-operation and of coercing involuntary spirit aid through the use of fetishes or other and more powerful spirits. [UB 88:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p4_1)

> Prayer is not an evolution of magic; they each arose independently. Magic was an attempt to adjust Deity to conditions; prayer is the effort to adjust the personality to the will of Deity. True prayer is both moral and religious; magic is neither. [UB 91:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_2)

## Major Sector

> One hundred minor sectors (about 1,000,000,000 inhabitable worlds ) make one major sector. Each major sector is provided with a superb headquarters and is presided over by three Perfections of Days, Supreme Trinity Personalities. [UB 15:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_7)

## Man

> Mortal man is very largely an unrealized spiritual potentiality. [UB 0:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p4_7)

> God is spirit - spirit personality; man is also a spirit - potential spirit personality. [UB 1:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_8)

> The Eternal Son is wholly spiritual; man is very nearly entirely material. [UB 6:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p6_4)

> The Adjuster is man’s eternity possibility; man is the Adjuster’s personality possibility. [UB 107:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_2)

> Mortal man is a machine, a living mechanism; his roots are truly in the physical world of energy. Many human reactions are mechanical in nature; much of life is machinelike. But man, a mechanism, is much more than a machine; he is mind endowed and spirit indwelt; and though he can never throughout his material life escape the chemical and electrical mechanics of his existence, he can increasingly learn how to subordinate this physical-life machine to the directive wisdom of experience by the process of consecrating the human mind to the execution of the spiritual urges of the indwelling Thought Adjuster. [UB 118:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_2)

> Man is the son of God, not a child of the devil. [UB 145:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_4)

## Marriage

> Marriage is the institutional response of the social organism to the everpresent biologic tension of man’s unremitting urge to reproduction-self propagation. Mating is universally natural, and as society evolved from the simple to the complex, there was a corresponding evolution of the mating mores, the genesis of the marital institution. Wherever social evolution has progressed to the stage at which mores are generated, marriage will be found as an evolving institution. [UB 82:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p3_1)

> Marriage—mating—grows out of bisexuality. Marriage is man’s reactional adjustment to such bisexuallty, while the family life is the sum total resulting from all such evolutionary and adaptative adjustments. Marriage is enduring; it is not inherent in biologic evolution, but it is the basis of all social evolution and is therefore certain of continued existence in some form. Marriage has given mankind the home, and the home is the crowning glory of the whole long arduous evolutionary struggle. [UB 82:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_1)

> Marriage which culminates in the home is indeed man’s most exalted institution, but it is essentially human; it should never have been called a sacrament. [UB 83:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_1)

> Marriage always has been and still is man’s supreme dream of temporal ideality. Though this.beautiful dream is seldom realized in its entirety, it endures as a glorious ideal, ever luring progressing mankind on to greater strivings for human happiness. But young men and women should be taught something of the realities of marriage before they are plunged into the exacting demands of the interassociations of family life; youthful idealization should be tempered with some degree of premarital disillusionment. [UB 83:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_6)

> Marriage, with children and consequent family life, is stimulative of the highest potentials in human nature and simultaneously provides the ideal avenue for the expression of these quickened attributes of mortal personality. [UB 84:7.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_28)

## Materialism

> Hence materialism, atheism, is the maximation of ugliness, the climax of the finite antithesis of the beautiful. [UB 56:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_4)

> Materialism reduces man to a soulless automaton and constitutes him merely an arithmetical symbol finding a helpless place in the mathematical formula of an unromantic and mechanistic universe. [UB 195:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_8)

## Matter

> Organized energy which is subject to linear gravity except as it is modified by motion and conditioned by mind. [UB 12:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p8_10)

> Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, energy, and matter are—in origin, nature, and destiny—one and the same thing, together with other material realities as yet undiscovered on Urantia. [UB 42:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_1)

> Physical matter is the time-space shadow of the Paradise energy-shining of the absolute deities. [UB 56:10.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_18)

## Maturity

> In the maturity of the developing self, the past and future are brought together to illuminate the true meaning of the present. As the self matures, it reaches further and further back into the past for experience, while its wisdom forecasts seek to penetrate deeper and deeper into the unknown future. And as the conceiving self extends this reach ever further into both past and future, so does judgment become less and less dependent on the momentary present. [UB 118:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_5)

> To become mature is to live more intensely in the present, at the same time escaping from the limitations of the present. The plans of maturity, founded on past experience, are coming into being in the present is such manner as to enhance the values of the future. [UB 118:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_7)

> The time unit of maturity is proportioned so to reveal the co-ordinate relationship of past-present-future that the salt begins to gain insight into the wholeness of events, begins to view the landscape of time from the panoramic perspective of broadened horizons, begins perhaps to suspect the nonbeginning, nonending eternal continuum, the fragments of which are called time. [UB 118:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_8)

## Meaning

> Meaning is something which experience adds to value; it is the appreciative consciousness of values. An isolated and purely selfish pleasure may connote a virtual devaluation of meanings, a meaningless enjoyment bordering on relative evil. [UB 100:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_4)

> Meanings are derived from a combination of recognition and understanding. Meanings are nonexistent in a wholly sensory or material world. Meanings and values are only perceived in the inner or supermaterial spheres of human experience. [UB 111:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_2)

## Meekness

> Genuine meekness has no relation to fear. It is rather an attitude of man co-operating with God—“Your will be done.” It embraces patience and forbearance and is motivated by an unshakable faith in a lawful and friendly universe. It masters all temptations to rebel against the divine leading. Jesus was the ideal meek man of Urantia, and he inherited a vast universe. [UB 140:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_11)

## Mercy

> Mercy is simply justice tempered by that wisdom which grows out of perfection of knowledge and the full recognition of the natural weaknesses and environmental handicaps of finite creatures. [UB 2:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_1)

> Mercy is the natural and inevitable offspring of goodness and love. The good nature of a loving Father could not possibly withhold the wise ministry of mercy to each member of every group of his universe children. Eternal justice and divine mercy together constitute what is human experience would be called fairness.

> Divine mercy represents a, fairness technique, of adjustment between the universe levels of perfection and imperfection. Mercy is not a contravention of justice but rather an understanding interpretation of the demands of supreme justice as it is fairly applied to the subordinate spiritual beings and to the material creatures of the evolving universes. [UB 2:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_4)

> Justice is the collective thought of righteousness; mercy is its personal expression. Mercy is the attitude of love. [UB 10:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_18)

> The Memory of Mercy is a living trial balance, a current statement of your account with the supernatural forces of the realms. [UB 28:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_6)

> The Memory of Mercy must show that the saving credit established by the Sons of God has been fully and faithfully paid out in the loving ministry of the patient personalities of the Third Source and Center. But when mercy is exhausted, when the “memory” thereof testifies to its depletion, then does justice prevail and righteousness decree. For mercy is not to be thrust upon those who despise it; mercy is not a gift to be trampled underfoot by the persistent rebels of time. Nevertheless, though mercy is thus precious and dearly bestowed, your individual drawing credits are always far in excess of your ability to exhaust the reserve if you are sincere of purpose and honest of heart. [UB 28:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_7)

> You should realize that there is a great reward of personal satisfaction in being first just. next fair, then patient, then kind. And then, on that foundation, if you choose, and have it in your heart, you can take the next step and really show mercy; but you cannot exhibit mercy in and of itself. These steps must be traversed; otherwise there can be no genuine mercy. There may be patronage, condescension, or charity—even pity—but not mercy. True mercy comes only as the beautiful climax to these preceding adjuncts to group understanding, mutual appreciation, fraternal fellowship, spiritual communion, and divine harmony. [UB 28:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_8)

> _“Happy are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.”_ Mercy here denotes the height and depth and breadth of the truest friendship—loving-kindness. Mercy sometimes may be passive, but here it is active and dynamic—supreme fatherliness. [UB 140:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_17)

> The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom. [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

## Metaphysics

> But many mortals have recognized the desirability of having some method of reconciling the interplay between the widely separated domains of science and religion; and metaphysics is the result of man’s unavailing attempt to span this well-recognized chasm. But human metaphysics has proved more confusing than illuminating. Metaphysics stands for man’s well-meant but futile effort to compensate for the absence of the mota of morontia. [UB 103:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_7)

> Always, in the absence of revelation or in the failure to accept or grasp it, has mortal man resorted to his futile gesture of metaphysics, that being the only human substitute for the revelation of truth or for the mota of morontia personality. [UB 103:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_8)

## Midsoniters

> The progeny of a Melchizedek life carrier and a Material Daughter are known as midsoniters. [UB 36:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p4_2)

## Militarism

> Militarism is autocratic and cruel—savage. It promotes social organization among the conquerors but disintegrates the vanquished.

> Do not make the mistake of glorifying war; rather discern what it has done for society so that you may the more accurately visualize what its substitutes must provide in order to continue the advancement of civilization. And if such adequate substitutes are not provided, then you may be sure that war will long continue. [UB 70:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_18)

## Mile

> The standard mile of Jerusem is equivalent to about seven Urantia miles. [UB 46:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_2)

## Milky Way

> The densest plane of the superuniverse, the Milky Way, which is also the densest plane of the outer universes. [UB 42:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p5_5)

## Mind

> Any and all that responds to the mind circuit of the Conjoint Actor, we call mind, mind as an attribute of the Infinite Spirit—mind in all its phases. [UB 0:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_1)

> Mind is a phenomenon connoting the presence-activity of living ministry in addition to varied energy systems; and this is true on all levels of intelligence. In personality, mind ever intervenes between spirit and matter; therefore is the universe illuminated by three kinds of light; material light, intellectual insight, and spirit luminosity. [UB 0:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_8)

> Mind; The thinking, perceiving, and feeling mechanism of the human organism. The total conscious and unconscious experience. The intelligence associated with the emotional life reaching upward through worship and wisdom to the spirit level. [UB 0:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_8)

> Mind transmutes the values of spirit into the meanings of intellect; volition has power to bring the meanings of mind to fruit in both the material and spiritual domains. The Paradise ascent involves a relative and differential growth in spirit, mind, and energy. The personality is the unifier of these components of experiential individuality. [UB 9:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p4_6)

> Mind, on Urantia, is a compromise between the essence of thought -perfection and the evolving mentality of your immature human nature. Mind is truly of divine origin, and it does have a divine destiny, but your mortal minds are not yet of divine dignity. [UB 9:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p5_6)

> Mind is the technique whereby spirit realities become experiential to creature personalities. And in the last analysis the unifying possibilities of even human mind, the ability to co-ordinate things, ideas, and values, is supermaterial. [UB 12:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p8_8)

> Mind is a divinity bestowal, but it is not immortal when it functions without spirit insight, and when it is devoid of the ability to worship and crave survival. [UB 36:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_17)

> Material mind is the arena in which human personalities live, are self conscious, make decisions, choose God or forsake him, eternalize or destroy themselves. Material evolution has provided you a life machine, your body; the Father himself has endowed you with the purest spirit reality known in the universe, your Thought Adjuster. But into your hands, subject to your own decisions, has been given mind, and it is by mind that you live or die. It is within this mind and with this mind that you make those moral decisions which enable you to achieve Adjusterlikeness, and that is Godlikeness.

> Mortal mind is a temporary intellect system loaned to human beings for use during a material lifetime, and as they use this mind, they are either accenting or rejecting the potential of eternal existence. Mind is about all you have of universe reality that is subject to your will, and the soul—the morontia self—will faithfully portray the harvest of the temporal decisions which the mortal self is making. [UB 111:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_3)

> Mind is the cosmic instrument on which the human will can play the discords of destruction, or upon which this same human will can bring forth the exquisite melodies of God identification and consequent eternal survival. [UB 111:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_6)

> The material mind of mortal man is the cosmic loom that carries the morontia fabrics on which the indwelling Thought Adjuster threads the spirit patterns of a universe character of enduring values and divine meanings—a surviving soul of ultimate destiny and unending career, a potential finaliter. [UB 111:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_2)

> While the mind is not the seat of the spiritual nature, it is indeed the gateway thereto. [UB 155:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_13)

**Mind. Cosmic**

> _The cosmic mind._ This is the sevenfold diversified mind of time and space, one phase of which is ministered by each of the Seven Master Spirits to one of the seven superuniverses. The cosmic mind encompasses all finite-mind levels and co-ordinates experientially with the evolutionary-deity levels of the Supreme Mind and Transcendentally with the existential levels of absolute mind—the direct circuits of the Conjoint Actor. [UB 42:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_6)

## Minor Sector

> _The Minor Sector._ One hundred local universes (about 1,000,000,000 inhabitable planets) constitute a minor sector of the super universe government; it has a wonderful headquarters world, wherefrom its rulers, the Recents of Days, administer the affairs of the minor sector. There are three Recents of Days, Supreme Trinity Personalities, on each minor sector headquarters. [UB 15:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_6)

## Monogamy

> Polygamy is the survival of the female-slavery element in marriage. Monogamy is the slave-free ideal of the matchless association of one man and one woman in the exquisite enterprise of home building, offspring rearing, mutual culture, and self improvement. [UB 69:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_7)

> Monogamy always has been, now is, and forever will be the idealistic goal of human sex evolution. This ideal of true pair marriage entails self-denial, and therefore does it so often fail just because one or both of the contracting parties are deficient in that acme of all human virtues, rugged self-control. [UB 83:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p6_6)

## Monota

> Monota. Energy is close of kin to divinity when it is Paradise energy. We incline to the belief that monota is the living, nonspirit energy of Paradise—an eternity counterpart of the living, spirit energy of the Original Son—hence the nonspiritual energy system of the Universal Father. [UB 42:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_19)

## Morality

> Morality can never be advanced by law or by force. It is a personal and freewill matter and must be disseminated by the contagion of the contact of morally fragrant persons with those who are less morally responsive, but who are also desirous of doing the Father’s will.

> Moral acts are those human performances which are characterized by the highest intelligence, directed by selective discrimination in the choice of superior ends as well as in the selection of moral means to attain these ends. Such conduct is virtuous. Supreme virtue, then, is wholeheartedly to choose to do the will of the Father in heaven. [UB 16:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_9)

> Morality is the essential pre-existent soil of personal God-consciousness, the personal realization of the Adjuster’s inner presence, but such morality is not the source of religious experience and the resultant spiritual insight. The moral nature is superanimal but subspiritual. Morality is equivalent to the recognition of duty, the realization of the existence of right and wrong. The moral zone intervenes between the animal and the human types of mind as morontia functions between the material and the spiritual spheres of personality attainment.

> The evolutionary mind is able to discover law, morals, and ethics; but -the bestowed spirit, the indwelling Adjuster, reveals to the evolving human mind the lawgiver, the Fathersource of all that is true, beautiful, and good; and such an illuminated man has a religion and is spiritually equipped to begin the long and adventurous search for God.

> Morality is not necessarily spiritual; it may be wholly and purely human, albeit real religion enhances all moral values, makes them more meaningful. Morality without religion fails to reveal ultimate goodness, and it also fails to provide for the survival of even its own moral values. Religion provides for the enhancement, glorification, and assured survival of every thing morality recognizes and approves. [UB 196:3.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_25)

## Morontia

 > _Morontia_ is a term designating a vast level intervening between the material and the spiritual. It may designate personal or Impersonal realities, living or nonliving energies. The warp of morontia is spiritual; its woof is physical. [UB 0:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_12)

**Mortal, God-conscious**

> The God-conscious mortal is certain of salvation; he is unafraid of life; he is honest and consistent. He knows how bravely to endure unavoidable suffering; he is uncomplaining when faced by inescapable hardship. [UB 156:5.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_20)

> The true believer does not grow weary in well-doing just because he is thwarted. Difficulty whets the ardor of the truth lover, while obstacles only challenge the exertions of the undaunted kingdom builder.

## Mota

> Mota - morontia wisdom. [UB 45:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_6)

> Mota is more than a superior philosophy; it is to philosophy as two eyes are to one; it has a stereoscopic effect on meanings and values. Material man sees the universe, as it were, with but one eye—flat. Mansion world students achieve cosmic perspective—depth—by superimposing the perceptions of the morontia life upon the perceptions of the physical life,. [UB 48:6.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_28)

> Reason is the understanding technique of the sciences; faith is the insight technique of religion; mota is the technique of the morontia level. Mota is a supermaterial reality sensitivity which is beginning to compensate incomplete growth, having for its substance knowledge-reason and for its essence faith-insight. Mota is a super-philosophical reconciliation of divergent reality perception which is nonattainable by material personalities; it is predicated, in part, on the experience of having survived the material life of the flesh. But many mortals have recognized the desirability of having some method of reconciling the interplay between the widely separated domains of science and religion; and metaphysics is the result of man’s unavailing attempt to span this well-recognized chasm. But human metaphysics has proved more confusing than illuminating. Metaphysics stands for man’s well-meant but futile effort to compensate for the absence of the mota of morontia. [UB 103:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_7)

> Revelation is evolutionary man’s only hope of bridging the morontia gulf. Faith and reason, unaided by mota, cannot conceive and construct a logical universe. Without the insight of mota, mortal man cannot discern goodness, love, and truth in the phenomena of the material world. [UB 103:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_13)

## Mysticism

> Religion is evolutionary man’s supreme endowment, the one thing which enables him to carry on and “endure as seeing Him who is invisible.” Mysticism, however, is often something of a retreat from life which is embraced by those humans who do not relish the more robust activities of living a religious life in the open arenas of human society and commerce. True religion must act. [UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8)
