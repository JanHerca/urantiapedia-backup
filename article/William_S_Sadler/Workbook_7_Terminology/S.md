## Savior

> Though it is hardly proper to speak of Jesus as a sacrificer, a ransomer, or a redeemer, it is wholly correct to refer to him as a _savior_. He forever made the way of salvation (survival) more clear and certain; he did better and more surely show the way of salvation for all the mortals of all the worlds of Nebadon. [UB 188:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_7)

## Science

> Science is man’s attempted study of his physical environment, the world of energy-matter. [UB 103:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_9)

> Science is man’s effort to solve the apparent riddles of the material universe. [UB 196:3.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_30)

## Scriptures

> These writings are the work of men, some of them holy men, others not so holy. The teachings of these books represent the views and extent of enlightenment of the times in which they had their origin. As a revelation of truth, the last are more dependable than the first.The Scriptures are faulty and altogether human in origin, but mistake not, they do constitute the best collection of religious wisdom and spiritual truth to be found in all the world at this time.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_3)

> Many of these books were not written by the persons whose names they bear, but that in no way detracts from the value of the truths which they contain. [UB 159:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_3)

> The Scriptures are sacred because they present the thoughts and acts of men who were searching for God, and who in these writings left of record their highest concepts of righteousness, truth, and holiness. The Scriptures contain much that is true, very much, but in the light of your present teaching, you know that these writings also contain much that is misrepresentative of the Father in heaven, the loving God I have come to reveal to all the worlds. [UB 159:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_4)

> Nathaniel, never permit yourself for one moment to believe the Scripture records which tell you that the God of love directed your forefathers to go forth in battle to slay all their enemies—men, woman, and children. Such records are the words of men, not very holy men, and they are not the word of God. The Scriptures always have, and always will, reflect the intellectual, moral, and spiritual status of those who create them. [UB 159:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_5)

> Nathaniel, never forget, the Father does not limit the revelation of truth to any one generation or to any one people. Many earnest seekers after the truth have been, and will continue to be, confused and disheartened by these doctrines of the perfection of the Scriptures. [UB 159:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_6)

> Mark you well my words, Nathaniel, nothing which human nature has touched can be regarded as infallible. Through the mind of man divine truth may indeed shine forth, but always of relative purity and partial divinity. The creature may crave infallibility, but only the Creators possess it. [UB 159:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_8)

> But the greatest error of the teaching about the Scriptures is the doctrine of their being sealed books of mystery and wisdom which only the wise minds of the nation dare to interpret. [UB 159:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_9)

> The fear of the authority of the sacred writings of the past effectively prevents the honest souls of today from accepting the new light of the gospel, the light which these very God-knowing men of another generation so intensely longed to see. [UB 159:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_9)

## Rule, golden

> But the highest realization and the truest interpretation of the golden rule consists in the consciousness of the spirit of the truth of the enduring and living reality of such a divine declaration. The true cosmic meaning of this rule of universal relationship is revealed only in its spiritual realization, in the interpretation of the law of conduct by the spirit of the Son to the spirit of the Father that indwells the soul of mortal man. And when such spirit-led mortals realize the true meaning of this golden rule, they are filled to overflowing with the assurance of citizenship in a friendly universe, and their ideals of spirit reality are satisfied only when they love their fellows as Jesus loved us all, and that is the reality of the realization of the love of God. [UB 180:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_8)

## Sadducees

> The Sadducees consisted of the priesthood and certain wealthy Jews. They were not such sticklers for the details of law enforcement. The Pharisees and Sadducees were really religious parties, rather than sects. [UB 137:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p7_7)

## Salvation

> True salvation is the technique of the divine evolution of the mortal mind from matter identification through the realms of morontia liaison to the high universe status of spiritual correlation. [UB 103:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_2)

> The saving or losing of a soul has to do with whether or not the moral consciousness attains survival status through eternal alliance with its associated immortal spirit endowment. Salvation is the spiritualization of the self-realization of the moral consciousness, which thereby becomes possessed of survival value. All forms of soul conflict consist in the lack of harmony between the moral, or spiritual, self-consciousness and the purely intellectual self-consciousness. [UB 133:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p6_6)

> Salvation is the gift of the Father and is revealed by his Sons. Acceptance by faith on your part makes you a partaker of the divine nature, a son or a daughter of God. By faith you are justified; by faith are you saved; and by this same faith are you eternally advanced in the way of progressive and divine perfection. [UB 150:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p5_3)

> You cannot buy salvation; you cannot earn righteousness. Salvation is the gift of God, and righteousness is the natural fruit of the spirit-born life of sonship in the kingdom. You are not to be saved because you live a righteous life; rather is it that you live a righteous life because you have already been saved, have recognized sonship as the gift of God and service in the kingdom as the supreme delight of life on earth. When men believe this gospel, which is a revelation of the goodness of God, they will be led to voluntary repentance of all known sin. Realization of sonship is incompatible with the desire to sin. Kingdom believers hunger for righteousness and thirst for divine perfection. [UB 150:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p5_5)

> It is your faith that saves your souls. Salvation is the gift of God to all who believe they are his sons. But be not deceived; while salvation is the free gift of God and is bestowed upon all who accept it by faith, there follows the experience of bearing the fruits of this spirit life as it is lived in the flesh. [UB 193:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p1_2)

> All this concept of atonement and sacrificial salvation is rooted and grounded in selfishness. Jesus taught that _service_ to one’s fellows is the highest concept of the brotherhood of spirit believers. Salvation should be taken for granted by those who believe in the fatherhood of God. The believer’s chief concern should not be the selfish desire for personal salvation but rather the unselfish urge to love and, therefore, serve one’s fellows even as Jesus loved and served mortal men.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_9)

> Neither do genuine believers trouble themselves so much about the future punishment of sin. The real believer is only concerned about present separation from God. True, wise fathers may chasten their sons, but they do all this in love and for corrective purposes. They do not punish in anger, neither do they chastise in retribution.

> Even if God were the stern and legal monarch of a universe in which justice ruled supreme, he certainly would not be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender.

> The great thing about the death of Jesus, as it is related to the enrichment of human experience and the enlargement of the way of salvation, is not the fact of his death but rather the superb manner and the matchless spirit in which he met death.

> This entire idea of the ransom of the atonement places salvation upon a plane of unreality; such a concept is purely philosophic. Human salvation is real; it is based on two realities which may be grasped by the creature’s faith and thereby become incorporated into individual human experience; the fact of the fatherhood of God and its correlated truth, the brotherhood of man. It is true, after all, that you are to be “forgiven your debts, even as you forgive your debtors.” [UB 188:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_9)

## Sectarianism

> Sectarianism is a disease of institutional religion, and dogmatism is an enslavement of the spiritual nature [UB 99:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_1)

## Security

> Society’s prime gift to man is security. [UB 70:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p9_1)

## Segregata

_Pregravity Stages ( Force)_ . This is the first step in the individuation of space potency into the pre-energy forms of cosmic force. This state is analogous to the concept of the primordial force-charge of space, sometimes called _pure energy_, or _segregata_. [UB 11:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_5)

> Primordial force is sometimes spoken of as _pure energy_; on Uversa we refer to it as SEGREGATA. [UB 42:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_9)

## Self-Consciousness

> Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. [UB 16:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_6)

## Self-control

> That acme of all human virtues, rugged self-control. [UB 83:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p6_6)

## Selfishness

> Unbridled self-will and unregulated self-expression equal unmitigated selfishness, the acme of ungodliness [UB 54:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_5)

## Sensitivity, Ethic

> Through the realization of truth the appreciation of beauty leads to the sense of the eternal fitness of those things which impinge upon the recognition of divine goodness in Deity relations with all beings; and thus even cosmology leads to the pursuit of divine reality values—to God-consciousness. [UB 56:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_8)

## Seraphim

> These attending seraphim have functioned as the spiritual helpers of mortal man in all the great events of the past and the present. In many a revelation “the word was spoken by angels”, many of the mandates of heaven have been “received by the ministry of angels.” Seraphim are the traditional angels of heaven; they are the ministering spirits who live so near you and do so much for you. They have ministered on Urantia since the earliest times of human intelligence. [UB 113:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p0_1)

## Service

> Jesus taught that _service_ to one’s fellows is the highest concept of the brotherhood of spirit believers. [UB188:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_9)

## Sin

> There are many ways of looking at sin, but from the universe philosophic viewpoint sin is the attitude of a personality who is knowingly resisting cosmic reality. [UB 67:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_4)

> Sin being an attitude of the person toward reality, is destined to exhibit its inherent negativistic harvest upon any and all related levels of universe values. [UB 67:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_4)

> Sin is fraught with fatal consequences to personality survival only when it is the attitude of the whole being, when it stands for the choosing of the mind and the willing of the soul. [UB 67:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_4)

> No person is ever made to suffer vital spiritual deprivation because of the sin of another. Sin is wholly personal as to moral guilt or spiritual consequences, notwithstanding its far-flung repercussions in administrative, intellectual, and social domains. [UB 67:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_7)

_Sin must be redefined as deliberate disloyalty to Deity._ There are degrees of disloyalty: the partial loyalty of indecisions the divided loyalty of confliction; the dying loyalty of indifference: and the death of loyalty exhibited in devotion to godless ideals.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p10_2)

> The sense or feeling of guilt is the consciousness of the violation of the mores; it is not necessarily sin. There is no real sin in the absence of conscious disloyalty to Deity. [UB 89:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p10_2)

> Sin is the conscious, knowing, and deliberate transgression of the divine law, the Father’s will; Sin is the measure of unwillingness to be divinely led and spiritually directed. [UB 148:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p4_4)

> Jesus taught that sin is not the child of a defective nature but rather the offspring of a knowing mind dominated’ by an unsubmissive will. Regarding sin, he taught that God has forgiven; that we make such forgiveness personally available by the act of forgiving our fellows. When you forgive your brother in the flesh, you thereby create the capacity in your own soul for the reception of the reality of God’s forgiveness of your own misdeeds. [UB 170:2.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_23)

> The animal nature—the tendency toward evildoing—may be hereditary, but sin is not transmitted from parent to child. Sin is the act of conscious and deliberate rebellion against the Father’s will and the Sons’ laws by an individual will creature. [UB 188:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_5)

## Skill

> Ability is that which you inherit, while skill is what you acquire. Life is not real to one who cannot do some one thing well, expertly. Skill is one of the real sources of the satisfaction of living. [UB 160:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_11)

## Society

> Society is the offspring of age upon age of trial and error; it is what survived the selective adjustments and readjustments in the successive stages of mankind’s agelong rise from animal to human levels of planetary status. The great danger to any civilization-at any one moment-is the threat of breakdown during the time of transition from the established methods of the past to those new and better, but untried procedures of the future. [UB 81:6.41](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_41)

## Sonship

> In all praying, remember that sonship is a _gift_. No child has aught to do with _earning_ the status of son or daughter. The earth child comes into being by the will of its parents. Even so, the child, of God comes into grace and the new life of the spirit by the will of the Father in heaven. Therefore must the Kingdom of heaven—divine sonship be. received as by a little child. You earn righteousness—progressive character development—but you receive sonship by grace and through faith. [UB 144:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_3)

## Soul

> The soul of man is an experiential acquirement. As a mortal creature chooses to “do the will of the Father in heaven,” so the indwelling spirit becomes the father of a _new reality_ in human experience. The mortal and material mind is the mother of this same emerging reality. The substance of this new reality is neither material nor spiritual—it is _morontial_. This is the emerging and immortal soul which is destined to survive mortal death and begin the paradise ascension. [UB 0:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_10)

> The human personality is identified with mind and spirit held together in functional relationship by life in a material body. This functioning relationship of such mind and spirit does not result in some combination of the qualities or attributes of mind and spirit but rather in an entirely new, original, and unique universe value of potentially eternal endurance, the _soul_. [UB 111:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_3)

> The soul is the self-reflective, truth-discerning, and spirit-perceiving part of man which forever elevates the human being above the level of the animal world. Self-consciousness, in and of itself, is not the soul. Moral self-consciousness is true human self-realization and constitutes the foundation of the human soul, and the soul is that part of man which represents the potential survival value of human experience. Moral choice and spiritual attainment, the ability to know God and the urge to be like him, are the characteristics of the soul. The soul of man cannot exist apart from moral thinking and spiritual activity. A stagnant soul is a dying soul. But the soul of man is distinct from the divine spirit which dwells within the mind. The divine spirit arrives simultaneously with the first moral activity of the human mind, and that is the occasion of the birth of the soul. [UB 133:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p6_5)

> The morontia soul of an evolving mortal is really the son of the Adjuster action of the Universal Father and the child of the cosmic reaction of the Supreme Being, the Universal Mother. [UB 117:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_5)

## Space

> Space is, from the human viewpoint, nothing—negative; it exists only as related to something positive and nonspatial. Space is, however, real. It contains and conditions motion. It even moves. [UB 12:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_7)

> Only by ubiquity could Deity unify time-space manifestations to the finite conception, for time is a succession of instants while space is a system of associated points. You do after all, perceive time by analysis and space by synthesis. [UB 118:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_1)

> Space comes the nearest of all nonabsolute things to being absolute. Space is apparently absolutely ultimate. The real difficulty we have in understanding space on the material level is due to the fact that, while material bodies exist in space, space also exists in these same material bodies. While there is much about space that is absolute, that does not mean that space is absolute. [UB 118:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_5)

> Mankind is slow to perceive that, in all that is personal, matter is the skeleton of morontia, and that both are the reflected shadow of enduring spirit reality. How long before you will regard time as the moving image of eternity and space as the fleeting shadow of Paradise realities? [UB 189:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_3)

## Space Potency

> Space potency is a prereality; it is the domain of the Unqualified Absolute and is responsive only to the personal grasp of the Universal Father, notwithstanding that it is seemingly modifiable by the presence of the Primary Master Force organizers.

> On Uversa, space potency is spoken of as ABSOLUTA. [UB 42:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_5)

## Spirit

> Spirit is ever conscious, minded, and possessed of varied phases of identity. Without mind in some phase there would be no spiritual consciousness in the fraternity of spirit beings. [UB 6:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p6_2)

_Spirit._ The divine spirit that indwells the mind of man—the Thought Adjuster. This immortal spirit is prepersonal—not a personality, though destined to become a part of the personality of the surviving mortal creature. [UB 0:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_9)

> Cosmic force responds to mind even as cosmic mind responds to spirit. Spirit is divine purpose, and spirit mind is divine purpose in action. Energy is thing, mind .is meaning, spirit is value. Even in time and space, mind establishes those relative relationships between energy and spirit which are suggestive of mutual kinship in eternity. [UB 9:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p4_5)

> The goal of existence of all personalities is spirit. [UB 12:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p8_13)

## Spirit of God

> In your sacred writings the term _Spirit of God_ seems to be used interchangeably to designate both the infinite Spirit on Paradise and the Creative Spirit of your local universe. The Holy Spirit is the spiritual circuit of this Creative Daughter of the Paradise Infinite Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a circuit indigenous to each local universe and is confined to the spiritual realm of that creation: but the Infinite Spirit is omnipresent. [UB 8:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p5_3)

## Spiritual reason

> Faith-insight, or spiritual intuition, is the endowment of the cosmic mind in association with the Thought Adjuster, which is the Father’s gift to man. Spiritual reason, soul intelligence, is the endowment of the Holy Spirit, the Creative Spirit’s gift to man. Spiritual philosophy, the wisdom of spirit realities, is the endowment of the Spirit of Truth, the combined gift of the bestowal Sons to the children of men. And the co-ordination and interassociation of these spirit endowments constitute man. a spirit personality in potential destiny. [UB 101:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_2)

## Spirituality

> Spirituality becomes at once the indicator of one’s nearness to God and the measure of one’s usefulness to fellow beings. Spirituality enhances the ability to discover beauty in things, recognize truth in meanings, and discover goodness in values. Spiritual development is determined by capacity therefor and is directly proportional to the elimination of the selfish qualities of love. [UB 100:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_4)

## Spironga

> The _Spironga_ are the spirit offspring of the Bright and Morning Star and the Father Melchizedek. They are exempt from personality termination but are not evolutionary or ascending beings. Neither are they functionally concerned with the evolutionary ascension regime. They are the spirit helpers of the local universe, executing the routine spirit tasks of Nebadon. [UB 37:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p10_2)

## Spornagia

> The architectural headquarters worlds of the local universe are real worlds—physical creations. There is much work connected with their physical upkeep, and herein we have the assistance of a group of physical creatures called spornagia. They are devoted to the care and culture of the material phases of these headquarters worlds, from Jerusem to Salvington. Spornagia are neither spirits not persons; they are an animal order of existence, but if you could see them, you would agree that they seem to be perfect animals. [UB 37:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p10_3)

> Spornagia are not Adjuster indwelt. They do not possess survival souls, but they do enjoy long lives, sometimes to the extent of forty to fifty thousand standard years. Their number is legion, and they afford physical ministry to all orders of universe personalities requiring material service. Although spornagia neither possess nor evolve survival souls, though they do not have personality, nevertheless, they do evolve an individuality which can experience reincarnation. When, with the passing of time, the physical bodies of these unique creatures deteriorate from usage and age, their creators in collaboration with the Life Carters, fabricate new bodies in which the old spornagia re-establish their residences.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_3)

> Spornagia are the only creatures in all the universe of Nebadon who experience this or any other sort of reincarnation. [UB 46:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_3)

> Perhaps I can best suggest to Urantia minds something of the nature of these beautiful and serviceable creatures by saying that they embrace the combined traits of a faithful horse and an affectionate dog and manifest an intelligence exceeding that of the highest type of chimpanzee. [UB 46:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_7)

## Subabsolute Inevitability

> We have come to speak of the threefold personalization of Deity as the _absolute inevitability_, while we have come to look upon the appearance of the Seven Master Spirits as the _subabsolute inevitability_. [UB 16:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_1)

## Subpersonal

> Man also observes mind phenomena in living organisms functioning on the subpersonal (animal) level. [UB 6:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p6_1)

## Superuniverse

> Ten major sectors (about 1,000,000,000 inhabited worlds) make one major sector. Each major sector is provided with an enormous and glorious headquarters world and is ruled by three Ancients of Days. [UB 15:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_8)

## Supreme Being

_The Supreme Being_ is not a direct creator, except that he is the father of Majeston, but he is a synthetic co-ordinator of all creature-Creator universe activities. The Supreme Being, now actualizing in the evolutionary universes, is the Deity correlator and synthesizer of time-space divinity, of triune Paradise Deity in experiential association with the Supreme Creators of time and space. [UB 0:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p7_9)

## Survival

> The survival of mortal creatures is wholly predicated on the evolvement of an immortal soul within the mortal mind [UB 36:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_5)

> Eternal survival can be jeopardized only by the decisions of the mind and the choice of the soul of the individual himself. [UB 67:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_5)

> Human survival is in great measure dependent on consecrating the human will to the choosing of those values selected by this spirit-value sorter—the indwelling interpreter and unifier. [UB 196:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_17)

## Suspicion

> Suspicion is the inherent reaction of primitive men; the survival struggles of the early ages do not naturally breed trust. [UB 39:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_7)

## System

> The basic unit of the supergovernment consists of about one thousand inhabited or inhabitable worlds. Blazing suns, cold worlds, planets too near the hot suns, and other spheres not suitable for creature habitation are not included in this group. These one thousand worlds adapted to support life are called a system, but in the younger systems only a comparatively small number of these worlds may be inhabited. Each inhabited planet is presided over by a Planetary Prince, and each local system has an architectural sphere as its headquarters and is ruled by a System Sovereign. [UB 15:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_3)
