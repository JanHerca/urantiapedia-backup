## I AM

> The concept of the I AM Is a philosophic concession which we make to the time-bound, space-fettered, finite mind of man, to the impossibility of creature comprehension of eternity existences—nonbeginning, nonending realities and relationships. To the time-space creature, all things must have a beginning save only the ONE UNCAUSED—the primal cause of causes. Therefor do we conceptualize this philosophic value-level as the I AM, at the same time instructing all creatures that the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit are coeternal with the I AM; in other words, that there never was a time when the I AM was not the Father of the Son and, with him, of the Spirit. [UB 0:3.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_23)

## Idea

> An idea is only a theoretical plan for action, while a positive decision is a validated plan of action. [UB 101:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_1)

## Idealism

> The approaching concept of the divine. [UB 3:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_11)

## Image of God

> The “image of God” does not refer to physical likeness nor to the circumscribed limitations of material creature endowment but rather to the gift of the spirit presence of the Universal Father in the supernal bestowal of the thought adjusters upon the humble creatures of the universes. [UB 108:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_3)

## Immaturity

> Your inability or unwillingness to forgive your fellows is the measure of your immaturity, your failure to attain adult sympathy, understanding,and love. (also see maturity) [UB 174:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_5)

## Impatience

> Impatience is a spirit poison; anger is like a stone hurled into a hornet’s nest. [UB 48:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_20)

## Iniquity

> There are many ways of looking at sin, but from the universe philosophic viewpoint sin is the attitude of a personality who is knowingly resisting cosmic reality. Error might be regarded as a misconception or distortion of reality. Evil is a partial realization of, or maladjustment to, universe realities. But sin is a purposeful resistance to divine reality—a conscious choosing to oppose spiritual progress—while iniquity consists in an open and persistent defiance of recognized reality and signifies such a degree of personality disintegration as to border on cosmic insanity. [UB 67:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_4)

> Error suggests lack of intellectual keenness; evil, deficiency of wisdom; sin, abject spiritual poverty; but iniquity is indicative of vanishing personality control.. And when sin has so many times been chosen and so often been repeated, it may become habitual. Habitual sinners can easily become iniquitous, become wholehearted rebels against the universe and all of its divine realities. While all manner of sins may be forgiven, we doubt whether the established iniquiter would ever sincerely experience sorrow for his misdeeds or accept forgiveness for his sins. [UB 67:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_5)

> Iniquity is the willful, determined, and , the Father’s will. Iniquity is the measure of the continued rejection of the Father’s loving plan of personality survival and the Sons’ merciful ministry of salvation. [UB 148:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p4_5)

## Insight,cosmic

> The grasp of universe meanings. [UB 16:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_12)

## Insight, spiritual

> All such inner and spiritual communion is termed spiritual insight. Such religious experiences result from the impress made upon the mind of man by the combined operations of the Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth as they function amid and upon the ideas, ideals, insights, and spirit strivings of the evolving sons of God. [UB 101:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_3)

> The mind of evolutionary man is ever confronted with the intricate problem of refereeing the contest between the natural expansion of emotional impulses and the moral growth of unselfish urges predicated on spiritual insight—genuine religious reflection. [UB 103:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_5)

## Intolerance

> You should never forget that intolerance is the mask covering up the entertainment of secret doubts as to the trueness of one’s belief. No man is at any time disturbed by his neighbor’s attitude when he has perfect confidence in the truth of that which he wholeheartedly believes. Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true convictions and noble ideals. [UB 146:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_2)

## Intuition, moral

> The realization of duty. [UB 16:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_1)
