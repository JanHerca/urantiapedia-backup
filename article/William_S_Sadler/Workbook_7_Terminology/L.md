## Law

> Law is life itself and not the rules of its conduct.Evil is a transgression of law, not a violation of the rules of conduct Pertaining to life, which is the law. Falsehood is not a matter of narration technique, but something premeditated as a perversion of truth. [UB 48:6.33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_33)

> Law is a codified record of long human experience, public opinion crystallized and legalized. [UB 70:11.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p11_6)

## Law of the spirit

> My children, do you not perceive the law of the spirit which decrees that to him who has shall be given so that he shall have an abundance; but from him who has not shall be taken away even that which he has. [UB 151:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p1_4)

## Levels, cosmic

> Perhaps these psychic circles of mortal progression would be better denominated cosmic levels—actual meaning grasps and value realizations of progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of initial relationship of the evolutionary soul with the emerging Supreme Being.And it is this very relationship that makes it forever impossible fully to explain the significance of the cosmic circles to the material mind. These circle attainments are only relatively related to God-consciousness. A seventh circler can be almost as truly God-knowing-sonship conscious-as a second or first circler, but such lower circle beings are far less conscious of experiential relation to the Supreme Being, universe citizenship. The attainment of these cosmic circles will become a part of the ascenders’ experience on the mansion worlds if they fail of such achievement before natural death. [UB 110:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_16)

## Liberty, true and false

> Of all the perplexing problems growing out of the Lucifer rebellion, none has occasioned more difficulty than the failure of immature evolutionary mortals to distinguish between true and false liberty.
> 
> True liberty is the quest of the ages and the reward of of evolutionary progress. False liberty is the subtle deception of the error of time and the evil of space. Enduring liberty is predicated on the reality of justice—intelligence, maturity, fraternity, and equity.Liberty is a self-destroying technique of cosmic existence when its motivation is unintelligent, unconditioned and uncontrolled. True liberty is progressively related to reality and is ever regardful of social equity, cosmic fairness, universe fraternity, and divine obligations. Liberty is suicidal when divorced from material justice, intellectual fairness, social forbearance, moral duty, and spiritual values. Liberty is nonexistent apart from cosmic reality, and all personality reality is proportional to its divinity relationships.Unbridled self-will and unregulated self-expression equal unmitigated selfishness, the acme of ungodliness. Liberty without the associated and ever-increasing conquest of self is a figment of egoistic mortal imagination Self motivated liberty is a conceptual illusion, a cruel deception. License masquerading in the garments of liberty is the forerunner of abject bondage. [UB 54:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_1)

> True liberty is the associate of genuine self-respect; false liberty is the consort of self-admiration. True liberty is the fruit of self-control;false liberty, the assumption of self-assertion. Self control leads to altruistic services self admiration tends towards the exploitation of others for the selfish aggrandizement of such a mistaken individual as is willing to sacrifice righteous attainment for the sake of possessing unjust power over his fellow beings. [UB 54:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_6)

## License

> License masquerading in the garments of liberty is the forerunner of abject bondage. [UB 54:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_5)

## Life

> We speak of life as “energy” and as “force” but it is really neither. Force-energy is variously gravity responsive; life is not. Pattern is also nonresponsive to gravity, being a configuration of energies that have already fulfilled all gravity-responsive obligations. Life, as such, constitutes the animation of some pattern-configured or otherwise segregated system of energy-material, mindal, or spiritual.
> 
> There are some things connected with the elaboration of life on the evolutionary planets which are not altogether clear to us. We fully comprehend the physical organization of the electrochemical formulas of the Life Carriers, but we do not wholly understand the nature and source of the life-activation spark. We know that life flows from the Father through the Son and by the Spirit. [UB 36:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_6)

> To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion And this is just why the God of worship claims all allegiance or none. [UB 102:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_1)

> The material self, the ego-entity of human identity, is dependent during the physical life on the continuing function of the material life vehicle, on the continued existence of the unbalanced equilibrium of energies and intellect which, on Urantia has been given the name life. But selfhood of survival value, selfhood that can transcend the experience of death, is only evolved by establishing a potential transfer of the seat of the identity of the evolving personality from the transient, life vehicle—the material body—to the more enduring and immortal nature of the morontia soul and on beyond to those levels whereon the soul becomes infused with, and eventually attains the status of, spirit reality. This actual transfer from material association to morontia identification is effected by the sincerity, persistence, and steadfastness of the God-seeking decisions of the human creature. [UB 112:2.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_20)

> Life is an adaptation of the original cosmic causation to the demands and possibilities of universe situations, and it comes into being by the action of the Universal Mind and the activation of the spirit spark of the God who is spirit. The meaning of life is its adaptability; the value of life is its progressabillty—even to the heights of God consciousness [UB 130:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_7)

## Life Carrier

> Life does not originate spontaneously. Life is constructed according to plans formulated by the (unrevealed) Architects of Being and appears on the inhabited planets either by direct importation or as a result of the operations of the Life Carriers of the local universes. These carriers of life are among the most interesting and versatile of the diverse family of Universe sons. They are intrusted with designing and carrying creature life to the planetary spheres. And after planting this life on such new worlds, they remain, there for long periods to foster its development. [UB 36:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p0_1)

> Life Carriers are living catalytic presences which agitate, organize, and vitalize the otherwise inert elements of the material order of existence. [UB 36:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p3_5)

## Life, Jesus

> Jesus’ life is the everlasting comfort of all disappointed idealists. [UB 126:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_4)

## Light

> _Light_ - spirit luminosity - is a word symbol, a figure of speech, which connotes the personality manifestation characteristic of spirit beings of diverse orders. This luminous emanation is in no respect related either to intellectual insight or to physical-light manifestations. [UB 0:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_9)

## Logic

> Reason is the method of science; faith is the method of religion; logic is the attempted technique of philosophy. [UB 101:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_2)

> Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience. [UB 101:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_8)

> But logic can never succeed in harmonizing the findings of science and the insights of religion unless both the scientific and the religious aspects of a personality are truth dominated, sincerely desirous of following the truth wherever it may lead regardless of the conclusions which it may reach. Logic is the technique of philosophy, its method of expression. Within the domain of true science, reason is always amenable to genuine logic; within the domain of true religion, faith is always logical from the basis of an inner viewpoint, even though such faith may appear to be quite unfounded from the in-looking viewpoint of the scientific approach. From outward, looking within, the universe may appear to be material; from within, looking out, the same universe appears to be wholly spiritual. Reason grows out of material awareness, faith out of spiritual awareness, but through the mediation of a philosophy strengthened by revelation, logic may confirm both the inward and the outward view, thereby effecting the stabilization of both science and religion. Thus, through common contact with the logic of philosophy, may both science and religion become increasingly tolerant of each other, less and less skeptical. [UB 103:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_5)

> Reason, is the act of recognizing the conclusions of consciousness with regard to the experience in and with the physical world of energy and matter. Faith is the act of recognizing the validity of spiritual consciousness—something which is incapable of other mortal proof. Logic is the synthetic truth-seeking progression of the unity of faith and reason and is founded on the constitutive mind endowments of mortal beings, the innate recognition of things, meanings, and values. [UB 103:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_13)

## Love

> Love is the secret of beneficial association between personalities. [UB 12:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_2)

> This term, even though it does connote man’s highest concept of the mortal relations of respect and devotion, is so frequently designative of so much of human relationship that is wholly ignoble and utterly unfit to be known by any word which is also used to indicate the matchless affection of the living God for his universe creatures! [UB 2:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_11)

> God is love, but love is not God. The greatest manifestation of the divine love for mortal beings is observed in the bestowal of the Thought Adjusters, but your greatest revelation of the Father’s love is seen in the bestowal life of his Son Michael as he lived on earth the ideal spiritual life. It is the indwelling Adjuster who individualizes the love of God to each human soul. [UB 2:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_10)

> Universal beauty is the recognition of the reflection of the Isle of Paradise in the material creation, while eternal truth is the special ministry of the Paradise Sons who not only bestow themselves upon the mortal races but even pour out their Spirit of Truth upon all peoples. Divine goodness is more fully shown forth in the loving ministry of the manifold personalities of the infinite Spirit. But love, the sum total of these three qualities, is man’s perception of God as his spirit Father. [UB 56:10.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_17)

> Love is the desire to do good to others. [UB 56:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_21)

> You can best by discovering their motivation. If some one irritates you, causes feelings of resentment, you should sympathetically seek to discern his viewpoint, his reasons for such objectionable conduct. If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love. [UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4)

> If you could only know your fellows, you would eventually fall in love with them. You cannot truly love your fellows by a mere act of the will. Love is only born of thoroughgoing understanding of your neighbors’ motives and sentiments. It is not so important to love all men today as it is that each day you learn to love one more human being. If each day or week you achieve an understanding of one more of your fellows, and if this is the limit of your ability, then you are certainly socializing and truly spiritualizing your personality. Love is infectious, and when human devotion is intelligent and wise, love is more catching then hate. But only genuine and unselfish love is truly contagious. If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity, to such an extent that all civilization would be encompassed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man. [UB 100:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_5)

> A father’s love need not pamper, and it does not condone evil, but it is always anticynical. Fatherly love has singleness of purpose, and it always looks for the best in man; that is the attitude of a true parent. [UB 140:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_12)

> Fatherly love delights in returning good for evil-going good in retaliation for injustice. [UB 140:5.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_24)

> In the true meaning of the word, love connotes mutual regard of whole personalities. [UB 112:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_7)

> You are destined to live a narrow and mean life if you learn to love only those who love you. Human love may indeed be reciprocal, but divine love is outgoing in all its satisfaction-seeking. The less of love in any creature’s nature, the greater the love need, and the more does divine love seek to satisfy such need. Love is never self-seeking, and it cannot be self-bestowed. Divine love cannot be contained; it must be unselfishly bestowed. [UB 156:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_11)

> Your inability or unwillingness to forgive your fellows is the measure of your immaturity, your failure to attain adult sympathy, understanding, and love. You hold grudges and nurse vengefulness in direct proportion to your ignorance of the inner nature and true longings of your children and your fellow beings. Love is the outworking of the divine and inner urge of life. It is founded on the understanding, nurtured by unselfish service, and perfected in wisdom. [UB 174:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_5)

> Love is truly contagious and eternally creative. Jesus’ death on the cross exemplifies a love which is sufficiently strong and divine to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing. Jesus disclosed to this world a higher quality of righteousness than justice—mere technical right and wrong. Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them. The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom. [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

> True love does not compromise not condone hate; it destroys it. The love of Jesus is never satisfied with mere forgiveness. The Master’s love implies rehabilitation, eternal survival. [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

> Greater love no man can have than this: that he would be willing to lay down his life for his friends. [UB 188:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_7)

> Love is the highest motivation which man may utilize in his universe ascent. But love, divested of truth, beauty, and goodness, is only a sentiment, a philosophic distortion, a psychic illusion, a spiritual deception. Love must always be redefined on successive levels of morontia and spirit progression. [UB 196:3.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_29)

## Loyalty

> Is _loyalty_ - devotion to highest duty - desirable? Then must man carry on amid the possibilities of betrayal and desertion. The valor of devotion to duty consists in the implied danger of default. [UB 3:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_12)

> On the system headquarters the seraphic teachers will further quicken your appreciation of cosmic morality-of the interactions of liberty and loyalty. What is loyalty? it is the fruit of an intelligent appreciation of universe brotherhood; one could not take so much and give nothing. As you ascend the personality scale, first you learn to be loyal, then to love, then to be filial, and then may you be free: but not until you are a finaliter, not until you have attained perfection of loyalty, can you self-realize finality of liberty. [UB 39:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_10)

## Local Universe

> One hundred constellations (about 10,000 inhabitable planets) constitute a local universe. Each local universe has a magnificent architectural headquarters world and is ruled by one of the co-ordinate Creator Sons of God of the order of Michael. Each universe is blessed by the presence of a Union of Days, a representative of the Paradise Trinity. [UB 15:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_5)

## Luck

> Bad luck—nothing for something—Good luck—something for nothing. [UB 86:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p1_3)

> Luck is merely a term coined to cover the inexplicable in any age of human existence; it designates those phenomena which men are unable or unwilling to penetrate. [UB 86:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_5)
