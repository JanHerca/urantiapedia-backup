Author: **William S. Sadler**

## Causation

> The reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination [UB 16:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_6)

## Chance

> Chance is a word which signifies that man is too ignorant or too indolent to determine causes. Men regard a natural occurrence as an accident or as bad luck only when they are destitute of curiosity and imagination, when the races lack initiative and adventure. Exploration of the phenomena of life sooner or later destroys man’s belief in chance, luck, and so called accidents, substituting therefor a universe of law and order wherein all effects are preceded by definite causes. This is the fear of existence replaced by the joy of living. [UB 86:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_5)

## Christianity

> Christianity, as it developed from that day, is: the fact of God as the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, in association with the experience of believer-fellowship with the risen and glorified Christ. [UB 194:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_4)

## Circles, psychic

> Perhaps these psychic circles of mortal progression would be better denominated cosmic levels actual meaning grasps and value realizations of progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of initial relationship of the evolutionary soul with the emerging Supreme Being. And it is this very relationship that makes it forever impossible fully to explain the significance of the cosmic circles to the material mind. These circle attainments are only relatively related to God-consciousness. A seventh or sixth circler can be almost as truly God-knowing—sonship conscious—as a second or first circler, but such lower circle beings are far less conscious of experiential relation to the Supreme Being, universe citizenship. The attainment of these cosmic circles will become a part of the ascenders experience on the mansion worlds if they fail of such achievement before natural death. [UB 110:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_16)

## Conduct

> Proper conduct is essential to progress by way of knowledge, through philosophy, to the spiritual heights of spontaneous worship. All Paradise conduct is wholly spontaneous, in every sense natural and free. But there still is a proper and perfect way of doing things on the eternal Isle, and the directors of conduct are ever by the side of the “strangers within the gates” to instruct them and so guide their steps as to put them at perfect ease and at the same time to enable the pilgrims to avoid that confusion and uncertainty which would otherwise be inevitable. Only by such arrangement could endless confusion be avoided; and confusion never appears on Paradise. [UB 27:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p4_2)

## Confession

> The confession of sin is a manful repudiation of disloyalty, but it in no wise mitigates the time-space consequences of such disloyalty. But confession—sincere recognition of the nature of sin—is essential to religious growth and spiritual progress. [UB 89:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p10_5)

## Conflict

> All conflict is evil in that it inhibits the creative function of the inner life—it is a species of civil war in the personality. [UB 111:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_11)

## Conjoint Actor

> Ever remember that the Infinite Spirit is the _Conjoint_ Actor; both the Father and the Son are functioning in and through him; he is present not only as himself but also as the Father and as the Son and as the Father-Son. In recognition of this and for many additional reasons the spirit presence of the Infinite Spirit is often referred to as “the spirit of God.” [UB 8:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p5_5)

> The Conjoint Actor is the spirit-mind personality, the source of intelligence, reason, and the universal mind. [UB 0:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_5)

## Conscience

> Conscience, untaught by experience and unaided by reason, never has been, and never can be a safe and unerring guide to human conduct. Conscience is not a divine voice speaking to the human soul. It is merely the sum total of the moral and ethical content of the mores of any current stage of existence; It simply represents the humanly conceived ideal of reaction in any given set of circumstances. [UB 92:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_6)

## Constellation

> One hundred systems ( about 100,000 inhabitable planets) make up a constellation. Each constellation has an architectural headquarters sphere and is presided over by three Vorondadek Sons, the Most High. Each constellation also has a Faithful of Days in observation, an ambassador of the Paradise Trinity. [UB 15:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p2_4)

## Cosmic Consciousness

> Cosmic consciousness implies the recognition of a First Cause, the one and only uncaused reality. [UB 0:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_2)

## Counsel

> The social urge, the endowment of species co-operation; the ability of will creatures to harmonize with their fellows; the origin of the gregarious instinct among the more lowly creatures. [UB 36:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_10)

## Courage

> The fidelity endowment—in personal beings, the basis of character acquirement and the intellectual root of moral stamina and spiritual bravery. When enlightened by facts and inspired by truth, this becomes the secret of the urge of evolutionary ascension by the channels of intelligent and conscientious self—direction. [UB 36:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_8)

> Courage—strength of character. [UB 3:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_6)

> Courage is valorous... [UB 111:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_9)

> Courage is the confidence of thoroughgoing honesty about those things which one professes to believe. Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true convictions and noble ideals. [UB 146:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_2)

## Cult

> A symbolism of rituals, slogans, or goals. The cult is the skeletal structure around which grows the living and dynamic body of personal spiritual experience—true religion. [UB 87:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_10)

## Curiosity

> Hunger for harmony and thirst for beauty. Persistent attempts to discover new levels of harmonious cosmic relationships. [UB 56:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_6)
