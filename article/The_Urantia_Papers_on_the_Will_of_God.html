<p>The Urantia Papers on the Will of God?</p>
<p>In the universes God the Father is, in potential, the overcontroller of matter, mind, and spirit. Only by means of his far-flung personality circuit does God deal directly with the personalities of his vast creation of will creatures, but he is contactable (outside of Paradise) only in the presences of his fragmented entities, the will of God abroad in the universes.</p>
<p>Facing the world of personality, God is discovered to be a loving person; facing the spiritual world, he is a personal love; in religious experience he is both. Love identifies the volitional will of God. The goodness of God rests at the bottom of the divine free will-ness–the universal tendency to love, show mercy, manifest patience, and minister forgiveness.</p>
<p>The will of God is divine truth, living love; therefore are the perfecting creations of the evolutionary universes characterized by goodness–nearness to divinity;</p>
<p>Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification. We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself.</p>
<p>Mortals will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. And these qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely, and to live divinely means actually to live the will of God.</p>
<p>Every mortal who is consciously or unconsciously following the leading of the indwelling Spirit of God is living in accordance with the will of God. Consciousness of this Spirit indwelling is consciousness of God’s presence.</p>
<p>The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God–with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike–divine.</p>
<p>Jesus said: The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative. To do the will of God, therefore, is the progressive experience of becoming more and more like God, and God is the source and destiny of all that is good and beautiful and true.</p>
<p>"Fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led–that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness–justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty.</p>
<p>“When God’s will is your law, you are noble slave subjects; but when you believe in this new gospel of divine sonship, my Father’s will becomes your will, and you are elevated to the high position of the free children of God, liberated sons of the kingdom.” (Jesus)</p>
<p>The kingdom of God in this world is the supreme desire to do the will of God, the unselfish love of man which yields the good fruits of improved ethical and moral conduct.</p>
<p>Though we cannot see God, we can know him. And by daily living the will of the Father in heaven, we can reveal him to our fellow men.</p>
<p>In the coming kingdom, be not mindful of those things which foster your anxiety but rather at all times concern yourselves only with doing the will of the Father who is in heaven. (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_6">UB 137:1.6</a>)</p>
<p>The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the “will of the Father in heaven.”</p>
