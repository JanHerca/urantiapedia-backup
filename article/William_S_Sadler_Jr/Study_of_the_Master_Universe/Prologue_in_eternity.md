Author: **William S. Sadler, Jr.**

The master universe is a future-eternal reality. But, excepting Havona, it is not a past-eternal reality. This study of the master creation does not, therefore, properly begin until we are ready to consider Havona in relation to the post-Havona universes. In this Prologue to the study proper, we will accordingly give attention to those eternity acts of Deity which set the stage of space for the master universe – even for Havona, itself.

This Prologue is presented in three parts:

* [FIRST PROLOGUE – Before the Beginning of Beginnings](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_1)
    - We begin with the Infinite
* [SECOND PROLOGUE – The Zero Age](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_2#the-zero-age)
    - [Before the Times of Havona](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_2#before-the-times-of-havona)
    - [An Exploration of Past Eternity](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_2#an-exploration-of-past-eternity)
    - [Existential Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_2#existential-thesis-antithesis-and-synthesis)
* [THIRD PROLOGUE – The First Universe Age](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#the-first-universe-age)
    - [Dawn of Eternity](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#the-dawn-of-eternity-the-beginning-of-the-first-age)
    - [Existential Realities](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#an-inventory-of-existential-eternal-realities)
    - [Existential Trinity](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#the-existential-trinity)
    - [The Uniqueness of Eternal Havona](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#the-uniqueness-of-havona)
    - [Architects of the Master Universe](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Prologue_3#the-architects-of-the-master-universe)

Since we are starting with an exploration of the eternal past, we might just as well do a good job of it and start as far back as imagination can take us.
