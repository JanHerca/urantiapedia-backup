Author: **William S. Sadler, Jr.**

We can begin, but we cannot finish, the last of the three stories of the master universe. The last story starts with the completed master universe, functioning under the experiential rule of God the Ultimate, and attempts to go on from there.

This story, like the first, is presented in three chapters:
- [Chapter X – The Final Creative Thesis](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/10)
- [Chapter XI – Beginning of the Final Antithesis](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/11)
- [Chapter XII – The Impossible Synthesis](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/12)

This story ends on a note of suspense and perplexity. Experiential creative forces and agencies, having exhausted the possibility for growth on the finite and the absonite levels, are finally baffled by the limitlessness of absolute levels of growth and progression. This is the final challenge, the challenge of infinity!
