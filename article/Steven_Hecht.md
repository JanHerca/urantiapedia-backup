## Bio

Steven Hecht lives in Acton, MA with his will Dori Smith. Ever since he found _The Urantia Book_ in 1970, it has been a determining influence in his life. He priers to think of the book's teachings not as a road map but as a musical score, ripe for improvisation and interpretationâ€”just as Jesus' life is not a template to be imitated but a life that inspires one's own.
