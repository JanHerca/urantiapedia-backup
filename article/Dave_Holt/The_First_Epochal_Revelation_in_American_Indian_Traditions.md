> While statements with reference to cosmology are never inspired, such revelations are of immense value in that they at least transiently clarify knowledge by: . . . the restoration of important bits of lost knowledge concerning epochal transactions in the distant past . . . [[UB 101:4.5-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_5)]

It soon becomes evident in our reading that one intention of _The Urantia Book_ is to restore and reconnect the peoples of Earth to their lost history. The book’s authors tell us, “_in formulating [The Urantia Book] we shall in all our efforts to reveal truth,_” have a second purpose, to “_coordinate essential knowledge_” [[UB 0:12.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_11)] One of the ways this coordination is achieved is the presentation of an organized system of five epochal revelations (in order): Dalamatia, the Garden of Eden, Melchizedek, Jesus, and lastly, _The Urantia Book_ itself. Let us also define cosmology as an explanation of the relationship of human beings to the rest of the universe, a story closely tied to religious beliefs. 

How are the “epochal transactions” mentioned above related to this term epochal revelation, also unique to _The Urantia Book_? What is meant, I believe, is that the five events are turning points in history, historical epochs when a new revealed idea is received, one that transforms and uplifts the course of human civilization. The knowledge given in epochal revelations has more significance and power than the revelations of our human prophets. 

Let us focus our attention on Paper 67 where we get a new perspective on an important bit of the “lost knowledge” the book considers “essential.” 

> The problems associated with human existence on Urantia are impossible of understanding without a knowledge of the occurrence and the consequences of the planetary rebellion. [[UB 67:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p0_1)]

I want to examine here the effects of the Lucifer Rebellion on the early human races who received the first epochal revelation given to our primitive planet in the era of the Planetary Prince. The Dalamatia teachings were terminated prematurely by the rebellion. Finally, I will consider how this restored knowledge affects societies, human insights, and moral decisions of today. 

The reign of the Planetary Prince of Urantia began concurrently with the origin of the colored races 500,000 years ago. This is another _Urantia Book_ story missing from our history books and unknown from any other source—the arrival of the Sangik children, the original six colored races: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo. These six races had their origin in the “highlands of western India,” at about the time of the Prince’s arrival. The race that preceded their sudden emergence, the Andonites, already carried melanin as do “_all human beings._” [[UB 63:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_1)] It is derived from an amino acid and produced by skin cells called melanocytes, whereas in the viewpoint expressed in _The Urantia Book_, the tendency to different colors was based on something less generalized and more particular, a latent genetic trait inherent in the human biology of the inhabited worlds. 

> Urantia is the first world in Satania where the six colored races sprang from the same human family. They ordinarily arise in diversified strains from independent mutations within the prehuman animal stock, and usually appear on earth one at a time . . . beginning with the red man…” [[UB 65:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_7)] However, “the simultaneous emergence of all six races on Urantia, and in one family, was most unusual.” [[UB 64:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_1)] 

All of this “lost knowledge” completely differs from the Bible’s version of human origins in [Genesis 3:20](/en/Bible/Genesis/3#v20), where Eve is “the mother of all human beings everywhere.” _The Urantia Book_ account thus seeks to clarify that the first colored races were not the children of Adam and Eve. This is significant for American Indian people who “know” intuitively that their origins are different. The era of the Adamites, Mother Eve’s people, began much later, in 37,000 BCE, following the arrival of the biologic uplifters, Adam and Eve, described in _The Urantia Book_ as a Material Son and Daughter. 

## Early Teachings of the Prince “Before the Fall” 

To regain more knowledge of the rebellion, _The Urantia Book_ leads us back through the deep mists of time until we arrive in Dalamatia, the city of the Planetary Prince. This site became the Dilmun of our ancient history. [[UB 77:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_8)] The “Prince of this world,”[^1] that Jesus referred to in the gospels, is known in _The Urantia Book_ by the name, Caligastia. He is a Lanonandek son, born of the Creator Son and the Universe Mother Spirit. 

This city of the Arabo-Persian Gulf basin, now submerged, was situated somewhere near present-day Bahrain. The discovery in recent years of settlements, permanent stone houses, pottery, boats, and domesticated animals along the shores of the Gulf now suggests cities existing as far back as 7,500 years ago.[^2] Our archaeological understanding continues to expand, and hopefully our diggings will someday reach the deep ancient levels associated with Dalamatia. 

The “Dalamatian teachings,” [[UB 92:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_5)] the first epochal revelation of truth, were dispensed on Earth 500,000 years ago during the fifth glacial advance, one less extensive than the previous four ice ages. Warm conditions again prevailed in the “Mesopotamian” region, a climate conducive to the Dalamatian project of encouraging the evolution of primitive humanity “from a hunter to a herder.” The result hoped for was that “man” would “_evolve into a peace-loving, home abiding farmer._” [[UB 66:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_2)] 

The red race was one of the three primary Sangik peoples, from among the six colored races, who lived in this Mesopotamian region, and received training during Prince Caligastia’s regime. The orange race also “_profited much from the schools of the Prince and sent delegates there for instruction._” [[UB 64:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_10)] 

There are four surviving groups of the six Sangik races on Urantia today: red, yellow, blue (now blended with the violet and other races to emerge as today’s white race), and one secondary Sangik race, the indigo (black). Some traces of the orange and the green races (unknown in our history) still exist in India, and remnants of a blended orange, blue, and red race still inhabit Central and South America. Our anthropologists and archaeologists have gathered a large body of fossil evidence since the Bible was first printed, and it confirms that a great variety of human types existed for long ages on Earth. Some lived long before the traditional time assigned to the Garden of Eden which, once we reject the discredited date of 4,004 BCE, a liberal, albeit Christian, scientist might date to 40,000 years ago (as some do). One difficulty posed for Christian tradition by _The Urantia Book_ is how definitively it comes down in favor of an evolutionary origin of humankind. 

Readers will also be interested in how _The Urantia Book_ version correlates with the book of Genesis and other human sources, where the dis-fellowshipped staff began the project of procreation with the men and women of the evolutionary races.[^3] The scientists studying human evolution have arrived at one consensus that modern man came into existence about 200,000 years ago. Is it a coincidence that this date matches _The Urantia Book_’s date of the outbreak of the Planetary Rebellion, and the beginnings of the Nodite race, who later emerged as the Sumerians of our known history? Evolution of the races is modified in _The Urantia Book_ by occurrences of “divine intervention,” but they don’t fit with the strict creationist concepts of the Bible. 

The Prince’s staff of one hundred was organized into ten councils (commissions, colleges) of ten members each. 

> Each of the ten planetary commissions set about slowly and naturally to advance the interests intrusted to them. Their plan consisted in the attracting the best minds of the surrounding tribes, and, after training them, sending them back to their people as emissaries of social uplift. [[UB 66:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_4)] 

Our modern generations saw this non-missionary approach presented in Star Trek TV episodes where it was called “the prime directive.” The red and blue races were chosen early on to be educated in the Dalamatian program. One of the “commissions,” the college of revealed religion, offered the students a curriculum of four components: 1) the seven chants of worship, 2) the daily praise-phrase, 3) the moral law known as the Father’s Way (the Seven Commands), and eventually 4) the Father’s prayer, in which “_the coming of the promised uplifter, the Adamic gift of a new race,_” was revealed. [[UB 66:5.13-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_13)] 

> Among the later students trained in Mesopotamia for work with their respective races were . . . representatives of the red men and the blue men . . . Hap presented the early races with a moral law. This code was known as “The Father’s Way.” . . . [[UB 66:7.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_7)] 

The encounter with the Planetary Prince would turn out to be the red race’s first and only contact with what _The Urantia Book_ calls an epochal revelation. Some tribes, especially the “Grandfather tribes,” have preserved lore of the Original Instructions, or the Seven Laws, which, I believe, likely refers to the religious teachings of the Prince’s staff. 

> . . . Of all who received the teachings of the one hundred, the red men held them longest . . . [[UB 92:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_5)] 

Because of this statement, the residual traditions of Native Americans, now less red Sangik and more of a blended race, hold more significance for students of the unique history presented in _The Urantia Book_. 

What had the “Caligastia One Hundred” said about their own origins to the Sangik students? American Indian teachings are often intermixed with references to those they call, “the Star People,” or to groups known as “the Star Nations.” In the Lakota tradition, the supernatural hero-being who gave them the Original Teachings, is named Fallen Star. 

Instruction in Dalamatia was abruptly aborted by the onset of the Lucifer rebellion that ensnared Caligastia and Urantia, the world he ruled. His staff was split in their al legiances. Sixty members of the group of one hundred stayed loyal to the Planetary Prince, while forty of them became followers of Van and Amadon, professing their continuing loyalty to the Universal Father and his Son. 

## The Planetary Rebellion 

Let us review how _The Urantia Book_ authors frame Paper 67: the “_problems associated with human existence on Urantia are impossible of understanding without a knowledge of the occurrence and the consequences of the planetary rebellion._” [[UB 67:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p0_1)] For a planet that has almost completely forgotten the paltry remaining knowledge of the rebellion, this statement admonishing us to understand it better comes as a shock. 

For 300,000 years, all seemed to be going well. Then about 200,000 years before the present, Caligastia endorsed the Manifesto and the “Declaration of Liberty,” of his superior, Lucifer, the system ruler. Helpless Urantia, along with thirty-six other worlds in our system of Satania, was drawn into the rebellion. [[UB 53:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_1)] These evolutionary worlds were immediately cut off from the universe broadcasts. 

We are told that, “_at the outbreak of the rebellion, Dalamatia had a resident population of almost six thousand. This number includes the regular students._” [[UB 66:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_20)] The red race, along with the six thousand citizens and visitors usually numbering up to an additional one thousand, witnessed the visible outer effects of the war in heaven. I wonder if perhaps not much could actually be seen and understood. However, they did experience the default of the Caligastia program of upliftment. They grieved the defection of their “extraplanetary teachers.” Eventually, they would have learned of the city’s loss of the tree of life. 

Recall that the groups being trained in the Prince’s program were Andonites, mostly primary Sangiks, red, blue and yellow, along with some of the orange race who were present. Very little is said about the response of these early humans to the outbreak of rebellion among their marvelous teachers. At the beginning of the conflict, loyalists led by Van and Amadon moved out of the city of the Prince to “_an unwalled and poorly protected settlement a few miles to the east of Dalamatia,_” taking with them the tree of life. [[UB 67:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_4)] 

The entire “college of revealed religion” followed Van and Amadon, whereas only some members of the other councils stayed loyal. We could attribute this result to the Lucifer Manifesto’s first war cry of the rebellion, “the Universal Father did not really exist.” It must have been a repugnant doctrine for those of the Prince’s staff immersed in the religious traditions and committed to the revelations of the universe. Today we still deal with this heritage, the persistent teachings of atheism and assertion of the self first birthed at this time in Earth’s history. 

## The Aftermath of Rebellion 

_The Urantia Book_’s concentration on the war between “superhuman personalities” tends to eclipse the effect it had on the students caught up in the whirlwind. Four pages into _The Urantia Book_ story, we read that the Caligastia rebels found it “_easy to win the support of the primitive-minded evolutionary mortals._” [[UB 67:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p4_6)] However the support was short lived. Before long, “the misled and mistaught tribes” swept down on the Prince’s city and drove the remaining staff and their associates northward where they settled in the “land of Nod.” The primitive humans who invaded Dalamatia converted the Father’s temple into a shrine dedicated to Nog, the false god of light and fire. I can imagine some idea of this evil apparition, by recalling to my mind the Balrog of Tolkien’s _The Lord of the Rings_. 

With dismay, we view this picture of the world’s races in disarray, set adrift in an allegedly ungoverned cosmos. After the rebellion of her high sons, midwayers, and angels, the central locus of a world culture with its teachings of peace, good will, and cooperation among diverse peoples collapsed. Dalamatia was overrun by those who had not yet completely learned how to substitute ideals of peaceful co-existence for natural aggression. This was a new unrestrained freedom never before promulgated by the respected leaders of the Caligastia One Hundred. Savage emotions were unleashed by the premature teachings of liberty. Rebellion was fueled by the Lucifer doctrine of “self-assertion” and “personal liberty.” The world’s capital was shortly abandoned. Meanwhile, Van and his followers moved their headquarters an even greater distance from the scene of carnage and withdrew to the highlands west of India. 

With the loss of heroic superhuman direction, what were the student delegates to do? What message would they carry back to the tribes and families at home? We don’t have many details of this prehistoric era, but some aspects of a regime of peaceful coexistence were achieved during the first 300,000 years. Within a one hundred mile perimeter of the city, some farms had succeeded beyond the forty-foot walls of Dalamatia. There were mostly animal husbandry projects underway. We can be certain that with the eruption of rebellion, these communities could no longer depend on former protections. Some may have held on for a while. Most fled to safety. One hundred and sixty-two years after this great spiritual battle, the land on which Dalamatia stood sank beneath the sea. 

Not surprisingly, after the fall of the Planetary Prince, and the resulting isolation of Urantia, warfare raged between the yellow and the red races. Presumably, during the long lasting period of warmer climate we call the Eemian Interglacial (130,000 to 110,000 years before the present),[^4] both Sangik groups pushed northeastward as the ice retreated. This may be when the red Sangiks first gathered and wove their great storytelling skills. As they traveled, tales of the Prince and the wondrous city that was submerged by a tidal wave were told and retold. 

Over the next 20,000 years during the Eemian, forests expanded, extending their reach into the lands above the Arctic Circle. The yellow Sangiks followed the red race into Siberia, as they battled each other in a competitive struggle for the same resources and territory. No one was studying to be a farmer any more. They chased each other across the tundra—nomadic hunting being a natural adaptation, a way to survive the rough and tough environment of conflict and raids. When not hunting each other, they hunted wooly rhinoceros, reindeer, and wild horses. 

Warfare with the yellow race and continued migrations eastward ultimately led to the forced departure of a group of Sangik peoples across the Bering Strait land bridge. They were headed into the unknown, the uninhabited Americas, a group mostly made up of the eleven tribes of the red race, a little over seven thousand men, women, and children. But the brave pioneers included “_three small groups of mixed ancestry, the largest of these being a combination of the orange and blue races. . . . One hundred thousand years ago the decimated tribes of the red race were fighting with their backs to the retreating ice of the last glacier, and when the land passage to the west, over the Bering isthmus, became passable, these tribes were not slow in forsaking the inhospitable shores of the Asiatic continent._” [[UB 64:7.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_5)] 

Some Native American oral histories preserve a memory of the Sangik races. The Hopi of Arizona, for example, remember four races that were sent out to the four directions, each one appointed to a different task of guardianship by the Great Spirit. This native lore is in agreement with _The Urantia Book_ teaching that two of the original Sangik races, the green and the orange, had died out by 100,000 years ago. 

Of the four colored races, remembered by American Indians today as red, yellow, black, and white, it was prophesied that they would, one day in the future, come together again to live as a united people. The four are commemorated in the Pan-Indian teaching of the four-spoked medicine wheel, a widespread and universally recognized symbol. 

## The Teachings that are Remembered: The Original Instructions 

Many of the tribes remember the seven Original Instructions. They are known alternatively as teachings, sacred instructions, laws, gifts, etc. Native American oral histories tell of, “the Original Instructions—love, honor, and respect for all beings in the circle of life.” Darcy Rheault, Native Spirituality student and writer (Ojibwe of Ontario, Canada,) goes on to say, “It is taught that the Anishinaabeg were given Seven Gifts from the Seven Grandfathers of the Star World. These Seven Gifts are wisdom, love, respect, bravery, honesty, humility and truth.”[^5] Because of the migration out of Asia, the American Indian would not come into contact with the later Mosaic tradition of the Ten Commandments, but we see some overlap of the Prince’s commands with the ten that were “revealed” to Moses. 

Naturally I felt that a comparison to the religious teachings of Dalamatia should be a major topic of my research into American Indian history. I sifted and pondered the traditions of the Original Instructions and how they correlated with the Seven Commands of the first epochal revelation. First, here is the form in which the Seven Commands are given in _The Urantia Book_. This list is followed with three examples of how they are given in Ojibwe (Treaty One, Anishinaabe), Nez Perce (Chief Joseph), and Cherokee (Rolling Thunder). I have marked some of the places where there is a correspondence with the examples from the three tribes: 

Law of Dalamatia (_Urantia Book_ with my correspondences inserted): 

1. You shall not fear nor serve any God but the Father of all. (Ojibway, LOVE #1) 

2. You shall not disobey the Father’s Son, the world’s ruler, nor show disrespect to his superhuman associ ates. (Ojibway, COURAGE #3), (Cherokee, RESPECT #1) 

3. You shall not speak a lie when called before the judges of the people. (Ojibway, HONESTY #4) (Nez Perce, #3) and (Cherokee, #6) 

4. You shall not kill men, women, or children. (Ojibway, #5) 

5. You shall not steal your neighbor’s goods or cattle. (Nez Perce, #5) 

6. You shall not touch your friend’s wife. (Ibid) 

7. You shall not show disrespect to your parents or to the elders of the tribe. (Ojibway, HUMILITY & RESPECT #6 and #2), (Cherokee, #1). 

> This was the law of Dalamatia for almost three hun dred thousand years. And many of the stones on which this law was inscribed now lie beneath the waters off the shores of Mesopotamia and Persia. [[UB 66:7.9-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_9)] 

Sometimes the seven laws appear in American Indian oral traditions as simply a list of ideals to which one should aspire. What remains of the Original Instructions today also sometimes has a similar ring to the law of Dalamatia, more “Mosaic” in tone, like the Ten Commandments given much later in the Sinai desert and derived from the later teachings of Melchizedek. To this day, two hundred thousand years after the Planetary Prince’s regime was ended, the Ojibwe and other tribes maintain the ancient tradition of the seven commandments, the Original Instructions. 

Here are some typical statements of the seven teachings as they appear in three traditions. There are many examples among the Ojibwe, sometimes presented in a different order, as for example at Eagle Lake First Nation in Ontario, or in Mr. Rheault’s previous list. This version below is from Treaty One (Winnepeg, Manitoba). The Ojibwe refer to themselves in their language as Anishinaabe(g). 

## 1. The Seven Values or Teachings of the Ojibwe 

> “The Anishinaabeg were to always act in LOVE. 
> 
> 1. To love the Great Spirit the same way he loved his people, because it was the love of the Great Spirit that gave life. 
> 
> 2. To RESPECT all life in Mother Earth. To show real respect was to give of themselves for the benefit of all life. 
> 
> 3. To have COURAGE to always do that was morally right. 
> 
> 4. To be HONEST to themselves. To live in the spirit of how they were created. Never to lie or gossip about one another. 
> 
> 5. To live in WISDOM and that is knowing the gifts that the Great Spirit gave to everyone. To use these gifts to build a family and community. 
> 
> 6. Always to act in HUMILITY. One was to always think about their fellows and their community be fore they thought of themselves. 
> 
> 7. Always to seek the TRUTH. The truth lies in spirit.”[^6]

We quickly recognize the strong ethical core that characterizes the remembered Original Instructions. A question came up for me concerning “honesty,” for example, because it always appears in the list of the Original Instructions. Is honesty in action a result of the divine commandment to be honest? “Anishnaabeg were always to be honest to themselves.” Darcy Rheault believes native philosophy recognizes honesty as an “a priori.” The “Seven Gifts” are, “not commandments … [but] encoded in our being, our spirit.” Mr. Rheault is referring to the same phenomenon of mind that the philosopher Immanuel Kant described as “inborn cognitive structures.” If they are inborn, they must also naturally require training and instruction to make them practicable, in order to apply them to daily life in the physical world. 

## 2. The Seven Laws of the Nez Perce 

Chief Joseph (Nez Perce) could recall seven of what he called laws (I’ve inserted the numbers in his remembered speech below). His expression of the “Instructions” preserved some of the “commandment” quality found in the Dalamatia version: 

“Our fathers gave us many laws, which they had learned from their fathers. These laws were good. They told us to … (1) treat all people as they treated us; (2) that we should never be the first to break a bargain; (3) that it was a disgrace to tell a lie [also #3 in the Law of Dalamatia]; (4) that we should speak only the truth (really number 3 again); (5) that it was a shame for one man to take another’s wife or his property without paying for it. [#5 and 6 in Dalamatia] (6) We were taught to believe that the Great Spirit sees and hears everything, and that he never forgets; (7) that hereafter he will give every man a spirit-home according to his desserts: if he has been a good man, he will have a good home; if he has been a bad man, he will have a bad home. This I believe, and all my people believe the same.”[^7] 

Notice that number six and seven in Chief Joseph’s version are anomalous in that he alone in this group brings in discussions of the nature of God, along with teachings of salvation and the eternal life. His statement and Rolling Thunder’s below demonstrate the many variations we find in the “Original Instructions.” It is probable that other revelations were imported from the teachings of Onamonalonton and other important American Indian prophets. The laws of the tribes were also influenced by the new religion of Christianity. 

## 3. The Seven Laws of the Cherokee 

Rolling Thunder (Cherokee, Alabama) gives a somewhat more secularized version but still confirms a divine origin. “We were given the code, the seven laws, by the Great Spirit himself a long time ago. An old Indian man who’s been gone for many years gave it to me a long time ago.” 

Here, we still have, as he puts it, “the seven laws”: “Number one is respect for proper authority. Number two is to preserve and promote the __beauties of nature__. Number three is to judge with kindness and __wisdom__. Number four is moderation in all things. Number five is to __play fair__ in the game of life. Number six is that a person’s __word of honor__ is sacred. Number seven is __respect for difference__.”[^8] 

How were the Original Instructions preserved so successfully for so long? They became woven into the day-today fabric of the earlier hunting society. Religion and a firm spiritual grounding was not a thing apart from life. It was essential to the native’s daily survival and was always incorporated into the ordinary tasks of both men and women. 

The loyal enactment of ancient rituals also helped keep the memory alive. Ceremony confirming the integration of the people with the cosmos was essential to American Indian life. In hunter societies, before an important hunting expedition, the men would be sequestered in the sweat lodge. There, they remained isolated from their wives and the lure of sexual relations which would incur the wrath of the Manidoos (the spirits). The men prayed to the spirit of the animal and established a communion of like souls between the hunter and the sacred being he was hunting the next day. One of the most respected elders, honored for his ability to remember the people’s history, might have stood and recited the long story of Creation and Origin, astonishing everyone once again. Perhaps sometimes it happened in the form of a call and response as he read out the sacred lore of the tribe from memory. Perhaps the Original Instructions were then repeated out loud in the form of a creed just as we recite the Nicene or Apostle’s creed in churches today. These are speculations that may contain a seed of truth. 

At this time, no written record of the Original Instructions predating the acquirement of European writing has been discovered. _The Urantia Book_ tells us the red race learned a writing system while sojourning in the Mesopotamian region, “_The red man preferred pictorial writing._” [[UB 66:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_10)] The epic story of the west to east migration of the Lenni Lanape (the Delawares), ancient ancestors of the Anishinabe people, is recorded in pictographs. The Wallum Olum, an ancient written record on bark tablets and song sticks, is reputed to be the oldest written record of people in North America. Though it is said to date back to before 1,600 BCE, its authenticity is questioned. 

A tribe in Quebec, the Mamiwinini, one of the eightyfour Algonquin Nations, still cherishes their guardianship of a wampum belt that recorded the Seven Fires Prophecies of the Algonkian tribes. This belt of beads and cowry shells was made to guide the Anishinabek migration from the Atlantic Coast to the Great Lakes. It was probably created around 1,000 AD, the approximate date the migration began. 

One of the Seven Fires prophecies alludes to documents that preserve the sacred traditions. The prophecy of the Sixth Fire said that there would be a boy who would have a dream and lead the people to a hollowed out log, an ironwood tree. There, on hidden scrolls, the teachings of the Elders and the ceremonies would be discovered. So far, the “wee-gwas” (the birch bark scrolls) have never been found. 

Other Det ails of the Planet ary Prince’s Era that are Remembe red 

More is remembered than the “original” seven teachings. There are other traces of the Prince’s “epochal” story in their memories from a pre-Christian time. 

* The American Indian people believe in a celestial government from on high, an “ancient Chief” in the heavenly realm. 

* They recall the incarnation of heavenly beings in human form. 

* Their ancient stories tell of the sacred tree of life and how it was uprooted. 

* They remember to offer thanks from the earth to the spirit forces, and Great Spirit, or the Creator. 

* The northern tribes especially recall that the Immortals descended from the sky and then departed from them, traveling “beyond the ocean.”[^9]

* They remember the stone tablets “on which this law was inscribed.” 

* There is even a teaching that the place where the Original Instructions were given is now underwater. 

Chief Dan Evehema, a spiritual leader of the Hopi Nation (AZ), described the Great Spirit as follows: “To the Hopi, the Great Spirit is all powerful. He taught us how to live, to worship, where to go and what food to carry, gave us seeds to plant and harvest. He gave us a set of sacred stone tablets into which he breathed all teachings in order to safeguard his land and life. In these stone tablets were inscribed instructions, prophecies and warnings.”[^10] 

The ultimate significance of the tablets was the recorded prophecy among the Southwest peoples that when the white brother returned from the East, he would be carrying the stone tablet. Or in another version, “he” would have the missing corner of the red race’s stone tablet, once granted to them. But when the Spaniards arrived on horseback in the sixteenth century, they carried the lash, the gun, and a Bible. When a Hopi man held out his hand in the gesture meant to receive the hand of the white brother as was foretold, the conquistador dropped a cheap, glittering trinket into his palm. 

The First Nations Indian people remember that they were taught all the human races are to live in peace, a teaching Onamonalonton successfully revived sixty-five thousand years ago, long after the abandoned mission of the Planetary Prince. Indians today teach long cherished goals of achieving ethics, moral wisdom, and striving to live _Mino-Bimaadiziwin_, “the good life” in balance and harmony with the earth. Sadly, in practice, these goals fail to be carried out. The rampant prevalence of disloyalty to true values among all races is one result of the Lucifer Manifesto and his doctrine of liberty. But American Indian traditions still teach and encourage an enduring loyalty to the Creator. I believe it will be the gospel revelation of Jesus that will reinforce this loyalty to the Universal Father. Jesus will introduce them more profoundly to the depth and breadth of the Father’s love. His teachings are essential to the health and wellbeing of the American Indian community and are its greatest hope for the present. 

What lies behind _The Urantia Book_’s premise that a better understanding of human problems will be gained from the expanded presentation of the history of the Lucifer Rebellion? 

Such an improved knowledge might contribute to a more compassionate understanding of the atheism that exists, persists, and seems so widespread in our time. The doctrines of self-assertion and personal liberty promoted by Lucifer and his followers are just as easily adopted and supported by “primitive-minded evolutionary mortals,” of our day, as they were two hundred thousand years ago. It comes naturally. We are being asked to learn humility, take stock, and open our eyes to take a hard look at how the doctrines of Lucifer are still ingrained in “civilized” society, how far we have yet to go, how much work is needed to promote and establish the rule of the Universal Father in our hearts and in the world.
