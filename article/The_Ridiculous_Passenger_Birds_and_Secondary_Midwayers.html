<p>Summary</p>
<p>Just in case the earth-moon story was not enough to test our gullibility, the Book’s authors have progressed from the absurd to the absolutely ridiculous in introducing us to passenger birds and secondary midwayers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s first consider the “passenger birds.” The Papers have these incredible creatures being employed like taxis to ferry Adam and Eve to meeting places in the garden. If this was not remarkable enough we are told: “<i>These enormous birds are able to carry one or two average-sized men for a nonstop flight of over five hundred miles…These birds are most intelligent, very obedient, and unbelievably affectionate.” And they were “often able to speak many words of the languages of the realm</i>.” (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_5"><u>UB 52:1.5</u></a>)</p>
<p>Can you imagine that? Intelligent birds, able to speak the language of the realm, take-off and land with a 2-man payload and, as well, fly 500 miles non-stop with that same payload? They must be joking.</p>
<p>A second example of deliberately stretching human gullibility beyond all reasonable limits is the origin of those invisible creatures known as the secondary midwayers. Their grandparents are given as Adamson and Ratta, both labeled as belonging to a type of superhuman being who looked and acted “normal” and were able to interbreed with ordinary humans–hence were matched with us genetically and would qualify as the same species as ourselves.</p>
<p>However the Papers have this remarkable pair marry one another, then have sixty seven children. All seemed to be normal except that one out of very four was <strong>born invisible</strong>! Adamson, apparently being of scientific bent and noting that there were eight males and eight females among the sixteen invisible offspring, paired them off and embarked on a breeding program to see what would happen.</p>
<p>The results must have amazed him. The pairs were able to reproduce themselves every seventy days, their offspring not only being invisible but were born fully developed and fully mature–“though they never ceased to grow in wisdom and experience.”</p>
<p>These unusual offspring were called the secondary midwayers. Though incapable of procreation, they have no need for sleep nor for earthly material food, being energized from “space emanations” that are a mystery to us humans. And they are immortal! (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p6_1"><u>UB 77:6.1</u></a>)</p>
<p>If Urantia Book readers read such material in the Bible or the Koran they would likely collapse in raucous laughter. So surely these two examples must force us to consider whether the revelators have repeatedly challenged our intellects, virtually begging us to refrain from converting their precious revelation into an infallible icon.</p>
