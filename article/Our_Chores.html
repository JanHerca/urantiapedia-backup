<p>Dedicate your life to demonstrating the combined human affection and divine dignity of the God-knowing mortal.</p>
<p>As far as is in your power live long on earth that your life of many years may be fruitful in souls won for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>To those who are God-knowing there is no such thing as common labor or secular toil. All honest earthly labor is sacred and is a service–even to God our Father.</p>
<p>But learn that even the expression of a good thought may need to be modulated in accordance with the understanding of the hearer. And neglect not to minister to the needy, the poor, the young. <i>Bon voyage</i>.</p>
<hr>
<p>That concludes our examples of attempting to fulfil the edicts of that page 43 request to produce a new and righteous vision of morality. The foundation of such a vision would surely need to be that we love all men regardless of what they are like. The secret in being able to do so is in the words:</p>
<p>“<i>If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love.</i>” (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4"><u>UB 100:4.4</u></a>)</p>
<p>An academic-style philosophical work of the intensity of even the Urantia revelation seems unlikely to achieve sufficient popularity to be effective. A novel with no religious connotations but a central character who does just that possibly could do so.</p>
<p>An alternative is thousands of minor, short works, articles, web sites, etc. all attempting the task and overcoming the handicaps through sheer quantity and persistence.</p>
<p>But primarily, we must live as Jesus lived.</p>
