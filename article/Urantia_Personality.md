The Universal Father bestows personality upon numerous orders of beings as they function on diverse levels of universe actuality. Urantia human beings are endowed with personality of the finite-mortal type, functioning on the level of the ascending sons of God.

Personality is a unique endowment of original nature, the existence of which is independent of, and antecedent to, the bestowal of the indwelling Spirit-of-God--nevertheless, the presence of this spirit reality does augment the qualitative manifestation of personality.

Personalities may be similar, but they are never the same. Personality is that feature of an individual which we can know--and which enables us to identify such a being at any future time regardless of the nature and extent of all changes in form, mind, or spirit status undergone by that personality.

Creature personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting and characteristic phenomena of reactive behavior--self-consciousness and associated relative free will.

Self-consciousness is the intellectual awareness of personality actuality. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities--the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe.

The relative free will which characterizes the self-consciousness of human personality is involved in: 
- _Moral decision making, highest wisdom._
- _Spiritual choice, truth discernment._
- _Unselfish love, brotherhood service._
- _Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty._
- _Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meanings._
- _Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father's will._
- _Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver_.

The bestowal of the divine gift of personality upon such a mind-endowed mortal mechanism confers the dignity of cosmic citizenship and enables such a mortal creature forthwith to become reactive to the constitutive recognition of the three basic mind realities of the cosmos: 
- _The mathematical or logical recognition of the uniformity of physical causation._
- _The reasoned recognition of the obligation of moral conduct._
- _The faith-grasp of the fellowship worship of Deity, associated with the loving service of humanity._

The full function of such a personality endowment is the beginning realization of Deity kinship. Such a selfhood, indwelt by a pre-personal fragment of God the Father, is in truth and in fact a spiritual son of God.
