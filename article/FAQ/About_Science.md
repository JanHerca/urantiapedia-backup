## What is Cosmology?

**_Material Science and Cosmology_**

> Mathematics, material science, is indispensable to the intelligent discussion of the material aspects of the universe, but such knowledge is not necessarily a part of the higher realization of truth or of the personal appreciation of spiritual realities. Not only in the realms of life but even in the world of physical energy, the sum of two or more things is very often something _more_ than, or something _different_ [UB 12:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_3)

**_Cosmology in the Spheres of Light and Life_**

> The provisions for competitive play, humor, and other phases of personal and group achievement are ample and appropriate. A special feature of the competitive activities on such a highly cultured world concerns the efforts of individuals and groups to excel in the sciences and philosophies of cosmology. Literature and oratory flourish, and languageis so improved as to be symbolic of concepts as well as to be expressive of ideas. Life is refreshingly simple; man has at last co-ordinated a high state of mechanical development with an inspiring intellectual attainment and has overshadowed both with an exquisite spiritual achievement. The pursuit of happiness is an experience of joy and satisfaction. [UB 55:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_6)

**_Beauty and Cosmology_**

> Philosophy you somewhat grasp, and divinity you comprehend in worship, social service, and personal spiritual experience, but the pursuit of beauty--cosmology--you all too often limit to the study of man's crude artistic endeavors. Beauty, art, is largely a matter of the unification of contrasts. Variety is essential to the concept of beauty. The supreme beauty, the height of finite art, is the drama of the unification of the vastness of the cosmic extremes of Creator and creature. Man finding God and God finding man--the creature becoming perfect as is the Creator--that is the supernal achievement of the supremely beautiful, the attainment of the apex of cosmic art. [UB 56:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_3)

> _Ethic sensitivity._ Through the realization of truth the appreciation of beauty leads to the sense of the eternal fitness of those things which impinge upon the recognition of divine goodness in Deity relations with all beings; and thus even cosmology leads to the pursuit of divine reality values--to God-consciousness. [UB 56:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_8)

> The inner and the outer worlds have a different set of values. Any civilization is in jeopardy when three quarters of its youth enter materialistic professions and devote themselves to the pursuit of the sensory activities of the outer world. Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. [UB 111:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_4)]

**_Religion and Cosmology_**

> While religion is not the product of the rationalistic speculations of a material cosmology, it is, nonetheless, the creation of a wholly rational insight which originates in man's mind-experience. [UB 101:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_5)

> Religion is so vital that it persists in the absence of learning. It lives in spite of its contamination with erroneous cosmologies and false philosophies; it survives even the confusion of metaphysics. In and through all the historic vicissitudes of religion there ever persists that which is indispensable to human progress and survival: the ethical conscience and the moral consciousness.  [UB 101:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_1)

**_The Urantia Revelation and Cosmology_**

> Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.
> 
> Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, _human wisdom must evolve_. [UB 101:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)

> Truth may be but relatively inspired, even though revelation is invariably a spiritual phenomenon. While statements with reference to cosmology are never inspired, such revelations are of immense value in that they at least transiently clarify knowledge by:  
> 
> 1. The reduction of confusion by the authoritative elimination of error.
> 2. The co-ordination of known or about-to-be-known facts and observations.
> 3. The restoration of important bits of lost knowledge concerning epochal transactions in the distant past.
> 4. The supplying of information which will fill in vital missing gaps in otherwise earned knowledge.
> 5. Presenting cosmic data in such a manner as to illuminate the spiritual teachings contained in the accompanying revelation. [UB 101:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_5)

> Owing to the isolation of rebellion, the revelation of truth on Urantia has all too often been mixed up with the statements of partial and transient cosmologies. Truth remains unchanged from generation to generation, but the associated teachings about the physical world vary from day to day and from year to year. Eternal truth should not be slighted because it chances to be found in company with obsolete ideas regarding the material world. The more of science you know, the less sure you can be; the more of religion you _have_, the more certain you are. [UB 102:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p1_3)


## What does The Urantia Book say about Science?

**_Science - One of the Pillars of Civilization_**

> Civilizations are unstable because they are not cosmic; they are not innate in the individuals of the races. They must be nurtured by the combined contributions of the constitutive factors of man--science, morality, and religion. Civilizations come and go, but science, morality, and religion always survive the crash. [UB 16:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_5)

**_The False Science of Materialism_**

> The false science of materialism would sentence mortal man to become an outcast in the universe. Such partial knowledge is potentially evil; it is knowledge composed of both good and evil. Truth is beautiful because it is both replete and symmetrical. When man searches for truth, he pursues the divinely real. [UB 2:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_4)

> ...Your science is engaged in the agelong contest between truth and error while it fights for deliverance from the bondage of abstraction, the slavery of mathematics, and the relative blindness of mechanistic materialism. [UB 12:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_5)

> "Unless the moral insight and the spiritual attainment of mankind are proportionately augmented, the unlimited advancement of a purely materialistic culture may eventually become a menace to civilization. A purely materialistic science harbors within itself the potential seed of the destruction of all scientific striving, for this very attitude presages the ultimate collapse of a civilization which has abandoned its sense of moral values and has repudiated its spiritual goal of attainment." [UB 132:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_3)

**_God in Science_**

> In science, God is the First Cause; in religion, the universal and loving Father; in philosophy, the one being who exists by himself, not dependent on any other being for existence but beneficently conferring reality of existence on all things and upon all other beings. But it requires revelation to show that the First Cause of science and the self-existent Unity of philosophy are the God of religion, full of mercy and goodness and pledged to effect the eternal survival of his children on earth. [UB 4:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_7)

> Science is a quantitative experience, religion a qualitative experience, as regards man's life on earth. Science deals with phenomena; religion, with origins, values, and goals. To assign _causes_ as an explanation of physical phenomena is to confess ignorance of ultimates and in the end only leads the scientist straight back to the first great cause--the Universal Father of Paradise. [UB 195:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_5)

**_Science Facts_**

> The entire science of mathematics, the whole domain of philosophy, the highest physics or chemistry, could not predict or know that the union of two gaseous hydrogen atoms with one gaseous oxygen atom would result in a new and qualitatively superadditive substance--liquid water. The understanding knowledge of this one physiochemical phenomenon should have prevented the development of materialistic philosophy and mechanistic cosmology. [UB 12:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_3)

> Science becomes the thought domain of mathematics, of the energy and material of time in space. [UB 103:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_12)

> Matter-energy is recognized by the mathematical logic of the senses; mind-reason intuitively knows its moral duty; spirit-faith (worship) is the religion of the reality of spiritual experience. These three basic factors in reflective thinking may be unified and co-ordinated in personality development, or they may become disproportionate and virtually unrelated in their respective functions. But when they become unified, they produce a strong character consisting in the correlation of a factual science, a moral philosophy, and a genuine religious experience. And it is these three cosmic intuitions that give objective validity, reality, to man's experience in and with things, meanings, and values. [UB 16:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10)

> The philosophy of the universe cannot be predicated on the observations of so-called science. If such a metamorphosis could not be seen, a scientist would be inclined to deny the possibility of developing a butterfly out of a caterpillar. [UB 42:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p9_4)

> From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. [UB 68:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_11)

> The depersonalization of so-called natural phenomena has required ages, and it is not yet completed. But the frank, honest, and fearless search for true causes gave birth to modern science: It turned astrology into astronomy, alchemy into chemistry, and magic into medicine. [UB 81:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_9)

> Knowledge is power. Invention always precedes the acceleration of cultural development on a world-wide scale. Science and invention benefited most of all from the printing press, and the interaction of all these cultural and inventive activities has enormously accelerated the rate of cultural advancement.
> 
> Science teaches man to speak the new language of mathematics and trains his thoughts along lines of exacting precision. And science also stabilizes philosophy through the elimination of error, while it purifies religion by the destruction of superstition. [UB 81:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_10)

> Science, guided by wisdom, may become man's great social liberator. A mechanical age can prove disastrous only to a nation whose intellectual level is too low to discover those wise methods and sound techniques for successfully adjusting to the transition difficulties arising from the sudden loss of employment by large numbers consequent upon the too rapid invention of new types of laborsaving machinery. [UB 81:6.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_22)

> The objects of science are identical with those of magic. Mankind is progressing from magic to science, not by meditation and reason, but rather through long experience, gradually and painfully. Man is gradually backing into the truth, beginning in error, progressing in error, and finally attaining the threshold of truth. Only with the arrival of the scientific method has he faced forward. But primitive man had to experiment or perish. [UB 88:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p4_5)

> Gradually science is removing the gambling element from life. But if modern methods of education should fail, there would be an almost immediate reversion to the primitive beliefs in magic. These superstitions still linger in the minds of many so-called civilized people.
> 
> Ancient magic was the cocoon of modern science, indispensable in its time but now no longer useful. And so the phantasms of ignorant superstition agitated the primitive minds of men until the concepts of science could be born. Today, Urantia is in the twilight zone of this intellectual evolution. One half the world is grasping eagerly for the light of truth and the facts of scientific discovery, while the other half languishes in the arms of ancient superstition and but thinly disguised magic. [UB 88:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_7)

> Science (knowledge) is founded on the inherent (adjutant spirit) assumption that reason is valid, that the universe can be comprehended. [UB 103:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_8)


## What is Evolution?

"...evolution—on Urantia or elsewhere—is always purposeful and never accidental." [UB 65:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p0_7)

Evolution is the rule of human development, but the process itself varies greatly on different worlds. [UB 49:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p1_4)

The process of planetary evolution is orderly and controlled. The development of higher organisms from lower groupings of life is not accidental. [UB 49:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p1_7)

Many features of human life afford abundant evidence that the phenomenon of mortal existence was intelligently planned, that organic evolution is not a mere cosmic accident. [UB 65:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_3)

The process of evolution is still actively and adaptatively in progress on this planet. [UB 65:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_5)

The fact of evolution is not a modern discovery; the ancients understood the slow and evolutionary character of human progress. [UB 74:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_5)

Evolution may be slow, but it is terribly effective. [UB 81:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_3)

Evolution is a cosmic technique of growth. [UB 100:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_7)

...evolution... is creativity in time. [UB 105:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p6_5)

Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail. [UB 196:3.33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_33)

Organic evolution is a fact; purposive or progressive evolution is a truth which makes consistent the otherwise contradictory phenomena of the ever-ascending achievements of evolution. The higher any scientist progresses in his chosen science, the more will he abandon the theories of materialistic fact in favor of the cosmic truth of the dominance of the Supreme Mind. Materialism cheapens human life; the gospel of Jesus tremendously enhances and supernally exalts every mortal. Mortal existence must be visualized as consisting in the intriguing and fascinating experience of the realization of the reality of the meeting of the human upreach and the divine and saving downreach. [UB 102:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_10)
