## What about Sin and Evil?

> "Evil is the unconscious or unintended transgression of the divine law, the Father's will. Evil is likewise the measure of the imperfectness of obedience to the Father's will. Sin is the conscious, knowing, and deliberate transgression of the divine law, the Father's will. Sin is the measure of unwillingness to be divinely led and spiritually directed. Iniquity is the willful, determined, and persistent transgression of the divine law, the Father's will. Iniquity is the measure of the continued rejection of the Father's loving plan of personality survival and the Sons' merciful ministry of salvation.
> 
> "By nature, before the rebirth of the spirit, mortal man is subject to inherent evil tendencies, but such natural imperfections of behavior are neither sin nor iniquity. Mortal man is just beginning his long ascent to the perfection of the Father in Paradise. To be imperfect or partial in natural endowment is not sinful. Man is indeed subject to evil, but he is in no sense the child of the evil one unless he has knowingly and deliberately chosen the paths of sin and the life of iniquity. Evil is inherent in the natural order of this world, but sin is an attitude of conscious rebellion which was brought to this world by those who fell from spiritual light into gross darkness.
> 
> "But, my son, you should know that the Father does not purposely afflict his children. Man brings down upon himself unnecessary affliction as a result of his persistent refusal to walk in the better ways of the divine will. Affliction is potential in evil, but much of it has been produced by sin and iniquity. Many unusual events have transpired on this world, and it is not strange that all thinking men should be perplexed by the scenes of suffering and affliction which they witness. But of one thing you may be sure: The Father does not send affliction as an arbitrary punishment for wrongdoing. The imperfections and handicaps of evil are inherent; the penalties of sin are inevitable; the destroying consequences of iniquity are inexorable. Man should not blame God for those afflictions which are the natural result of the life which he chooses to live; neither should man complain of those experiences which are a part of life as it is lived on this world. It is the Father's will that mortal man should work persistently and consistently toward the betterment of his estate on earth. Intelligent application would enable man to overcome much of his earthly misery." Jesus, [UB 148:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p4_3)

_**The Problem of Freewill**_

> This is the problem: If freewill man is endowed with the powers of creativity in the inner man, then must we recognize that freewill creativity embraces the potential of freewill destructivity. And when creativity is turned to destructivity, you are face to face with the devastation of evil and sin--oppression, war, and destruction. Evil is a partiality of creativity which tends toward disintegration and eventual destruction. All conflict is evil in that it inhibits the creative function of the inner life--it is a species of civil war in the personality. [UB 111:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_11)

> The possibility of mistaken judgment (evil) becomes sin only when the human will consciously endorses and knowingly embraces a deliberate immoral judgment. [UB 3:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_15)

> There are many ways of looking at sin, but from the universe philosophic viewpoint sin is the attitude of a personality who is knowingly resisting cosmic reality. Error might be regarded as a misconception or distortion of reality. Evil is a partial realization of, or maladjustment to, universe realities. But sin is a purposeful resistance to divine reality--a conscious choosing to oppose spiritual progress--while iniquity consists in an open and persistent defiance of recognized reality and signifies such a degree of personality disintegration as to border on cosmic insanity. [UB 67:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_4)

> The problem of sin is not self-existent in the finite world. The fact of finiteness is not evil or sinful. The finite world was made by an infinite Creator--it is the handiwork of his divine Sons--and therefore it must be good. It is the misuse, distortion, and perversion of the finite that gives origin to evil and sin. [UB 111:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_3)

> Good is the carrying out of the divine plans; sin is a deliberate transgression of the divine will; evil is the misadaptation of plans and the maladjustment of techniques resulting in universe disharmony and planetary confusion. [UB 75:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_3)

> It requires a great and noble character, having started out wrong, to turn about and go right. All too often one's own mind tends to justify continuance in the path of error when once it is entered upon. [UB 184:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_12)


## Is there only one true religion?

There are many, many religions which are active on Urantia. Many of them claim to be the "only one true religion," but that would not make much sense, would it? They cannot all be the only true religion, but even so, all have their value. From The Urantia Book:

> The many religions of Urantia are all good to the extent that they bring man to God and bring the realization of the Father to man. It is a fallacy for any group of religionists to conceive of their creed as _The Truth_; such attitudes bespeak more of theological arrogance than of certainty of faith. There is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith, for all contain truth. Religionists would do better to borrow the best in their neighbors' living spiritual faith rather than to denounce the worst in their lingering superstitions and outworn rituals. [UB 92:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p7_3)

> Institutional religion cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction. Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in the present crisis of civilization. [UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1)

Jesus taught:

> "The prophets have all taught you that Yahweh cares for his people, that God loves Israel. But I have come among you to proclaim a greater truth, one which many of the later prophets also grasped, that God loves _you_\--every one of you--as individuals. All these generations have you had a national or racial religion; now have I come to give you a personal religion." Jesus, [UB 145:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p2_4)


## What is The Kingdom of Heaven?

> The kingdom of heaven is neither a social nor economic order; it is an exclusively spiritual brotherhood of God-knowing individuals. True, such a brotherhood is in itself a new and amazing social phenomenon attended by astounding political and economic repercussions. [UB 99:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_2)

> The kingdom of heaven, the divine government, is founded on the fact of divine sovereignty—God is spirit. Since God is spirit, this kingdom is spiritual. The kingdom of heaven is neither material nor merely intellectual; it is a spiritual relationship between God and man. [UB 134:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_2)

**_The Keys to the Kingdom_**

> The keys of the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men have these keys. Men use them—advance in spirit status—by decisions, by more decisions, and by more decisions. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all of them—this is to choose to do the will of God. If man thus chooses, he is great, though he be the humblest citizen of Jerusem or even the least of mortals on Urantia. [UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14)

**_What Jesus Taught_**

> "Be not deceived by those who come saying here is the kingdom or there is the kingdom, for my Father's kingdom concerns not things visible and material. And this kingdom is even now among you, for where the spirit of God teaches and leads the soul of man, there in reality is the kingdom of heaven. And this kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit." Jesus, [UB 137:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_9)

> "And this kingdom which I declare to you is not a reign of power and plenty. The kingdom of heaven is not a matter of meat and drink but rather a life of progressive righteousness and increasing joy in the perfecting service of my Father who is in heaven. For has not the Father said of his children of the world, 'It is my will that they should eventually be perfect, even as I am perfect.' Jesus, [UB 137:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_13)

> "Entrance into the Father's kingdom waits not upon marching armies, upon overturned kingdoms of this world, nor upon the breaking of captive yokes. The kingdom of heaven is at hand, and all who enter therein shall find abundant liberty and joyous salvation." Jesus, [UB 137:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_15)

**_Parables About the Kingdom_**

> After the people had asked a few questions, Jesus spoke another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man sowed in his field. Now a mustard seed is the least of seeds, but when it is full grown, it becomes the greatest of all herbs and is like a tree sothat the birds of heaven are able to come and rest in the branches thereof." Jesus, [UB 151:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p4_2)

> "The kingdom of heaven is also like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, and in this way it came about that all of the meal was leavened." Jesus, [UB 151:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p4_3)

> "The kingdom of heaven is also like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man discovered. In his joy he went forth to sell all he had that he might have the money to buy the field." Jesus, [UB 151:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p4_4)

> "The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant seeking goodly pearls; and having found one pearl of great price, he went out and sold everything he possessed that he might be able to buy the extraordinary pearl." Jesus, [UB 151:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p4_5)

> "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep net which was cast into the sea, and it gathered up every kind of fish. Now, when the net was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach, where they sat down and sorted out the fish, gathering the good into vessels while the bad they threw away." Jesus, [UB 151:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p4_6)


## After reading the book, do I have to give up practicing a religion that does not conform to the teachings?

You may recall in your reading of Paper 141, Section 5 [UB 141:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p5_1) entitled "Spiritual Unity" that Jesus proclaimed spiritual liberty through unity but not uniformity. He reiterated that it is not necessary or even possible that everyone must see or feel or think alike.

While it is true that the teachings of The Urantia Book do not adhere to any specific religion they demonstrate that an enhanced vision of truth would never preclude a person from their own unique religious heritage. Students of The Urantia Book participate in every major religion. Most would tell you that studying the Urantia teachings has enhanced their religious experience in their churches, temples and synagogues. The book teaches, "God is no respecter of persons, either spiritual or material." It follows then, that the Father is no respecter of any human institution or religion; they all contain some measure of truth.

Our recommendation would be that you embrace your religion with a new sense of vigor, appreciation, and dedication; accept the best of its teachings and don't worry about the rest. Any religious teaching that does not have a basis in reality will eventually fall away.


## What is Prayer?

> Aside from all that is superself in the experience of praying, it should be remembered that ethical prayer is a splendid way to elevate one's ego and reinforce the self for better living and higher attainment. Prayer induces the human ego to look both ways for help: for material aid to the subconscious reservoir of mortal experience, for inspiration and guidance to the superconscious borders of the contact of the material with the spiritual... [UB 91:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_5)

> Prayer must never be so prostituted as to become a substitute for action. All ethical prayer is a stimulus to action and a guide to the progressive striving for idealistic goals of superself-attainment. [UB 91:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_2)

> While the nonselfish type of prayer is strengthening and comforting, materialistic praying is destined to bring disappointment and disillusionment as advancing scientific discoveries demonstrate that man lives in a physical universe of law and order.
> 
> The real prayer of faith always contributes to the augmentation of the technique of living, even if such petitions are not worthy of spiritual recognition. [UB 91:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_4)

> Prayer, even as a purely human practice, a dialogue with one's alter ego, constitutes a technique of the most efficient approach to the realization of those reserve powers of human nature which are stored and conserved in the unconscious realms of the human mind. [UB 91:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p6_4)

> Prayer is not a technique of escape from conflict but rather a stimulus to growth in the very face of conflict. Pray only for values, not things; for growth, not for gratification. [UB 91:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_13)

> Prayer is designed to make man less thinking but more _realizing_; it is not designed to increase knowledge but rather to expand insight. [UB 143:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_4)

> Prayer, when indited by the spirit, leads to co-operative spiritual progress. The ideal prayer is a form of spiritual communion which leads to intelligent worship. True praying is the sincere attitude of reaching heavenward for the attainment of your ideals. Jesus, [UB 144:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p2_2)

> The earnest and longing repetition of any petition, when such a prayer is the sincere expression of a child of God and is uttered in faith, no matter how ill-advised or impossible of direct answer, never fails to expand the soul's capacity for spiritual receptivity.
> 
> Prayer is an antidote for harmful introspection.
> 
> Prayer is a part of the divine plan for making over that which is into that which ought to be. [UB 144:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_2)


## What is Worship?

True religious worship is not a futile monologue of self-deception. Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship to be better and thereby eventually attains the best. [UB 196:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_22)

We worship God, first, because he is, then, because he is in us, and last, because we are in him. [UB 16:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_14)

Man can never wisely decide temporal issues or transcend the selfishness of personal interests unless he meditates in the presence of the sovereignty of God and reckons with the realities of divine meanings and spiritual values. [UB 99:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p7_4)

Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines the capacity for spiritual receptivity. And this interchange of strength for weakness, courage for fear, the will of God for the mind of self, constitutes worship. [UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1)

Worship is the highest joy of Paradise existence; it is the refreshing play of Paradise. [UB 27:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_5)

One of the great troubles with modern life is that man thinks he is too busy to find time for spiritual meditation and religious devotion. [UB 195:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_7)
