<p>Do We All Have A Soul?
Ron Cyr, U.S.A.</p>
<p>As a reader of The Urantia Book, it seems to me that Urantia is, and has been, what I can call a “genetic cesspool” caused by the Lucifer rebellion and the downfall of the Adamic mission. We are told how this state of affairs emotionally affected Jesus when he was faced with “the sight of these afflicted mortals, men, women, and children, suffering in large measure as a result of the mistakes and misdeeds of his own trusted Sons of universe administration, peculiarly touched the human heart of Jesus and challenged the divine mercy of this benevolent Creator Son.” (1632)</p>
<p>We are also told that, after giving a coin to a street beggar, Jesus refused to pause and speak comfortingly to the man. He said : “Why waste words upon one who cannot perceive the meaning of what you say? The Spirit of the Father cannot teach and save one who has no capacity for sonship.” (1440) What Jesus meant was that the man was not of normal mind; that he lacked the ability to respond to spirit leading.</p>
<p>Concerning the Thought Adjuster, we are adjured to rest assured in “the truth of the fact that an actual fragment of the living God resides within the intellect of every normal-minded and morally conscious Urantia mortal.” (62) And we are told &quot;all normal-minded creatures…will receive Adjusters as soon as they attain the age of moral responsibility, of spiritual choice. (596)</p>
<p>I am quoting these different sections of the book because the question arises: What happens to human beings who do not have a “normal mind?” My understanding is that if there is no capacity to make a moral choice, then such an individual cannot be indwelt by a Thought Adjuster and consequently cannot develop a soul.</p>
<p>Besides the genetic deficiencies existing in our human stock, we also have the problem of so many women, themselves on the brink of starvation, giving birth to children who, from the moment of their birth, will have barely sufficient food to survive. The mental defectiveness that occurs in malnourished children is established beyond a shadow of a doubt. This raises the problem that mental imperfection, resulting from chronic malnutrition, may result in minds that cannot receive all seven adjutant mind spirits, a primary requirement for indwelling by a Thought Adjuster.</p>
<p>So, is not Urantia now facing a situation where millions upon millions of human beings are now coming into this world having no potential for achieving ultimate spiritual reality? And the situation is worsening! Just a thought!</p>
