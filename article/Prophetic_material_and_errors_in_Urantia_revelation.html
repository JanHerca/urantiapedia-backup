<p>Please Note</p>
<p>This and the following issue of Innerface consists of a discussion of both the prophetic material In the Urantia revelation and its many apparent errors in the scientific and historic components of its text.</p>
<p>The words, ‘apparent errors’ are used in recognition that we mortals know nothing with absolute certainty. However errors in simple arithmetic are difficult to argue with and for those who hold to the concept that a revelation must be infallible, attention is drawn to the revelators. assertion that during their initial growth period, our moon and the earth remained at much the same size until the earth was one fifth its present mass—and that made the moon 16 times more massive than it now is. Moreover, the Appollo missions brought back much evidence that is quite incompatible with the revelators. account.</p>
<p>But the purpose for this presentation is not to convince committed fundamentalists of their wrongness. Rather it is to help new readers of the revelation to understand that the authors themselves asserted that not only this but any revelation provided to mortals anywhere, is partial and incomplete, and even that “this cosmology is not inspired.” Quotations from the book confirming these assertions are provided.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever realised that your God is too small? Think on this. Dotted over the night sky at a distance of about 8 billion light-years or more, are curious objects called quasars. They appear to be associated with colliding galaxies or colliding black holes. A single quasar may shine with the blinding light of 10 thousand billion ordinary suns. What on earth can they really be? What unimaginable event does such a release of energy herald?</p>
<p>This work discusses error and prophecy in the Urantia Papers. Its purpose is to put them in their right place. If the revelators used them, they must have had good reason. What could it be? Well certainly to prevent us from messing up their true purposes. Perhaps there could be no other.</p>
<p>If you find yourself unable to cope with a few harmless errors–included with a revelation for the purpose of diverting you from sabotaging its real purpose–then your God is certainly by far too small. Ask yourself did the material that bothers you have any conceivable spiritual value? If not then it was doomed to die with your brain–which may be indicative of its real importance.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Only those human experiences of spiritual value survive–your past life and its memories, having neither spiritual meaning nor eternity value, will perish with the human brain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your spirituality is the measure of your nearness to God. And so surely the true purpose of the revelators in giving us the Urantia Papers would have been to increase our spirituality. That means increasing our love for God and for one another.</p>
<p>For nigh on thirty years or more after publication of the Papers almost all its readers believed firmly in their infallibility. Many still cling to this belief, regardless of how convincing the contrary evidence may be. One conspicuous thing among those early readers that persists to this day, is that, as a group and in terms of their spirituality, they do not stand out from the average church-going Christian.</p>
<p>So why did we need a 2000 page revelation? To make us better scientists, accurate historians, accomplished theologians? Is that what Jesus did? If we go to the conversations between Jesus and Immanuel just prior to Jesus’ incarnation, we find Immanuel saying: (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8"><u>UB 120:2.8</u></a>)</p>
<p>“Your great mission…to live a life wholeheartedly motivated to do the will of your Paradise Father, thus to reveal God, your Father, in the flesh and especially to the creatures of the flesh….the achievement of God seeking man and finding him and the phenomenon of man seeking God and finding him… Exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never before been seen…, the transcendent possibilities <strong>attainable by a God-knowing human</strong> during the short career of mortal existence.”</p>
<p>This presentation is in two parts–the first gives a short introduction to historical aspects of how these Papers came about then covers some of the prophetic material. The second part is about the error component.</p>
<p>For the first thirty years of its shelf life prophecy, or error in The Urantia Book was not an issue. But then a handful of readers began to ask questions. Prior to this time both types of material were in the exclusive possession of ‘the experts.’ But then the effects of the knowledge explosion began to leak to the general public arena. Parallel with this, and due to extraordinary technological advances, was an explosion in the accuracy by which measurements could be made. The results are twofold–sheer wonderment for some of the prophetic knowledge contained in the Papers and sheer puzzlement about the error content that suddenly became exposed.</p>
<p>Items that produce true wonderment if read and digested thoroughly are those covering the discovery of the radii of the electron and proton, another being confirmation that the neutrino exists and truly is released in vast quantities during the explosion phase of neutron star formation. For anybody with a trenchancy for appraising probabilities, the careful study of these cases to assess the chances of correctly guessing the answers is likely to induce the feeling that, at the time of writing, no human author had the knowledge to do so.</p>
<p>Perhaps to comply with the universe dictum that providing us with unearned knowledge is forbidden, in both these cases the revelators quoted almost word for word from published papers. In the electron and proton radii case they made subtle alterations to the text of the quotes that vastly altered the answers obtained–but were not confirmable as correct until the 1990’s period. In the neutrino case, the authors of the original paper betrayed the fact they did not believe their own speculation, and, in fact, favored a quite different outcome. But, after a lapse of many years, it was their highly speculative suggestion, the one chosen by the revelators, which turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>Wonderment also comes if we read the Book’s account of the early parallel growth of the Earth and its Moon through an accretion process and, on checking the sums, we discover that the revelators’ account has the Moon attain a mass 16 times its present size. Curiously it took almost fifty years before anyone even noticed this obvious error. Such was the faith of readers in the infallibility of heavenly sources–and this despite the authors’ own denials:</p>
<p>“<i>Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired</i>.” (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2"><u>UB 101:4.2</u></a>)</p>
<p>[Note: In the 1930’s, the word “cosmology” still retained its traditional connotation as a branch of metaphysics dealing with features of the world as a whole–including, for example, St Thomas Aquinas’ famous cosmological argument–see Oxford University Press, Oxford Companion to Philosophy.]</p>

<h2>What If?</h2>
<p>What if the Urantia Papers had been written by a human committee bent on saving the world?</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>What if the Urantia Papers had actually been written by a human committee bent upon saving the world? Such a committee would need to have included expert-level knowledge of the Bible, the archaeology and history of the first century Palestine area, a substantial knowledge of the Roman world, plus expertise in chemistry, geology, history, physics, and general science.</p>
<p>The writing of the 2000-page Urantia Book would have required an enormous amount of time and effort. Hence it would be logical for the authors to have been highly selective in making guesses about future discoveries that could come within the scope of the “missing gap” information“ allowed by the mandate. Material that requires a degree of expertise to appreciate has already been covered. Further discussion of some of this supposed ”missing gap," unearned, but prophetic information follows.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mountain Building. The Urantia Papers associate the processes of mountain building and drifting continents as being responsible for the chain of mountains on the west coast of the Americas reaching from Alaska to the bottom of South America. (P. 689)</p>
<p>Modern readers probably do not give the statement a passing thought. But until the mid-1950’s and even later, continental drift was classified as a no-go heresy amongst the great majority of geologists. So why was it included it as a major factor for mountain building?</p>
<p>Marsupial migration. The Papers say that the ancestors of kangaroos roamed Australia 45 million years ago, and that 35 million years ago there was a land bridge re-connecting Australia, Antartica, South Africa, and South America.</p>
<p>Marsupial fossils are found in Upper Oligocene strata (35-40 million years ago) in Australia and as far back as the Cretaceous in South America (about 65 million years ago). Marsupial fossils have also been found on Seymour Island in the Antarctic. Fossil evidence indicates that marsupials did not reach Australia from either Asia or Africa. And it is highly unlikely they evolved in isolation.</p>
<p>Again, most modern readers would pass over this information without realizing that, when written, the concept of continental drift up until the 1960’s, was still a major heresy. Now the linking of these three continents constitutes an accepted part of the theory.</p>
<p>Double star Supernova Explosion. The most recent of the major cosmic eruptions in Orvonton was the extraordinary double star explosion, the light of which reached Urantia in A.D. 1572. This conflagration was so intense that the explosion was clearly visible in broad daylight. (P. 458)</p>
<p>The explosion of a supernova in 1572 was a brilliant spectacle visible in broad daylight, and became known as Tycho Brahe’s nova. The Urantia Papers say that this nova was due to the explosion of a double star. The first serious theoretical description of novas and supernovas was presented in 1957 by Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle and indicated both single and double star nova and supernova can occur. The remnant of the Tycho Brahe supernova was re-discovered in 1952 by use of the newly invented radio telescope but could not be shown to be a single or double star explosion until it was extensively mapped by the orbiting Einstein X-ray observatory in 1967 when its double star status was demonstrated.</p>

<p>X-Rays from the Sun. The interior of your sun is a vast X-ray generator. (P. 460)</p>
<p>The Sun was the first celestial object determined to give off X-Rays; rocket-borne radiation counters measured X-ray emissions from its corona in 1949. In the “Physics-Astronomy Front” by Hoyle and Narliker we find, "One of the authors remembers how, in the middle 1940’s, the question of whether the sun might emit X-rays was considered by astronomers to be highly speculative.</p>
<p>Crab nebula. “…the Crab nebula, which had its origin about nine hundred years ago, and which still exhibits the mother sphere as a lone star near the center of this irregular nebular mass.” (P.464)</p>
<p>The Urantia Paper states that the Crab nebular had its origin in a nova explosion occurring 900 years ago. The existence of a neutron star at its center was demonstrated in 1967 with the detection of a pulsar which pulsed at a rate of 30 per sec. This was far too high for it to originate from a white dwarf which would disintegrate if spinning at that speed. It could only be from a neutron star.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Except that they had access to privileged information, the authors of the Urantia Papers went out on a long light limb when they opted to embrace such phenomena as continental drift, the break-up of a super continent 750 million years ago, the consequential mountain building along the west coast of the Americas plus a land bridge enabling migration of marsupials between Australia, Antarctica, and South America. Then there is the neutron star story with its tiny particles devoid of electric potential, the figures they put to the radii of electron and proton, the suggestion of the still to be discovered strong force stabilizing protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus, and so on.</p>
<p>However, a word of caution. The chances of correctly guessing for this small selection of prophetic material are so slight that only a totally shut mind would reject their significance. But the reason for including prophetic material is not so obvious.</p>
<p>In terms of what was known in the 1930’s period, even a flawed cosmology content of the Papers would have been quite adequate to provide a conceptual “universe frame in which to think” (P. 1260) that would have been suitable for the next thirty or so years. Today it is outdated and will become increasingly so.</p>
<p>The good side of this is that it will ensure that a label of infallibility and divine authority cannot be sustained–for even those with a reasonable level of high school education will recognize the now badly outdated state of its cosmology.</p>
<p>The bad side is that many may turn away from the book without having given it due consideration–and thus miss out on its genuinely unique religious and spiritual value. Apparently the powers that be have adjudged that losing readership is preferable to the Book becoming the foundation stone for yet another fundamentalist religion.</p>
