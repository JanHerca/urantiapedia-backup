<p class="v-card v-sheet theme--light grey lighten-3 px-2">© 2004 Richard S. Omura<br>© 2004 The Urantia Book Fellowship</p>

At first presented in 2003 as a workshop at _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship Summer Study Session at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, the purpose of this tract is not only to validate the truths in _The Urantia Book_ and the meanings and values it has in our lives, but to actually suggest ways to use these nuggets of information for enriching and facilitating our spiritual growth. _The Urantia Book_ is taken metaphorically as a treasure map and the only criteria we will use for verifying the truth and validity of the map is its ability to lead us to the treasure. The “treasure” in the case of _The Urantia Book_, or any spiritual path for that matter, are the truths in it that will enable us to exhibit in our lives the “fruits of the spirit.” (Also online at: www.RichardOmura.com/st)

## What are the Fruits of the Spirit?

> ... for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. [[UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)

> And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. [[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2)]

Note that the above are lists of characteristics that are described as the “fruits of the spirit.” The list is arguably not exclusive or exhaustive in that there definitely are more such characteristics that can be listed. What we have below, however, is a simple definition of the “fruits”:

> If, then, my children, you are born of the spirit, you are forever delivered from the self-conscious bondage of a life of self-denial and watchcare over the desires of the flesh, and you are translated into the joyous kingdom of the spirit, whence you spontaneously show forth the fruits of the spirit in your daily lives; and the fruits of the spirit are the essence of the highest type of enjoyable and ennobling self-control, even the heights of terrestrial mortal attainment—true self-mastery. [[UB 143:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_8)]

Obviously, there are many facts and truths in _The Urantia Book_ that cannot be proven here and now, for example, the cosmology, the afterlife, celestial agencies and personalities, and so on. If they are real, we will certainly know later on in our universe career. However, there is information in the book that can be applied right now in our daily lives to effectively stimulate spiritual growth.

This information, the truths, are not the fruits themselves, but by their “nutrition” we can nurture the spiritual qualities of our lives. The application of these truths and the creating of systems and methods that we can use as vehicles for soul growth I term spiritual technology.

Searching the internet, there are many uses of the term _spiritual technology_. For the purposes of this article I will define my usage of this phrase and explain how the concepts in _The Urantia Book_ regarding things, meanings, and values influenced me in seeing its appropriateness.

The following chart details how _things_ lead to _meanings_ which results in the realization of values and the process of creating new working systems for personal and interpersonal transformation and soul growth.

From Things, Meanings, and Values to Technology, Government, and Service

THINGS | MEANINGS | VALUES
--- | --- | ---
Body | Mind | Soul
Fact | Idea | Spirit
Mathematical/Logic | Mind-Reason | Spirit-Faith
Causation | Duty | Worship
Science | Philosophy | Religion

By applying the above, we create the following systems:

TECHNOLOGY | LAW & ORDER/<br>GOVERNMENT | SPIRITUAL <br>RELATONS/<br>SERVICE
--- | --- | ---

* New facts from science will give birth to new technology.
* New philosophical thoughts will result in a new code of conduct.
* New spiritual truths will give rise to new ways of living and serving.

Science is the institution that we created for the study of things; applied science is technology, which has enabled us to live more comfortable lives, at least, materially. Philosophy we created for discovering meanings; applied philosophy results in laws, government, and societal mores, which has made possible an orderly society. Religion is a human institution for ascertaining values. True religion applied is service and relationships based on spiritual values. Service makes the world a better place and exemplifies self-forgetfulness and giving, as well as manifesting in activity the assurance of oneness with the universe.

As we gain more facts about things, our science progresses with corresponding advances in technology. As more meanings are discovered through philosophy, our rules for living are made better. So logically, the more truths are discovered in religion, the more advanced our service to humanity should become. _The Urantia Book_ reveals many new truths to us. How have these truths contributed toward better service? How can we go about using these truths in _The Urantia Book_ to create newer and better ways to do service and further education, art and the humanities?

## Spiritual Technology

We can use the truths from _The Urantia Book_ to create new spiritual technology. But what is spiritual technology? First of all, what is the definition of technology?

“tech·nol·o·gy 1.a. The application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives. b. The scientific method and material used to achieve a commercial or industrial objective. 2. Electronic or digital products and systems considered as a group: a store specializing in office technology. 3. Anthropology. The body of knowledge available to a society that is of use in fashioning implements, practicing manual arts and skills, and extracting or collecting materials.” [The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.]

I will define spiritual technology for the purposes of this article.

Spiritual Technology: The body of knowledge, wisdom, and truth available to a civilization that is of use in fashioning methods of spiritual growth, practicing spiritual arts and skills, and seeking higher values of spiritual attainment.
* As material technology is the manipulation of the physical world, spiritual technology is the manipulation of the person’s inner world.
* Material technology gives us the comforts of material prosperity. Spiritual technology gives the comforts of spiritual prosperity.
* The facts of science can be validated by creating material technology that changes external reality. Spiritual truths can be validated by creating spiritual technology that changes internal reality.

We can find the truths in _The Urantia Book_ and from those truths create or discover ways to apply them to the inner workings of our daily life in order to reap the “fruits of the spirit.”

## Examples Of Spiritual Technology

Mental techniques and psychology may or may not be spiritual technology. Going by my definition, it is not spiritual technology without the objective of spiritual growth. Some of the tools listed below, when used without a spiritual objective, would merely be a mental technique for self-betterment, worthwhile in its own right, but not spiritual technology.

### “Low-Tech” Spiritual Tools

Examples of old “spiritual technology.” These are tried and true techniques that have worked throughout the ages for many people.
* Affirmations
    - Oral: chants, mantras, songs, sounds
    - Visual: pictures, written word, mandalas, icons
* Rituals and celebrations—“_dramatizing the loyalties of religion_” [[UB 99:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_2)] Spinoffs—the arts: music, dance, drama
* Penitent service
* Praying for things rather than values
* Mystical meditation

### “High-Tech” Spiritual Tools

These are techniques that are evolving from low-tech tools by benefit of new truths:
* Positive affirmations based on spiritual truths
* The arts reflecting the loyalties of religion
* Loving and selfless service
* Uplifting prayer
* Worshipful meditation

Now, let’s see if we can find some information in _The Urantia Book_ that can be used to create tools for spiritual growth.

## The Reality Response

One tool that is very handy to have in seeking spiritual truth is the ability for discernment. _The Urantia Book_ tells us about a cosmic endowment that we all have, but many do not use, something that can and should be developed to a greater degree; this is called “the reality response.”

> There exists in all personality associations of the cosmic mind a quality which might be denominated the “reality response.” It is this universal cosmic endowment of will creatures which saves them from becoming helpless victims of the implied a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion [[UB 16:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_4)]

Let’s be clear in what “a priori” means. “a pri·o·ri 1. Proceeding from a known or assumed cause to a necessarily related effect; deductive. 2a. Derived by or designating the process of reasoning without reference to particular facts or experience. b. Knowable without appeal to particular experience. 3. Made before or without examination; not supported by factual study.” [The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.]

> These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, these cosmic responses, are innate in the cosmic mind, which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self-consciousness of reflective thinking. But it is sad to record that so few persons on Urantia take delight in cultivating these qualities of courageous and independent cosmic thinking.
> 
> . . . when they become unified, they produce a strong character consisting in the correlation of a factual science, a moral philosophy, and a genuine religious experience. And it is these three cosmic intuitions that give objective validity, reality, to man’s experience in and with things, meanings, and values.
> 
> It is the purpose of education to develop and sharpen these innate endowments of the human mind; of civilization to express them; of life experience to realize them; of religion to ennoble them; and of personality to unify them. [[UB 16:6.9–11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_9)]

The cosmic responses which endow all will creatures are: Causation, Duty, Worship.

> The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are:
> 
> 1. Causation—the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination.
> 
> 2. Duty—the reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination.
> 
> 3. Worship—the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, the recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination. [[UB 16:6.5–9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_5)]

This cosmic endowment, if developed and sharpened, can be used to intuitively discern the cosmic reality of any given assumption or concept. I believe that it can even be used to determine the cosmic desirability of a relationship, a business proposition, or practically any activity. Of course, it would all be in relation to “cosmic” reality, to the eternal perspective, rather than to the short term, that is, the need for immediate gratification.

For the purpose of demonstration, we will apply the concept of the reality response by evaluating a given assumption. As a visual aid, here is a graphic representation. We will grade the assumption for Causation, Duty, and Worship on a 1 to 100 scale, 100 being the highest possible score per category, 300 overall. These scores are totally arbitrary and personal. It will differ for each person.

At the workshop we first graded the assumptions of Christianity as a whole by taking random responses from the audience, then we did the same for _The Urantia Book_. This is the result:

Causation | Duty | Worship | Total
--- | --- | --- | ---
| Christinanity ||||
10 | 35 | 65 | 110
_The Urantia Book_ ||||
85 | 90 | 95 | 270

The best possible score being 300, my estimation is that most people with a well-developed reality response will not wholeheartedly embrace a belief without having a total score of around 250 or over.

Also, I believe the reality response is both intuitive and deductive. Deductive reasoning is necessary to pin down the facts in the area of Causation and to understand new meanings of Duty, while intuition is vital to arriving at the insights that lead to those meanings and in appreciating the values of the realm of Worship. However, like intuition, I think the reality response is usually quick acting, that when it is well-tuned, it will know immediately if a given assumption is in harmony with cosmic reality. But a chart like the above may be helpful in mapping out our relationship with the universe as we contemplate the decisions we face in our lives.

## Prayer

Prayer is also a potent technique of spiritual growth. _The Urantia Book_ gives us much information on perfecting this spiritual technology.

**What Does Prayer Do?** “_But real praying does attain reality. Even when the air currents are ascending, no bird can soar except by outstretched wings. Prayer elevates man because it is a technique of progressing by the utilization of the ascending spiritual currents of the universe._”

“_Genuine prayer adds to spiritual growth, modifies attitudes, and yields that satisfaction which comes from communion with divinity. It is a spontaneous outburst of God-consciousness._” [[UB 91:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_9),10]

**Is Prayer Answered?** “_God answers man’s prayer by giving him an increased revelation of truth, an enhanced appreciation of beauty, and an augmented concept of goodness. Prayer is a subjective gesture, but it contacts with mighty objective realities on the spiritual levels of human experience; it is a meaningful reach by the human for superhuman values. It is the most potent spiritual-growth stimulus._” [[UB 91:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_11)]

**How Do We Pray?** “_Words are irrelevant to prayer; they are merely the intellectual channel in which the river of spiritual supplication may chance to flow. The word value of a prayer is purely autosuggestive in private devotions and sociosuggestive in group devotions. God answers the soul’s attitude, not the words. Prayer is not a technique of escape from conflict but rather a stimulus to growth in the very face of conflict. Pray only for values, not things; for growth, not for gratification._” [[UB 91:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_12)]

**Conditions of Effective Prayer.** “_But real praying does attain reality. Even when the air currents are ascending, no bird can soar except by outstretched wings. Prayer elevates man because it is a technique of progressing by the utilization of the ascending spiritual currents of the universe._” [[UB 91:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_9)]

Remember, even if prayer does not change God, it very often effects great and lasting changes in the one who prays in faith and confident expectation. Prayer has been the ancestor of much peace of mind, cheerfulness, calmness, courage, self-mastery, and fair-mindedness in the men and women of the evolving races.” [[UB 91:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_5)]

> If you would engage in effective praying, you should bear in mind the laws of prevailing petitions:
> 
> 1. You must qualify as a potent prayer by sincerely and courageously facing the problems of universe reality. You must possess cosmic stamina.
> 2. You must have honestly exhausted the human capacity for human adjustment. You must have been industrious.
> 3. You must surrender every wish of mind and every craving of soul to the transforming embrace of spiritual growth. You must have experienced an enhancement of meanings and an elevation of values.
> 4. You must make a wholehearted choice of the divine will. You must obliterate the dead center of indecision.
> 5. You not only recognize the Father’s will and choose to do it, but you have effected an unqualified consecration, and a dynamic dedication, to the actual doing of the Father’s will.
> 6. Your prayer will be directed exclusively for divine wisdom to solve the specific human problems encountered in the Paradise ascension the attainment of divine perfection.
> 7. And you must have faith living faith.” [[UB 91:9.1–8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p9_1)]

I think it is important to differentiate prayer that is asking intercession from God, with the prayer of sending mental energy to other people. Praying for plants, for the health of yourself and others, for fame and fortune, etc. may merely be the sending out of focused mindal energy, energy that our science has yet to quantify. True prayer is a dialogue with God. The Conditions of Effective Prayer delineates the conditions of using this power effectively with distinct boundaries that define the limitations.

## Returning Good for Evil

Another “treasure” is the information on returning good for evil. This concept has often been misunderstood, ignored, and reduced to a meaningless slogan but now _The Urantia Book_ clarifies it and shines bright light on it to restore meaning to its timeless value.

> When Jesus instructed his apostles that they should, when one unjustly took away the coat, offer the other garment, he referred not so much to a literal second coat as to the idea of doing something positive to save the wrongdoer in the place of the olden advice to retaliate “an eye for an eye” and so on. Jesus abhorred the idea either of retaliation or of becoming just a passive sufferer or victim of injustice. On this occasion he taught them the three ways of contending with, and resisting, evil:
> 1. To return evil for evil—the positive but unrighteous method.
> 2. To suffer evil without complaint and without resistance—the purely negative method.
> 3. To return good for evil, to assert the will so as to become master of the situation, to overcome evil with good—the positive and righteous method.” [[UB 159:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p5_11)]

Interestingly, an audience member in the workshop commented that Number 2 on the list was important: to suffer evil without complaint and without resistance.

I felt it was good that someone bring this up because in our society, Number 2 is often thought of as of optimum value and is frequently acted upon, while there are lesser amounts of people acting on Number 3. In observing the world around me, it appears that to return good for evil sets the bar up higher than what most people in this day and age are capable of. Which is a good thing, for it gives us something to reach for.

## Personality and antecedent causation (or how I got out of my karma to free my dogma...)

Personality and antecedent causation is also related to this because as the following three quotes show, it is only in the inner life that we are creative and can be free from the shackles of material influence. Returning good for evil starts from within.

> The bestowal of creature personality confers relative liberation from slavish response to antecedent causation, and the personalities of all such moral beings, evolutionary or otherwise, are centered in the personality of the Universal Father. [[UB 5:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_9)]

> You cannot completely control the external world—environment. It is the creativity of the inner world that is most subject to your direction because there your personality is so largely liberated from the fetters of the laws of antecedent causation. There is associated with personality a limited sovereignty of will.” [[UB 111:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_8)]

> Since this inner life of man is truly creative, there rests upon each person the responsibility of choosing as to whether this creativity shall be spontaneous and wholly haphazard or controlled, directed, and constructive. [[UB 111:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_9)]

This is quite an extraordinary bit of information. This is the key to eternal life, to creativity, to returning good for evil, and to personal transformation and spiritual liberation. With this knowledge, anything is possible, for we are free from the past and the shackles of our past deeds. From within, we can change who we are to become who we want to be and it is only up to our free will to decide and make it so.

However, it is often not easy to go against our ingrained biologic tendencies in the effort to follow our spiritual leadings. This is why we have created systems of spiritual technology to enable us to better control our innate animal natures and to allow us to move toward self-mastery using the power of the mind and the lure of the spirit.

## Worshipful Meditation

The technique of contacting God, worshipful meditation, is another nugget of truth that should be used more. Some people have difficulties in effectively negotiating this process. The problem may stem from false preconceptions and the tendency to confuse mystic meditation with spiritual meditation. One of the more common reasons some people cannot meditate for longer than a few minutes is “mind chatter” and the inability to simply sit still doing nothing. Mantras and chanting are two “low-tech” methods that were developed to counter these problems. Newer methods and updates of old practices based on newer sources of information such as _The Urantia Book_ are constantly being developed.

**What Is Worshipful Meditation?** Contact with the divine presence: “_The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. Man’s greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness—contact with the divine presence._” [[UB 196:3.31](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_31)]

An attempt to communicate with God: “ . . . _Worship is, therefore, the act of the material mind’s assenting to the attempt of its spiritualizing self, under the guidance of the associated spirit, to communicate with God as a faith son of the Universal Father._” [[UB 5:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_8)]

Highest privilege and the first duty: “_Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures._” [[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1)]

Spirit-consciousness / Superconsciousness: “_If one is disposed to recognize a theoretical subconscious mind as a practical working hypothesis in the otherwise unified intellectual life, then, to be consistent, one should postulate a similar and corresponding realm of ascending intellectual activity as the superconscious level, the zone of immediate contact with the indwelling spirit entity, the Thought Adjuster._” [[UB 100:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_6)]

The word “superconsciousness” tells me that true worshipful meditation is not a trance state or any state of consciousness where we are only dimly aware of our body, mind, and surroundings. It is not a state of lesser consciousness, but a state of heightened perception. We indeed become “super” conscious.

**What Is the Benefit of Worshipful Meditation?** Gathers strength, wisdom, and energy: “_In this habit of Jesus’ going off so frequently by himself to commune with the Father in heaven is to be found the technique, not only of gathering strength and wisdom for the ordinary conflicts of living, but also of appropriating the energy for the solution of the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature._” [[UB 160:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_10)]

Becomes the highest delight and most exquisite pleasure: “_The quality of worship is determined by the depth of creature perception; and as the knowledge of the infinite character of the Gods progresses, the act of worship becomes increasingly all-encompassing until it eventually attains the glory of the highest experiential delight and the most exquisite pleasure known to created beings._” [[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1)]

## A Word of Caution!

There is a difference between mystical meditation and spiritual meditation.

> In the Master’s life on Urantia, this and all other worlds of the local creation discover a new and higher type of religion, religion based on personal spiritual relations with the Universal Father and wholly validated by the supreme authority of genuine personal experience. This living faith of Jesus was more than an intellectual reflection, and it was not a mystic meditation. [[UB 196:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_4)]

> The more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. The direct communion with one’s Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus’ life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called mystical experiences. [[UB 100:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_10)]

Dangers of Extreme Mysticism. “_Mysticism, as the technique of the cultivation of the consciousness of the presence of God, is altogether praiseworthy, but when such practices lead to social isolation and culminate in religious fanaticism, they are all but reprehensible. Altogether too frequently that which the overwrought mystic evaluates as divine inspiration is the uprisings of his own deep mind. The contact of the mortal mind with its indwelling Adjuster, while often favored by devoted meditation, is more frequently facilitated by wholehearted and loving service in unselfish ministry to one’s fellow creatures._” [[UB 91:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_1)]

> All of this gravitates consciousness toward the subconscious rather than in the direction of the zone of spiritual contact, the superconscious. Many mystics have carried their mental dissociation to the level of abnormal mental manifestations. [[UB 100:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_9)]

**Reality Avoidance** “There is great danger associated with the habitual practice of religious daydreaming; mysticism may become a technique of reality avoidance, albeit it has sometimes been a means of genuine spiritual communion. Short seasons of retreat from the busy scenes of life may not be seriously dangerous, but prolonged isolation of personality is most undesirable. Under no circumstances should the trancelike state of visionary consciousness be cultivated as a religious experience.

> The characteristics of the mystical state are diffusion of consciousness with vivid islands of focal attention operating on a comparatively passive intellect. [[UB 100:5.8,9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_8)]

Signs of Extreme Mystical Meditation
* Social isolation
* Religious fanaticism
* Gravitating toward subconsciousness rather than superconscious
* Mental dissociation
* Abnormal mental manifestations
* Reality avoidance
* Prolonged isolation of personality
* Cultivation of trancelike state
* Diffusion of consciousness on a passive intellect

## How is Worshipful Meditation Done?

Consent, initiate and conduct: “ . . . _Worship is, therefore, the act of the material mind’s assenting to the attempt of its spiritualizing self, under the guidance of the associated spirit, to communicate with God as a faith son of the Universal Father. The mortal mind consents to worship; the immortal soul craves and initiates worship; the divine Adjuster presence conducts such worship in behalf of the mortal mind and the evolving immortal soul._” [[UB 5:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_8)]

Personal communion: “ . . . _I refer to that which he so consistently practices, and which he has so faithfully taught you, the isolation of worshipful meditation. In this habit of Jesus’ going off so frequently by himself to commune with the Father in heaven is to be found the technique, not only of gathering strength and wisdom for the ordinary conflicts of living, but also of appropriating the energy for the solution of the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature._” [[UB 160:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_10)]

Meditation and relaxation: “ . . . _From the human standpoint it is a question of combined meditation and relaxation. Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines the capacity for spiritual receptivity. And this interchange of strength for weakness, courage for fear, the will of God for the mind of self, constitutes worship._” [160.3.1]

It is a joy and a pleasure: “ . . . _Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures. The quality of worship is determined by the depth of creature perception; and as the knowledge of the infinite character of the Gods progresses, the act of worship becomes increasingly all-encompassing until it eventually attains the glory of the highest experiential delight and the most exquisite pleasure known to created beings._” [[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1)]

There are many techniques, and more being formulated daily. Find one that works for you, or experiment and create one for yourself. Just keep in mind the information in the book and have fun, because, remember, it should be enjoyable. The thing to remember is that it is not a trance state or a state of dulled perception, but rather a heightened state of awareness, a superconsciousness that impinges on contact with our divine spirit.

## Eternal Life: The Sweetest Fruit of All

The greatest nugget of information in _The Urantia Book_ may arguably be the technique on achieving eternal life. This is the only place I know where a formula is given for attaining immortality!

Identification with spirit: “_Spirit identification constitutes the secret of personal survival and determines the destiny of spiritual ascension._” [[UB 40:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_4)]

“_The personality of the mortal creature may eternalize by self-identification with the indwelling spirit through the technique of choosing to do the will of the Father._” [[UB 118:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_2)]

Identification with eternal values: “_In so far as man’s evolving morontia soul becomes permeated by truth, beauty, and goodness as the value-realization of God-consciousness, such a resultant being becomes indestructible. If there is no survival of eternal values in the evolving soul of man, then mortal existence is without meaning, and life itself is a tragic illusion. But it is forever true: What you begin in time you will assuredly finish in eternity—if it is worth finishing._” [[UB 111:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_7)]

“ . . . _Mortal memory of human experience on the material worlds of origin survives death in the flesh because the indwelling Adjuster has acquired a spirit counterpart, or transcript, of those events of human life which were of spiritual significance._” [[UB 40:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p9_4)]

Mind: The arena of choice: “_Material mind is the arena in which human personalities live, are self-conscious, make decisions, choose God or forsake him, eternalize or destroy themselves._” [[UB 111:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_3)]

More than physical: “_A human mind, built up solely out of the consciousness of physical sensations, could never attain spiritual levels; this kind of material mind would be utterly lacking in a sense of moral values and would be without a guiding sense of spiritual dominance which is so essential to achieving harmonious personality unity in time, and which is inseparable from personality survival in eternity._” [[UB 133:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p7_10)]

Actively, positively and co-operatively: “_But man does not passively, slavishly, surrender his will to the Adjuster. Rather does he actively, positively, and co-operatively choose to follow the Adjuster’s leading when and as such leading consciously differs from the desires and impulses of the natural mortal mind._” [[UB 111:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_8)]

Think of your life up to this point. What elements of your life do you think will be preserved in eternity? What will survive? What will not?

Take a look at your daily activities. How many of your daily efforts and actions lead toward the ascension career?

How much of the things you do is action resulting from identification with spirit?

The Thought Adjuster only makes transcripts of those events in your life that are of spiritual significance. How much of your life is your Adjuster making a transcript of?

The more you do in identification of spirit here and now, the more of you will survive into eternity. The incon-sequentials and the negative will fade away.
* Only those things of eternal value will last.
* Identification with physical and material values ends in death.
* Identification with spirit and spiritual values results in eternal life.
* Whenever we choose spiritual values and principles over personal material gain, we are choosing to identify with spirit.

If this information is applied, will we live forever? We cannot know. There can be no evidence until we have eternalized. But there can be some evidence in our lives. I am sure you have done something based on identification with material and transient values. I am also sure that you have done things in identification with spirit and spiritual values. Reflect on the difference in how you felt, and how others reacted. It is purely personal and subjective, but the results are stored in your soul.

By applying the truths in _The Urantia Book_, we can actually enhance spiritual perception. We can inspire others to seek spiritual growth. Our “fruits of the spirit” contain the seeds that will stimulate souls into seeking spiritual upliftment. By manifesting the “fruits of the spirit” in our relationships, we are planting the seed of soul growth. From person to person, this virus of love will slowly spread until it takes over the world. This is the way Light and Life will come to our planet. This is the ultimate proof and validation of the truths in _The Urantia Book_.

_The Urantia Book_ contains many more such “treasures” as I have mentioned. The only way to ascertain their usefulness is to put them into practice. Discover them and apply them to your daily life. Use them to create systems and methods of facilitating spiritual growth. We are in very exciting times! Indeed, the adventure beckons!
