<h1>Personality, Identity, Mind, and Consciousness, in the Urantia Revelation.</h1>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Personality is the most important feature of our being. Firstly it is a unique and unchangeable gift of God. Also it is the meaning of the whole living and functioning creature–for it unifies all factors of reality, co-ordinates their relationships, and imparts the qualities of our identity and creativity. (<a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_17"><u>UB 112:1.17</u></a>)</p>
<p>In this article, we attempt an in-depth study of what the Urantia Revelation tells us about ourselves, our minds, our personality, identity, and consciousness. Our starting point:</p>
<p>From where do we derive our minds?</p>
<h1>Cosmic Mind</h1>
<p>Cosmic mind at its origin is a manifestation of the mind of the third person of the Trinity, the Infinite Spirit. It comes to us indirectly via the Seven Master Spirits of Paradise, and directly from the Creative Spirit of our local universe, along with her team of helpers, the Adjutant Mind Spirits. These are comprised of the adjutants of: intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship, and wisdom.</p>
<p>There exists in all personality associations of cosmic mind a quality which might be denominated a “reality response.” And it is this reality endowment of will creatures which saves them from becoming helpless victims of the a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion.</p>
<p>The cosmic mind unfailingly responds on three levels of universe reality:</p>
<p><i><strong>Causation</strong>–the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual. This is the mathematical form of cosmic discrimination.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Duty</strong>–the reality domain of morals, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of cosmic discrimination.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Worship</strong>–the spiritual domain of religious experience. This includes recognition of divine fellowship, spirit values, eternal survival, and ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the children of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind–the reverential and worshipful form of cosmic discrimination.</i></p>
<p>These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, are innate components of the cosmic mind which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self-consciousness of all free-will creatures.</p>
<p>In the local universe mind bestowals, these three insights of the cosmic mind are what make it possible for mankind to function as rational and self-conscious personalities.</p>
<p>These same three basic factors in reflective thinking may be unified and co-ordinated in personality development, or they may become disproportionate and unrelated in their respective functions. When they become unified, it is these three cosmic intuitions that provide objective reality for mankind’s experience in and with things, meanings, and values.</p>
