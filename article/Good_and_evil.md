It is not possible that the Spirit could have more of goodness than the Father since all goodness takes origin in the Father, but in the acts of the Spirit we can the better comprehend such goodness. The Father's faithfulness and the Son's constancy are made very real to the spirit beings and the material creatures of the spheres by the loving ministry and ceaseless service of the personalities of the Infinite Spirit.

Science is only satisfied with first causes, religion with supreme personality, and philosophy with unity. Revelation affirms that these three are one and that all are good. The eternal real is the good of the universe and not the time illusions of space evil. In the spiritual experience of all personalities, always is it true the real is good and the good is real.

"Why do you call me good? None is good but God," (Jesus)

The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the "will of the Father in heaven." Jesus' God was at one and the same time "The Holy One of Israel" and "The living and loving Father in heaven."

Sin is an experience of creature consciousness; it is not a part of God-consciousness.

The possibility of evil is necessary to moral choosing, but not the actuality thereof. Potential evil acts equally well as a decision stimulus in the realms of moral progress. Evil becomes a reality of personal experience only when a moral mind makes evil its choice.
