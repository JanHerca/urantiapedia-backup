In the universes God the Father is, in potential, the overcontroller of matter, mind, and spirit. Only by means of his far-flung personality circuit does God deal directly with the personalities of his vast creation of will creatures, but he is contactable (outside of Paradise) only in the presences of his fragmented entities, the will of God abroad in the universes.

Facing the world of personality, God is discovered to be a loving person; facing the spiritual world, he is a personal love; in religious experience he is both. Love identifies the volitional will of God. The goodness of God rests at the bottom of the divine free willness--the universal tendency to love, show mercy, manifest patience, and minister forgiveness.

The will of God is divine truth, living love; therefore are the perfecting creations of the evolutionary universes characterized by goodness--nearness to divinity; by potential evil--remoteness from divinity.

The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the "will of the Father in heaven."

## On Doing God's Will

Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification. We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself. Mortals will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. And these qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely, and to live divinely means actually to live the will of God.

Every mortal who is consciously or unconsciously following the leading of his indwelling Adjuster is living in accordance with the will of God. Consciousness of Adjuster presence is consciousness of God's presence.

The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God--with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike--divine.

And fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness--justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty.

When God's will is your law, you are noble slave subjects; but when you believe in this new gospel of divine sonship, the Father's will becomes your will, and you are elevated to the high position of the free children of God, liberated sons of the kingdom."

Though we cannot see God, we can know him. And by daily living the will of the Father in heaven, we can reveal him to our fellow men.

The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, true beautiful and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the "will of the Father in Heaven."

The imitation of God is the key to perfection; the doing of his will is the secret of survival and of perfection in survival.

Peace in this life, survival in death, perfection in the next life, service in eternity--all these are achieved (in spirit) NOW when the creature personality consents--chooses--to subject the creature will to the Father's will.

This choosing of the Father's will is the spiritual finding of the spirit Father by mortal man.

This choosing does not so much consist in the negation of creature will--"Not my will but yours be done"--as it consists in the creature's positive affirmation: "It is my will that your will be done." Jesus said: The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative. To do the will of God, therefore, is the progressive experience of becoming more and more like God, and God is the source and destiny of all that is good and beautiful and true. The will of man is the way of man, the sum and substance of that which the mortal chooses to be and do. Will is the deliberate choice of a self-conscious being which leads to decision-conduct based on intelligent reflection.
