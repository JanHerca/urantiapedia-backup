<p>About the Universal Father</p>
<p>The Universal Father is First Cause and Controller of all that is.
He created the finite universes to be inhabited by intelligent creatures who could know and love him, and be loved by him.
The supreme goal of will-creatures is to attain God—to be like him.
To “Be perfect as I am perfect” is man’s first duty.
Perfection in the infinite sense is unattainable by mortals. Their divine goal is in finite aspects of divinity of motivation and will.
The true meaning of the divine command to be perfect ever urges man onwards in pursuit of spiritual values and universe meanings.
Divine righteousness is not dominated by strict retributive justice; God as a Father transcends God as a judge.
God loves not like a father but as a father. He is the Paradise Father of every universe personality.
When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father’s will, when man gives God all that he has, then does God make that man more than he is.</p>
