<p>About the Universal Father</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Universal Father is First Cause and Controller of all that is.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>He created the finite universes to be inhabited by intelligent creatures who could know and love him, and be loved by him.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The supreme goal of will-creatures is to attain God—to be like him.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To “Be perfect as I am perfect” is man’s first duty.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Perfection in the infinite sense is unattainable by mortals. Their divine goal is in finite aspects of divinity of motivation and will.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The true meaning of the divine command to be perfect ever urges man onwards in pursuit of spiritual values and universe meanings.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Divine righteousness is not dominated by strict retributive justice; God as a Father transcends God as a judge.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>God loves not like a father but as a father. He is the Paradise Father of every universe personality.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father’s will, when man gives God all that he has, then does God make that man more than he is.</li>
