<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying, <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, [even] of the herd and of the flock. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, [but] shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
