<h1>Leviticus - 2</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn [it as] the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  As an oblation of first -[fruits] ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
