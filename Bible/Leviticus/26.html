<h1>Leviticus - 26</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me, </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God; </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses. </p>
