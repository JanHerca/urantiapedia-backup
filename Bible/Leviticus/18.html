<h1>Leviticus - 18</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover [their] nakedness: I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival [to her], to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through [the fire] to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  (for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled); </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God. </p>
