<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Yea, thou doest away with fear, And hinderest devotion before God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water! </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  (Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them): </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He runneth upon him with a [stiff] neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of [God's] mouth shall he go away. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit. </p>
