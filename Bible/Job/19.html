<h1>Job - 19</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Know now that God hath subverted me [in my cause], And hath compassed me with his net. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as [one of] his adversaries. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, [Though] I entreat him with my mouth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever! </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And after my skin, [even] this [body], is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment. </p>
