<h1>Job - 24</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox for a pledge. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness [yieldeth] them bread for their children. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [So that] they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Swiftly they [pass away] upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [So doth] Sheol [those that] have sinned. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Yet [God] preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  [God] giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth? </p>
