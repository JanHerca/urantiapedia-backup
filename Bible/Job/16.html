<h1>Job - 16</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage [your grief]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And thou hast laid fast hold on me, [which] is a witness [against me]: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no [resting] -place. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My friends scoff at me: [But] mine eye poureth out tears unto God, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor! </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return. </p>
