<h1>Job - 31</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  (Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity); </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor's door; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother's womb); </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  (Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse); </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat? </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  (The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller); </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door- </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); And [that I had] the indictment which mine adversary hath written! </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown: </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together; </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. </p>
