<h1>Job - 29</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Job again took up his parable, and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil! </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For when the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; And when the eye saw [me], it gave witness unto me: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I chose out their way, and sat [as] chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners. </p>
