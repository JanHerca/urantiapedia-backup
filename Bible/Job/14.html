<h1>Job - 14</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  [As] the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  If a man die, shall he live [again]? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth. </p>
