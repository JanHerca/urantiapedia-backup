<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I am inquired of by them that asked not [for me]; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah. </p>
