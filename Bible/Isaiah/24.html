<h1>Isaiah - 24</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly laid waste; for Jehovah hath spoken this word. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do languish. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The waste city is broken down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Wherefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders shall be glory. </p>
