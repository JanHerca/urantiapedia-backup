<h1>Isaiah - 25</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, [even] counsels of old, in faithfulness [and] truth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-hill. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim; but [Jehovah] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust. </p>
