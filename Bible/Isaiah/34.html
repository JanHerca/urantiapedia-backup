<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading [leaf] from the fig-tree. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the streams of [Edom] shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein. </p>
