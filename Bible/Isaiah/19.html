<h1>Isaiah - 19</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, [and] kingdom against kingdom. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be confounded. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the pillars [of Egypt] shall be broken in pieces; all they that work for hire [shall be] grieved in soul. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  In that day shall the Egyptians be like unto women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shaketh over them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt; every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposeth against it. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour, and a defender, and he will deliver them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and shall perform it. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto Jehovah, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  for that Jehovah of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance. </p>
