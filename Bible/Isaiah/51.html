<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hold of the pit whence ye were digged. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For Jehovah hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Is it not thou that driedst up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that madest the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing shall flee away. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall be made as grass; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die [and go down] into the pit, neither shall his bread fail. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  These two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but now with wine: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee, that have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over. </p>
