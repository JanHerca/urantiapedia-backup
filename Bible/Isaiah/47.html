<h1>Isaiah - 47</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee. </p>
