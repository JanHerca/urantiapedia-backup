<h1>Isaiah - 40</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God! </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those that have their young. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The image, a workman hath cast [it], and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth [for it] silver chains. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He that is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  [It is] he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? saith the Holy One. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice [due] to me is passed away from my God? </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  but they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
