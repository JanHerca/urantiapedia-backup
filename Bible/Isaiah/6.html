<h1>Isaiah - 6</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof. </p>
