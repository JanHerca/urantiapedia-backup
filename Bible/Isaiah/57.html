<h1>Isaiah - 57</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come]. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered [thyself] to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid [my face] and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
