<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations. </p>
