<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed [until now]: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but refuse profane and old wives' fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  These things command and teach. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee. </p>
