<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein: </p>

<p id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup>  These sought their register [among] those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. </p>
<p id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup>  And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. </p>
<p id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup>  The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, </p>

<p id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup>  And some from among the heads of fathers' [houses] gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. </p>
<p id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup>  And some of the heads of fathers' [houses] gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. </p>
<p id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup>  And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. </p>
<p id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup>  So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities. </p>
