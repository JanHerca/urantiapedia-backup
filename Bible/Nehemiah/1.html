<h1>Nehemiah - 1</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king. </p>
