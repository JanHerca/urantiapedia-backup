<h1>Joel - 1</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Tell ye your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] their children, and their children another generation. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men [and] all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Is not the food cut off before our eyes, [yea], joy and gladness from the house of our God? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. </p>
