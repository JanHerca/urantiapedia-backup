<h1>Psalms - 10</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous renounceth, [yea], contemneth Jehovah. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, [saith], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require [it]? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou hast seen [it]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth [himself] unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. </p>
