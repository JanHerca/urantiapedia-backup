<p> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide not thyself from my supplication. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Attend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity upon me, And in anger they persecute me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My heart is sore pained within me: And the terrors of death are fallen upon me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, And horror hath overwhelmed me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As for me, I will call upon God; And Jehovah will save me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many [that strove] with me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, Selah [The men] who have no changes, And who fear not God. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee. </p>
