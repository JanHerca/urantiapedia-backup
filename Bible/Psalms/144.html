<h1>Psalms - 144</h1>
<p> [A Psalm] of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, [And] my fingers to fight: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  [When] our garners are full, affording all manner of store, [And] our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  [When] our oxen are well laden; [When there is] no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Happy is the people that is in such a case; [Yea], happy is the people whose God is Jehovah. </p>
