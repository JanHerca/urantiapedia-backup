<h1>Psalms - 44</h1>
<p> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of old. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In God have we made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But now thou hast cast [us] off, and brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou hast made us like sheep [appointed] for food, And hast scattered us among the nations. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou sellest thy people for nought, And hast not increased [thy wealth] by their price. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  All this is come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from thy way, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Will not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast [us] not off for ever. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body cleaveth unto the earth. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness' sake. </p>
