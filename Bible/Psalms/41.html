<h1>Psalms - 41</h1>
<p> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mine enemies speak evil against me, [saying], When will he die, and his name perish? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And if he come to see [me], he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad, he telleth it. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise my hurt. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  An evil disease, [say they], cleaveth fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, That I may requite them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  By this I know that thou delightest in me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. </p>
