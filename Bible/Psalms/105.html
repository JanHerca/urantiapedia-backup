<h1>Psalms - 105</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac, <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [Saying], Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in [chains of] iron, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He sent Moses his servant, [And] Aaron whom he had chosen. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places [like] a river. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  For he remembered his holy word, [And] Abraham his servant. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  And he brought forth his people with joy, [And] his chosen with singing. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession: </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah. </p>
