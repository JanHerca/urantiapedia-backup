<h1>Psalms - 81</h1>
<p> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, [Where] I heard a language that I knew not. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways! </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee. </p>
