<h1>Jeremiah - 10</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it]. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation. </p>
