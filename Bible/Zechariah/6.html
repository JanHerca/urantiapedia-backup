<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [The chariot] wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  yea, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God. </p>
