<h1>Zechariah - 12</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. [Thus] saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and [they of] Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. </p>
