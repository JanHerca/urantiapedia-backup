<h1>2 Chronicles - 13</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [them that are] no gods. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [set they] in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. </p>
