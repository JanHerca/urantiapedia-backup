<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. </p>
