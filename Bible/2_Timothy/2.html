<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will. </p>
