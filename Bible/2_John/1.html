<h1>2 John - 1</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, [even] they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into [your] house, and give him no greeting: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The children of thine elect sister salute thee. </p>
