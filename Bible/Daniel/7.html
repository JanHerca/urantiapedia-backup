<h1>Daniel - 7</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. </p>
