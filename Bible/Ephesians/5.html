<h1>Ephesians - 5</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Be not ye therefore partakers with them; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Wherefore [he] saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  redeeming the time, because the days are evil. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Wives, [be in subjection] unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, [being] himself the saviour of the body. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church], not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  because we are members of his body. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and [let] the wife [see] that she fear her husband. </p>
