<h1>Song of Solomon - 1</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is [as] oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I am black, but comely, Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; [But] mine own vineyard have I not kept. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest [thy flock], Where thou makest [it] to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thy cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], Thy neck with strings of jewels. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  My beloved is unto me [as] a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  My beloved is unto me [as] a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are [as] doves. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The beams of our house are cedars, [And] our rafters are firs. </p>
