<h1>Song of Solomon - 5</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], And my heart was moved for him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands droppeth with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, That thou dost so adjure us? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  His head is [as] the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are [as] lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  His hands are [as] rings of gold set with beryl: His body is [as] ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  His legs are [as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
