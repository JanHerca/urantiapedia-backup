<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  How is the gold become dim! [how] is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  [It is] because of the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn [here]. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins. </p>
