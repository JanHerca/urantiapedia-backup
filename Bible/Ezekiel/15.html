<h1>Ezekiel - 15</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work! </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
