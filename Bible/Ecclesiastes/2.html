<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding [me] with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been done long ago. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For all his days are [but] sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  There is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For to the man that pleaseth him [God] giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </p>
