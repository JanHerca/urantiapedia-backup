<h1>Ecclesiastes - 4</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  yea, better than them both [did I esteem] him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, [saith he], do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm [alone]? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind. </p>
