<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, [is] he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [it is] he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as [grain] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God. </p>
