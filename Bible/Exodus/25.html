<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair], </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about; and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out: of pure gold shalt thou make them. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me alway. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick: </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof; </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And see that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been showed thee in the mount. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
