<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the overhanging part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above. </p>

<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And they shall be double beneath, and in like manner they shall be entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. </p>
