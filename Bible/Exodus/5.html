<h1>Exodus - 5</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, [your] daily tasks. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. </p>
