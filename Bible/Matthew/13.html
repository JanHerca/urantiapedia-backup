<h1>Matthew - 13</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He that hath ears, let him hear. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Hear then ye the parable of the sower. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, [then] cometh the evil [one], and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened. <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them: </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. <sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one]; </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. <sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: <sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: <sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous, </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? <sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> <sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup>  Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? <sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> <sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup> <sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup>  And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? <sup id="cite27"><a href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup>  And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house. <sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup>  And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. <sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup></p>
