<h1>Numbers - 23</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his! </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet [Jehovah] yonder. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do? </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. </p>
