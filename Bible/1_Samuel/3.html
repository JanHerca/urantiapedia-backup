<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see), </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he said, What is the thing that [Jehovah] hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah. </p>
