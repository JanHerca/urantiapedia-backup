<h1>Acts of the Apostles - 6</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and [against] God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. </p>
