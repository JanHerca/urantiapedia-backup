<h1>Acts of the Apostles - 28</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  [And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.] </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him, </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
