<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth [them with] words, [but] they are gone. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; [But] he that is careless of his ways shall die. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; nd set not thy heart on his destruction. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver [him], thou must do it yet again. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  There are many devices in a man's heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The fear of Jehovah [tendeth] to life; And he [that hath it] shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Cease, my son, to hear instruction [Only] to err from the words of knowledge. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools. </p>
