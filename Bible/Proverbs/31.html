<h1>Proverbs - 31</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; Nor for princes [to say], Where is strong drink? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lest they drink, and forget the law, And pervert the justice [due] to any that is afflicted. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto the bitter in soul: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all such as are left desolate. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And minister justice to the poor and needy. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The heart of her husband trusteth in her, And he shall have no lack of gain. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  She seeketh wool and flax, And worketh willingly with her hands. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  She is like the merchant-ships; She bringeth her bread from afar. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  She riseth also while it is yet night, And giveth food to her household, And their task to her maidens. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  She considereth a field, and buyeth it; With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  She girdeth her loins with strength, And maketh strong her arms. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: Her lamp goeth not out by night. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  She layeth her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household are clothed with scarlet. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; Her clothing is fine linen and purple. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth among the elders of the land. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles unto the merchant. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Strength and dignity are her clothing; And she laugheth at the time to come. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  She openeth her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Her children rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband [also], and he praiseth her, [saying]: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Many daughters have done worthily, But thou excellest them all. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; [But] a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates. </p>
