<h1>Proverbs - 12</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge; But he that hateth reproof is brutish. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A good man shall obtain favor of Jehovah; But a man of wicked devices will he condemn. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall not be moved. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A worthy woman is the crown of her husband; But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The thoughts of the righteous are just; [But] the counsels of the wicked are deceit. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood; But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The wicked are overthrown, and are not; But the house of the righteous shall stand. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  A man shall be commended according to his wisdom; But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant, Than he that honoreth himself, and lacketh bread. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain [persons] is void of understanding. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The wicked desireth the net of evil men; But the root of the righteous yieldeth [fruit]. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; But the righteous shall come out of trouble. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth; And the doings of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A fool's vexation is presently known; But a prudent man concealeth shame. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that uttereth truth showeth forth righteousness; But a false witness, deceit. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But a lying tongue is but for a moment. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; But to the counsellors of peace is joy. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  There shall no mischief happen to the righteous; But the wicked shall be filled with evil. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah; But they that deal truly are his delight. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A prudent man concealeth knowledge; But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be put under taskwork. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop; But a good word maketh it glad. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The righteous is a guide to his neighbor; But the way of the wicked causeth them to err. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting; But the precious substance of men [is to] the diligent. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  In the way of righteousness is life; And in the pathway thereof there is no death. </p>
