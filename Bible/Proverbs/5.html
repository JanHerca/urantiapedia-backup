<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she knoweth [it] not. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors [be] in the house of an alien, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  [As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. </p>
