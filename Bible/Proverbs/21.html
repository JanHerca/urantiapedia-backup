<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The king's heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the hearts. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A high look, and a proud heart, [Even] the lamp of the wicked, is sin. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty [hasteth] only to want. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, [How] the wicked are overthrown to [their] ruin. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous [cometh] in the stead of the upright. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He worketh in the arrogance of pride. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The desire of the sluggard killeth him; For his hands refuse to labor. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  A false witness shall perish; But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Jehovah. </p>
