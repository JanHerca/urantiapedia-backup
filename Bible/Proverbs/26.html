<h1>Proverbs - 26</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not seemly for a fool. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, So the curse that is causeless alighteth not. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of fools. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also be like unto him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own conceit. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool Cutteth off [his own] feet, [and] drinketh in damage. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The legs of the lame hang loose: So is a parable in the mouth of fools. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  As one that bindeth a stone in a sling, So is he that giveth honor to a fool. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [As] a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [As] an archer that woundeth all, So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  As a dog that returneth to his vomit, [So is] a fool that repeateth his folly. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way; A lion is in the streets. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  [As] the door turneth upon its hinges, So doth the sluggard upon his bed. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men that can render a reason. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that passeth by, [and] vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him, Is [like] one that taketh a dog by the ears. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  As a madman who casteth firebrands, Arrows, and death, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, And saith, Am not I in sport? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For lack of wood the fire goeth out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  [As] coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are [like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that hateth dissembleth with his lips; But he layeth up deceit within him: </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  When he speaketh fair, believe him not; For there are seven abominations in his heart: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Though [his] hatred cover itself with guile, His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded; And a flattering mouth worketh ruin. </p>
