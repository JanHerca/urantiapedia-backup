<h1>Hosea - 8</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  [Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle [he cometh] against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For they are gone up to Assyria, [like] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof. </p>
