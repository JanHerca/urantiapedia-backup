<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, [departing] from under their God. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices. </p>
