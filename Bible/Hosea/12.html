<h1>Hosea - 12</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial [name]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [He is] a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep]. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him. </p>
