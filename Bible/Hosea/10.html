<h1>Hosea - 10</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They speak [vain] words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [As for] Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out [the grain]; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off. </p>
