<h1>Hosea - 6</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are [as] the light that goeth forth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people. </p>
