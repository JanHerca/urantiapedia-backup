<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for [God's] own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Servants, [be] in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted [for it], ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously: <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. </p>
