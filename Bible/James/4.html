<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Whence [come] wars and whence [come] fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your pleasures that war in your members? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend [it] in your pleasures. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore [the scripture] saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  One [only] is the lawgiver and judge, [even] he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. </p>
