<h1>Hebrews - 8</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people: <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In that he saith, A new [covenant] he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away. </p>
