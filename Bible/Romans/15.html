<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises [given] unto the fathers, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was [already] named, that I might not build upon another man's foundation; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)-- </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  but now, I [say], I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it [to them] also to minister unto them in carnal things. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and [that] my ministration which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </p>
