<h1>2 Samuel - 16</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art [taken] in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. </p>
