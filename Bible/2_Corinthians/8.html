<h1>2 Corinthians - 8</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, [they gave] of their own accord, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and [this], not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But as ye abound in everything, [in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all earnestness, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And herein I give [my] judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But now complete the doing also; that as [there was] the readiness to will, so [there may be] the completion also out of your ability. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For if the readiness is there, [it is] acceptable according as [a man] hath, not according as [he] hath not. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For [I say] not [this] that others may be eased [and] ye distressed; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but by equality: your abundance [being a supply] at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become [a supply] for your want; that there may be equality: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  as it is written, He that [gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [gathered] little had no lack. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel [is spread] through all the churches; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in [the matter of] this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and [to show] our readiness: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in [the matter of] this bounty which is ministered by us: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which [he hath] in you. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Whether [any inquire] about Titus, [he is] my partner and [my] fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, [they are] the messengers of the churches, [they are] the glory of Christ. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf. </p>
