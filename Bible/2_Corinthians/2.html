<h1>2 Corinthians - 2</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Wherefore I beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But to whom ye forgive anything, I [forgive] also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes [have I forgiven it] in the presence of Christ; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ. </p>
