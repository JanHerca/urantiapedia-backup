<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you [as] a pure virgin to Christ. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or [if] ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with [him]. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But though [I be] rude in speech, yet [am I] not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made [this] manifest unto you in all things. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them] that I might minister unto you; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself]. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if [ye do], yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise [yourselves]. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you [captive], if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  [in] journeyings often, [in] perils of rivers, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils from [my] countrymen, [in] perils from the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  [in] labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me: </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands. </p>
