The Urantia Book Fellowship’s Summer Study Sessions have been a tradition in _The Urantia Book_ Community for many years.

Join with fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_ readers this summer as we explore “Our Relationship with God the Father.” With a focus on Papers 1-5, the Fellowship’s Education Committee is initiating a journey through some major themes in _The Urantia Book_. The conference committee is planning a variety of experiences, including workshops for new readers, in-depth study, and experiential and advanced studies.  In addition to the study program, there will be opportunities to participate in worshipful meditation and to enjoy renewing old friendships and making new ones.

Although readers gather for a variety reasons, a major incentive for attending is the high quality of the workshops that are offered.  The conference team is requesting workshop proposals appropriate for new readers as well as in-depth study for “veterans.” There will be a track for workshops that are primarily experiential, but all workshop leaders should plan to engage participants actively.

If you have an idea for a workshop on this summer’s theme, please request a Workshop Proposal Form from David Kulieke, [david.kulieke@gmail.com](mailto:david.kulieke@gmail.com).

Save the date and plan to celebrate! (A preconference retreat will be held from July 7-9.) Online registration available on the Fellowship’s website [www.urantiabook.org](http://www.urantiabook.org/CampaignProcess.aspx?A=Link&VID=23730096&KID=246666&LID=672272).
