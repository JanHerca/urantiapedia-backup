<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been a month of intense work on the [Topic Index](/en/index/topics). This is by far the most extensive and tedious work. We are talking about more than 4000 entries, many with little content but a few with very detailed content of tens of lines of text and with hundreds of references to _The Urantia Book_. This work is in progress and will take time. :sweat_smile: In addition, it is being done in parallel in both English and Spanish, although at the moment the website only shows content in Spanish.

## New content

- We have continued with the addition of the Topic Index in English and with corrections to the Spanish version. The entire Topic Index is being created using a simple TXT format with the topics organized alphabetically and one file for each letter of the alphabet.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- The converter of _The Urantia Book_ from JSON format to Wikitext format has been improved. Links are now generated in the text of the book to topics.
