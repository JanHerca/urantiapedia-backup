<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month we continue with the processes aimed at making Urantiapedia multi-language. We have created files with all footnotes from _The Urantia Book_ in a single JSON file. This will allow us to quickly translate these footnotes into other languages. :globe_with_meridians:

## New content

- Creation in [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) of a JSON file with footnotes for each language.
- Addition on GitHub of the English version of _The Urantia Book_ with footnotes in JSON format.
