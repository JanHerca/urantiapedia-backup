<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month's goal has been to prepare the Urantiapedia Tools to be able to work with any language when processing the input files and generating the web pages. Until now the page has only shown content in Spanish and we are going to try to modify it to support both Spanish and English, as a first test to support all languages. :thumbsup: :muscle:

## New content

- Corrections to the Topic Index in English and Spanish.
- The manuals for collaborators, which were previously HOWTOs in [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia), have been added to the website.
- Generation in [Wikitext](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikitext/en) format of _The Urantia Book_ in English.


## Urantiapedia Tools

- Changes in the application to support the English language when generating [Wikitex](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikitext/en) pages.
- Complete re-structuring of the app to allow multiple sections in the user interface.
