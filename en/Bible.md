The Bible is without a doubt the most quoted book or set of books in _The Urantia Book_, often through literal quotations, although almost always without specifying which biblical book is cited.

This makes the Bible a must read to try to better understand the teachings and revelations of _The Urantia Book_. For this reason the Bible, like the Urantia book, has a prominent position in the Urantiapedia content.

Every biblical book has a web page dedicated to it, and there is a page for each chapter, just as we organize any book.

The Bible does not contain the same books for different faiths. Since _The Urantia Book_ does not disparage any religious text, and mentions books considered apocryphal, such as _The Book of Enoch_, Urantiapedia will try to make an effort to include without exception all biblical and extra-biblical books whenever they have some usefulness in understanding _The Urantia Book_.

The Bible is being added to Urantiapedia so that all specific citations and any other parallel texts from _The Urantia Book_ are cross-referenced between the two texts. This cross-reference list has been based on the wonderful work of a reader, Duane L. Faw, who has compiled the references into a publication called ([Paramony](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/paramony/) ).

This and other information about how the Bible is organized in the project can be found in [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help/content).
