<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month we have focused on incorporating many more articles from readers :books: into Urantiapedia. The experience of previous months has allowed us to create utilities that speed up work with this type of content, so from here on we are going to extend this task. To this end, a [long list of reader articles](/en/index/articles) has been created. This articles are available on the Internet at various websites and will be added to Urantiapedia. The list shows the objective that we are going to set initially, but there are many other articles that will arrive in the future. Stay tuned of these news to be updated.

The work continues to multiply so remember that if you want to collaborate, this project is open to anyone who wants to contribute their grain of sand. Take a look at :point_right: [How to collaborate](/en/help/start#how-to-collaborate) :point_left:.
