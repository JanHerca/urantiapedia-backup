<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> The work to review the topics has continued at a good pace and will continue in the coming months. In addition, improvements in file conversion have made many tasks easier and faster. The summary of everything added appears below.

Remember that if you want to collaborate, this project is open to anyone who wants to do it. Take a look at :point_right: [How to collaborate](/en/help/start#how-to-collaborate) :point_left:.

## New content

- Completed revision of the [topics beginning in English with C](/en/index/topics#c), both for the English and Spanish versions. :clap:
- Completed revision of the [topics beginning in English with D](/en/index/topics#d), both for the English and Spanish versions. :clap: :clap:
- Adding tags to topics. Topics are now tagged which is great for searching. :tada: :fireworks:
- Many updates to the [help](/en/help/start) pages.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- Improved conversion of topic files to the Urantiapedia Wiki format. Mostly, an automated paragraph break has been introduced to create more consistent paragraphs. It's not perfect but it makes topics read and look better. :wink:
