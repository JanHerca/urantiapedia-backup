<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month we haven't been idle :running:. The progress with the topics continues. This month we have completed all those that begin with the letter B.

## New content

- A lot of new content has been added to the [help](/en/help/start), with more detailed explanations of the project phases, user roles and processes.
- Completed revision of the [topics beginning in English with B](/en/index/topics#b), both for the English and Spanish versions. :b: :+1:

## Fixes

- _The Urantia Book_ :blue_book: sometimes has some very curious paragraphs, which are just three dividing asterisks :eight_spoked_asterisk: :eight_spoked_asterisk: :eight_spoked_asterisk:, like here [LU 144:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_11 ). These paragraphs were missing in some languages ​​and have been added. We are looking at how to make them appear without the reference, as it happens in the printed version. :relaxed:

## Urantiapedia Tools

- Fixed a bug with the favicon that prevented it from running on Mac. :apple:
