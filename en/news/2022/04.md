<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Wow! What a month of April! This has certainly been a productive month with a mountain of new content. :muscle:

Along with the topic review, which continues unabated, reader articles and a reader's book have been added to Urantiapedia for the first time.

In this content we have released a new format and use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) instead of HTML, which is much more versatile and efficient when writing content for the Wiki. The experience with this format has been so positive that we will surely extend it to other web pages.

Without further ado, here is the full list of what's new. We hope you find them interesting.

## New content

- Completed revision of the [topics beginning in English with E](/en/index/topics#e), both for the English and Spanish versions. :smiley:

## Fixes

- _The Urantia Book_ had some errors in some papers of the Spanish version, such as [paper 59](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59). Words appearing joined that should be separated have also been detected and have been fixed. :heart:
