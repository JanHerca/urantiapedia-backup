<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been very busy :sweat:, working mostly on topics. The plan is to progress alphabetically through all of them. A lot of work had already been done with the topics about people :family:, but now it will be done systematically for each letter of the alphabet with all of them. :capital_abcd: :+1:


## New content

- Completed revision of the [topics beginning in English with A](/en/index/topics#a), both for the English and Spanish versions.

## Fixes

- Some paragraphs of _The Urantia Book_ in English were duplicated :scream: and they have been fixed.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- We have started to add [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) as a template system to facilitate the creation of interface components.
- The output of the report on topics has been improved.
