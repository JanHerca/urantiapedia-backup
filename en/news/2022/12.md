When this year began, I had no idea how far this project was going to progress in just twelve months. Definitely 2022 has been the year of Urantiapedia! You just have to look back to see how much we have grown in this time to be impressed and admired, seeing that small but constant efforts, in the end, produce enormous fruits.

A year ago we didn't even have a single article or study aid published. Basically until that date we had tested uploading _The Urantia Book_ in English and Spanish :blue_book:, part of the Biblical books :closed_book:, and the Paramony or link between them :ledger:. And that was it. The site's help was still very basic and these news pages did not yet exist. It looks awesome! 

We can be more than satisfied with what this 2022 has given of itself. It has been glorious, epic I would say. :+1: 

- **GitHub** (main project) 
    * The project has received 461 commits during the year. :sunglasses: 
    * It has received 8,170,105 additions and 1,445,885 deletions (this refers to modified lines!). :dizzy_face:

- :sunrise_over_mountains: **Images** : we have added 173 illustrations in all translations of _The Urantia Book_, translating the title of each illustration. 
- :sound: **Audio** : we had nothing at the beginning of 2022 and now there are 6 languages ​​that have _The Urantia Book_ in audio for listening and of a certain quality. 
- :information_source: **Help** : Almost all the help has been created this year, and now it's more detailed than ever and in four languages.

Wow! :astonished: What a year! The leap that the project has taken has been tremendous. And everything listed above by no means exhausts what has happened. Well, the most important thing is that this year **a notable group of collaborators** has finally been formed :woman: :man: eager to participate in the project. And we have finally presented the project to a large group of readers from all over the world.

I can only wish for one thing: a year 2023 at least as good as the one we left behind. And if possible, make it even better. With the help of our invisible friends, surely everything will come. :sparkles:
