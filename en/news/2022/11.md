<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;">This month we have made progress on all the fronts we have open in [milestone I](/en/help/phases#milestone-i-the-urantia-book-the-bible-and-topic-index) and [milestone II](/en/help/phases#milestone-ii-books-articles-study-aids-schemas-and-indexes). The team of collaborators has not stopped growing and we are getting very positive reactions to the content that already exists :+1:. We can't wait to see what reactions there will be among readers of _The Urantia Book_ :blue_book: when all the first milestones are completed. Let's take a closer look at what the month has produced on _Urantiapedia_:

## New Content

### :blue_book: The Urantia Book

- Work is underway on the :sunrise_over_mountains: image catalog to illustrate _The Urantia Book_. A few more images have been added this month. We are also testing various types of AI imaging software. For this we have used two applications at the moment: [Night Café](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/) and [Jasper AI](https://www.jasper.ai/). In [paper 43](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43) we have a couple of examples of these images. Can you say which of them have not been created by an artist?

### :closed_book: The Bible

- Added :books: vector covers in English to each book of the Bible on its cover page. For example, take a look at the book of [Genesis](/en/Bible/Genesis). Vector covers have the advantage that they are much faster to translate into other languages. Next month we will extend these covers to all books and in all languages.

### :card_index: Topic Index

- Reviews have continued to be added to some topics in English and Spanish. Perhaps the most prominent one reviewed this month is [Urantia](/en/topic/Urantia). A good number of [terms beginning in English with H](/en/index/topics#h) have also been updated.

### :books: “Source” books

- We have added the Spanish translation of the last book that was added, _The Doctrine of God_. It is available here: [La Doctrina de Dios](/es/book/Albert_C_Knudson/The_Doctrine_of_God), by Albert C. Knudson.
- The covers of the "source" books have also been vectorized. As you can see, the covers will follow some homogeneous colors that serve to identify the type of book in question:
  - Red :closed_book:: canonical biblical books (in some of the canons). Example: [Genesis](/en/Bible/Genesis).
  - Green :green_book:: extrabiblical books. Example: [Bel and the Dragon](/en/Bible/Bel_and_the_Dragon).
  - Pale yellow and brown :ledger:: "source" books. Example: [The Doctrine of God](/en/book/Albert_C_Knudson/The_Doctrine_of_God)
  - Pale pink and blue :notebook_with_decorative_cover:: books by other readers. Example: [Eugenics, Races and The Urantia Book](/en/book/Halbert_Katzen/Eugenics_Race_and_The_Urantia_Book)
  - Blue :blue_book:: books that are study aids. Example: [Workbook, Volume IV, Jesus](/en/article/William_S_Sadler/Workbook_4_Jesus)
- With these initial books we have paved the way for an application that automates loading many books at once. Development of this application will begin in the coming months.

### :notebook: Study Aids

- All English study aids have been added. You can see them in [Study aids](/en/index/study_aids). This allows us to place a task completion mark for a language. :tada: :tada:
- In the coming months, we are going to develop an application that will connect to automatic translators based on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/) ([Cloud Translation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/)) so that all study aids can be translated into all languages, and even serve extensibly for all _Urantiapedia_ content. For those study aids that have already received a translation, the existing translations will be used.

## :movie_camera: Youtube

On our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-K1YO635YwxKwjwZGTzVDw) we continue to upload new content every month, especially aimed at explaining to possible collaborators how to work on the project.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

If you want to contact us to collaborate, you have two ways:
- :blue_heart: Registering in [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/) :point_left:, which is a web page created to contact volunteers who want to collaborate on projects related to _The Urantia Book_. There we have created a project that you can request to join.
- :love_letter: Sending an email to urantiapedia@gmail.com. :point_left:

Urantiapedia is an exciting project that is making us all learn a lot. You have information on the page itself about its [planning](/en/help/phases) and the long number of [tasks](/en/help/status) currently open.
