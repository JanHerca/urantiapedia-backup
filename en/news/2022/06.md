<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Although it's apparently been a quiet month :walking:, there's a lot of work :construction_worker: in the shadows that hasn't been uploaded yet and will be uploaded next month. In June especially we have continued with the addition of articles and we have begun the translation of the first of the books that are supposed to be “sources” of _The Urantia Book_ :blue_book:, _The Universe Around Us_, by Sir James Jeans. :stars: :sparkles: This book is expected to be available in July.
