<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been a month of deep reflection and research for a new option.

The problem is that [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the software we are using for Urantiapedia, is an old software based on [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php) and developed mainly for [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Multi-language wiki creation capabilities are not an core part of the software and can only be added as extensions. These extensions do not really allow you to create a single multi-language website, but several web pages, each with a different subdomain, and all artificially linked together.

This problem has been analyzed in depth to try to see what is the best alternative when it comes to adding all the languages ​​that are wanted into Urantipadia without a hard maintenance work on the page.

After many hours of analysis and careful thought, :pensive: the decision has been made to drop Mediawiki as the software for the page, :broken_heart: and replace it with more modern software with more native functionality which is [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). :thumbsup: The ease of this software for creating multi-language wikis is remarkable, and it has the added bonus that it is designed so that page URLs remain identical in all languages, requiring only changing the language code in the URLs. This makes it much easier to determine the equivalent of a given page in each language, and greatly speeds up the process of generating the same page in different languages.

This month has been dedicated to updating the Urantiapedia Tools to support the HTML format used internally by [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/), and load tests have been carried out. The results have been very successful, so from now on Urantiapedia will be based on this software.
