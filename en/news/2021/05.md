<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month we have started to evaluate how to make Urantiapedia multi-language. :globe_with_meridians: There are currently over 24 translations of _The Urantia Book_ available. :blue_book: The first step is to reproduce with these translations all the work that is currently being done for English and Spanish, for both _The Urantia Book_ and the _Bible_.

## New content

- Addition to [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia), not to the web, of all available translations of _The Urantia Book_ on the official website of [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/), both in HTML and JSON format. See below about these formats.
- Addition of the American Standard Bible in LaTeX format to GitHub.
- We continue with the revision of the term about Jesus.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- New converter from HTML format to [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format of _The Urantia Book_. This converter has the advantage over the existing [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to JSON converter that LaTeX format is not one of those available from the Urantia Foundation official website, as HTML is. This way it will be possible to add any current or future translation very quickly.
