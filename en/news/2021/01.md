<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> The initial revision of the [Topic Index](/en/index/topics) has concluded! :thumbsup: :clap: From here topics will be added to the web. These topics, once added, will be linked to the text of _The Urantia Book_. This month we have added the topics that start with [A](/en/index/topics#a) and [B](/en/index/topics#b).

It should be made clear that this first revision of the Topic Index is by no means the definitive version of it. The content has been generated using an English index available from the [Urantia Fellowship](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/topical_index/index.htm), but this original index is very brief and was created with the idea of being included at the end of a paper edition. It is not a set of topical texts or a glossary of terms, which is our goal for Urantiapedia. Future revisions of this initial Topic Index will be needed to obtain the desired result.

## New content

- The first Topic Index review in English and Spanish was completed and the topics beginning with A and B were added to the website.
