<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> There has been little news this month. The page has suffered a spam attack creating hundreds of fake users. :rage: The security system against the creation of fake accounts was not yet enabled. Luckily there was a backup of everything, and although it was necessary to waste a little time, it was possible to restore the content up to the moment the attack began. :mask: This is something to be evaluated so that it doesn't happen again. [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) is software that has a lot of functionality to avoid these cases, but unfortunately all of this is not included as standard in the main version and must be added in the form of dozens of extensions that abound in the community. In any case the problem is solved and we are going to continue without further problems. :broken_heart:
