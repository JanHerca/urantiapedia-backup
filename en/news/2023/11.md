<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Here we are for another month to bring you the most outstanding news from Urantiapedia. This month has been particularly fruitful :palm_tree: and has brought great progress. One of the project tasks can be set as completed in one of the languages :muscle:. It is a moment of satisfaction and to look back for a moment to see how this project is growing, month by month, without rest. And also to look forward with renewed encouragement and glimpse that, at this rate, in a short time this project will contain an immense amount of valuable resources for the readers of _The Urantia Book_ :blue_book: :blue_heart:. 

## Articles

This month we have uploaded three new publications that have their original in English: 
- [The Arena](/en/index/articles_arena), from the _Australia & New Zealand Urantia Association_ 
- [Six-O-Six (6-0 -6)](/en/index/articles_606), also from the _Australia & New Zealand Urantia Association_ 
- [The Urantian — Journal of Urantia Brotherhood](/en/index/articles_the_urantian), from the Urantia Brotherhood, the former Urantia Fellowship.
- [UB Annotaded & UBTheNews](/en/index/articles_ubannotated), a collection of academic articles edited by Halbert Katzen JD.

This represents the addition of 649 new articles in English in this month of November. We currently have about 3900 articles and 750 authors added to Urantiapedia. :open_mouth: :open_mouth: 

With this new addition we can say that we have completed the task of adding the most notable publications that have their original in English. This task, probably the longest of all those in the [current milestone of the project](/en/help/phases#milestone-ii-books-articles-study-aids-schemas-and-indexes), is a big step forward. It is the result of tireless effort for more than a year. 

This does not mean that the addition of articles in English is complete, far from it. There is still much more that can be added to Urantiapedia and we will do so, but in the future. Consider the following: 
- There are many publications for which it has not been possible to find some of their issues. In the future we will do extensive prospecting to try to get all the issues and add them.
- On the other hand, when we later add publications whose originals are not in English, we will also make a translation into English, so this will further increase the number of articles available in this language.
- Finally, we must think that we have only added the publications that we have considered most outstanding, but there are dozens of other publications and, above all, websites where readers share articles and content of great interest to everyone. We hope to obtain permission to reproduce all of these works on this website, so that we can build the largest newspaper library of _The Urantia Book_ in the world. :sparkles: 

## Next tasks

From here we want to focus on several tasks in Urantiapedia: 

- Add a library of religion, theology, philosophy and science books with special interest for readers of _The Urantia Book_. We already have [a first list of books](/en/book) that we intend to add. 
- Include information in pages for articles' authors, a task that we started a month ago and that we will continue in the coming months. 
- Redesign the way of presenting access to content in a more attractive way. The current page has the default aesthetic offered by [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/), the software on which Urantiapedia is based. This design is often not enough to adequately present the indexes, and we want to improve that. 

There is a lot of work ahead, as you can see. Therefore, if you feel encouraged to collaborate with us, do not hesitate to contact us by email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. :mailbox: 

## Statistics

Although the number of sessions and users has decreased a little this month, recurring users are growing and so is the interaction time. Taking into account that the majority of website visitors are Spanish-speaking (41%) and that the content in Spanish is still not on par with the content in English, we understand that Urantiapedia still needs more time for the content to be appropriate for the type of users we have. This makes us anticipate much greater traffic in the future, when Urantiapedia content in Spanish and other languages will be exactly as extensive as in English.
