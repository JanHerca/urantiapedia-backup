<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> One more month here we are with the most notable news from Urantiapedia in recent weeks. The work continues at a good pace and without stopping. Every month the content of Urantiapedia continues to grow, and that is always a satisfaction. :relaxed:

## :page_with_curl: Articles

This month more than ever we have focused on meeting the objectives we have set regarding content in the articles part :page_with_curl:. The first big task we want to complete is to add a significant number of publications to Urantiapedia in English, which we consider the first step in terms of uploading this type of content.

During the last year we have located on the Internet a good number of websites that have regular publications or specific studies, all of them the result of the work of the community of readers of _The Urantia Book_. Now we have a fairly extensive [list of these websites](/en/help/websites) and the content that we want to upload to Urantiapedia.

This has meant that the initial planning to upload this content of articles in English has been extended by two more months, between August and September. However, the content in articles is much longer than we had initially assumed and always requires some conversion process even with content that is already available in web format. This means that adding it to Urantiapedia will take longer.

Therefore, we have prepared a new schedule for the tasks, extending the addition of all articles and publications in English to two more months, which we now estimate will end in November of this year. This, however, will not affect the final dates planned for the addition of all the content that we want to upload in the next year and a half because in other tasks we have seen that the times have been greatly shortened thanks to the [new app for translations](/en/news/2023/08) that we have. :thumbsup:

In order to follow the progress in the task of incorporating the articles we have added in the project documentation [a more detailed section](/en/help/status#articles-progress-detailed) related to this task. There you can see that we currently have the following publications added to Urantiapedia in English: 

- Urantia Foundation 
	- News Online 
	- News Flash 
	- Urantian 
- Fellowship 
	- Fellowship Herald 
	- Mighty Messenger 
- International Urantia Association 
	- Journal \* 
	- Tidings \* 
- The Brotherhood of Man Library 
	- Innerface International 
- Spain Association 
	- Luz y Vida

\* (excluding old issues that will be added later) 

The above represents more than 2500 articles in English :open_mouth:. But as you can see in the detailed planning this does not represent more than 1/3 of everything we want to upload to Urantiapedia, at least in this first initial milestone of the project. We believe that with two more months all the content currently in English will be incorporated. Content that is currently not in English and is only in Spanish and French will be added to English once the originals in Spanish and French are uploaded. But this task will be part of next year's plan. At this time we want to focus on only adding all the content available in English, which is by far the largest of all.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

During this last month many corrections have been added to the articles and studies that are translated from English to Spanish and French. These improvements are being possible thanks to the tireless work of several collaborators who help in the review task. From here goes our gratitude to them, especially to Jairo Miranda, Flor Robles and Dominique Ronfet. :clap: :clap:

You already know that if you want to collaborate with us by reviewing machine translations, or are otherwise interested in Urantiapedia, you can send us an email to urantiapedia@gmail.com. :mailbox: We are waiting for you with open arms!

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

Continuing with the information that we began to publish in recent months, here is a summary of the website's indicators.

We observe from the data that there is great stability in the number of monthly users, which always totals around half a thousand. A very good fact is that the average interaction time of users is increasing significantly, which indicates that they stop to read the content for longer. And the diversity of countries that access the website is maintained, which continues to indicate a fairly global reach. We hope that the addition of much more content in Spanish and French next year will increase this reach.
