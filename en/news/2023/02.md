## :sparkles:New content

- :page_with_curl: **Articles**: All articles from [The Fellowship Herald in English](/en/index/articles_herald) has been added. We have also started with the translation of the articles of this magazine to [Spanish](/es/index/articles_herald). During March the translation to Spanish will be expanded.
- :notebook: **Study aids**: some Study Aids have received fixes in the English and French currently available.
- :copyright: **Legal information**. We have started to create all the pages with the legal information of the site. This is a work in progress because we need to adapt the legal information to licenses that fit correctly in each country for different languages used. More on this topic will appear in news for next months.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

The collaboration with the [Jesus Metaverse](https://jesusmetaverse.org/) project continues. We have started to create a section in the *Urantiapedia Tools* that will be able to connect to [AirTable services](https://www.airtable.com/) (used by Metaverse project), to create a *Urantia Book Database* that will benefit both projects and any future project that uses information from The Urantia Book. This development is still in the first steps, and is going to be develop as a side project, so it will take some time. More news will appear regularly on this topic in a future.
