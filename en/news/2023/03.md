<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Here's what's new this past month:



## New content

- **The Urantia Book** :blue_book:: some minor typographical errors have been corrected and preparation has begun to add the authors of the documents to the index. The idea for future months is that *The Urantia Book* copy we have on Urantiapedia follows the printed editions as closely as possible, with the same indexing, with a cover page, and with all the copyright notices very clear on all pages with documents. 
- **Articles** :page_with_curl:: We're fixing errors in [The Fellowship Herald in English](/en/index/articles) articles. We also continue with the translation of the articles in this magazine into [Spanish](/es/index/articles). This is an ongoing process that will be extended to more magazines and content in English.

## Project on GitHub

Currently on GitHub, as described in [Help](/en/help), we have two projects: 
- [urantiapedia](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia): which contains the main project with an application called *Urantiapedia Tools* (`app` folder), with some input files for some information (`input` folder), and with the main output folder where all the website content is (`output` folder).
- [urantiapedia-backup](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup): Contains a copy of the previous output folder (`ouput`) that is synced to the website.

So far the *Urantiapedia Tools* application code was inside the main project. This past month we have started migrating this application to its own project at [urantiapedia-tools](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-tools). The purpose is to give this application its own identity, which was beginning to grow a lot, and modernize it by migrating it to a more modern framework such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/). We want this application to gain functionality in the coming months. There are many new ideas that we want to explore with it on topics related to connection to cloud databases, online translation services and AI management. With a more advanced application we will be able to create Urantiapedia content faster and with higher quality. For now we are taking the first steps to migrate the functionality that already existed. :ok_hand: :+1:

## Thanks to Urantia Foundation

We are pleased to announce that **Urantia Foundation** has awarded Urantiapedia with a grant as part of its [Mustard Seed Program](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program). We want to send all our thanks to all those who have supported us in awarding this grant and to all who support this project on a daily basis with their small or large contributions. Thank you all, in the end, this little seed that is now the Urantiapedia will grow into a magnificent tree at the service of many. :blue_heart: :seedling: :deciduous_tree:
