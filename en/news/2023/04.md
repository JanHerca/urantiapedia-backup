## The Urantia Book in multiple version 

Regarding **The Urantia Book** :blue_book: finally this month we have added to Urantiapedia the long desired multi-column version. :clap: This version allows reading _The Urantia Book_ both in its original English and in different translations up to a maximum of three.

The reason why we have decided to release this version in several columns is due to the imminent publication of a new revision of the Spanish translation that has caused a stir among the Spanish-speaking community of readers. 

From Urantiapedia we want to make a small contribution to the great task that the use of the different translations into Spanish is assuming. We believe that all these translations are of great value to readers, since they have been with us for a long time, and we want to offer every possible opportunity for each reader to find the reading that best suits their daily handling.

Also, this multiple version of _The Urantia Book_ is not being published only for the Spanish language, but we want to make it extensible to all languages. We know that revisions will appear in other languages ​​sooner or later, and we have prepared the system to make uploading those revisions easy. So far, we have five languages ​​that have received the multiple version: [Bulgarian](/bg/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Czech](/cs/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Spanish](/es/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [French](/fr/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index) and [Portuguese](/pt/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index). Throughout the next month the versions for all other languages ​​will be uploaded, except English, of course.

Together with this novelty we have improved the presentation of _The Urantia Book_ in many aspects: 
- **Copyright**: Now the copyright appears prominently at the top of each document. It should be remembered that the original in English, since 2006, is in the international public domain, but not the different translations. We want to extend this copyright visibility to all Urantiapedia content, which is in the works. 
- **Navigation**: The links that appear at the top and bottom of each document have been improved to navigate through them.
- **Share Paragraphs**: A *link* has been added in front of each paragraph so that a particular paragraph from _The Urantia Book_ can be shared on Urantiapedia. Just right click on the link and copy it.
- **Automation**: the creation of the indices has been automated, both single and multiple versions, which until now was done by a somewhat manual process.
- **Authors**: we continue to work on adding the names of the authors of each document, as well as creating a cover page. This will be completed this coming month.
- **Topic Index links**: perhaps the most notable improvement is that we have rewritten the algorithm for creating links to the [Topic Index](/en/index/topics). Many links that didn't make sense in the context of the paragraph where they appeared have been removed, and many more have been added. The balance is that we have almost doubled the number of links. It should be remembered that the _Topic Index_ is currently a work in progress for the English and Spanish languages, which is expected to be completed during next year. With the previous algorithm, 27,524 links were displayed in English and 26,584 in Spanish. With the current one there are now 41,756 links in _The Urantia Book_ in English, and 41,235 in Spanish. In addition, in the multiple version the links have been added to all the Spanish translations. :astonished: It should be borne in mind that these links are not all, far from it. As the _Topic Index_ is completed, the links will improve and increase. The current algorithm tries to avoid an excessive repetition of links. If the same word is mentioned in two consecutive paragraphs, only one of both shows the link. And there are other improvements that allow you to show the links that are really meaningful for each paragraph.

## Articles

The articles :page_with_curl: are the other strong point we've been working on this past month. All the articles published to date in [The Fellowship Herald in English](/en/index/articles_herald) as well as a translation [to Spanish](/es/index/articles_herald) are now available. In turn, we have uploaded four volumes (1, 10, 11, and 12) of the magazine [Innerface International in English](/en/index/articles_innerface) as well as a translation [to Spanish](/es/index/articles_innerface). This totals 374 articles in each language. :clap: During this next month we are going to upload many more articles in both English and Spanish from various publications and web pages. We have a catalog of some 2,000 articles that we hope to upload to Urantiapedia throughout this year. :pray: Once this kind of "newspaper library" on _The Urantia Book_ is uploaded, we will link the Book with those articles in the same way as we have already done with the Bible. We believe this will be of great benefit to readers of the Book. :blue_heart:
