<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> The year has ended and it is time to make balance of what has been achieved last month of December as well as year 2023. Without a doubt it has been the most productive year on Urantiapedia since this project began. It is impressive to look back and realize how much we have progressed in twelve months. If we extrapolate this same rate of progress over one or two more years, the progress will be spectacular. 

## :green_book: Books 

During the month of December we have begun the second major task of this phase. We want to create a library of books on Urantiapedia, and it is appropriate to make a clarification here because the name “Urantipedia” may confuse some. 

Urantiapedia is not going to be just an encyclopedia about _The Urantia Book_, where we will collect each topic and concept that appears in the book and dedicate a page to that topic. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, but Urantiapedia wants to be **more than an encyclopedia**. We want it to be a central storage of knowledge about _The Urantia Book_. This includes not only an encyclopedia (which is in progress) but also a newspaper library (a library of publications), a book library, a map library (a collection of maps) and a media library (a catalog of presentations, videos and audios). 

We consider the English newspaper library finished for the moment. We have added a good number of publications during this year, and we have unified the way in which these publications appear on Urantiapedia, especially the hyperlinks. Now it's the library's turn. The motivations behind this library of books can be consulted in this [introduction](/en/book). The organization in _groups of books_ (let's say they are the shelves of this library) can be consulted in [this index](/en/index/books). This introduction and index are also being added to the main side menu for quick access.

This first month of December we have concentrated on adding all the [biblical and extra-biblical books of the Old Testament](/en/index/books_judeo_christianism_ot). We want to offer readers of _The Urantia Book_ a version as complete as possible of the apocryphal texts related to the Bible. Our intention is to offer copyright-free versions in a clean and simple format, without any excess footnotes that make reading difficult. However, we always offer some indications on the cover page with links to the original documents from which these books have been obtained, in case you wish to read all the content related to each book. 

In the coming months we hope to add many more books to this _Urantiapedia library_ and here we will report on the progress. 

## A year in retrospect 

Some data that reflects the enormous progress this year: 

- **GitHub** (main project) 
    * The project has received 704 commits during the year. :sunglasses: 
    * Has received 6,523,247 additions and 1,390,782 deletions (this refers to modified lines!). :dizzy_face:

</figure> 

- :page_facing_up: **Pages** : Urantiapedia already has 58,963 pages created. We have added 9,716 new pages this year. :open_mouth: 

- :page_with_curl: **Articles** : Last year we ended up publishing 934 articles in English and 123 in Spanish. This year we have 3,697 articles in English and 1,355 in Spanish. :ok_hand: During 2024 we hope to translate all articles in English into Spanish and French. We also hope to increase our item count by another thousand. 

- :books: **Books** : We have started this last month with the task of adding books in English. We have a plan to add 694 books, of which we already have 137 books in English and 82 books in Spanish. 

- :notebook: **Study aids** : We currently have 31 study aids in English and 23 in French. The plan is to expand this list and have everything translated into English, Spanish and French. 

- :card_index: **Encyclopedia** (also somewhat erroneously called the _Topic Index_): This year we have stopped updating the encyclopedia in favor of the rest of the project's tasks. The plan is to complete it during this new year.

- :blue_book: **The Urantia Book in multiple version** : This year we have added the version of _The Urantia Book_ with several columns for translations. Of particular interest is the multiple version in Spanish, which allows the original in English and the three official translations to date (1993, 2009 and 2021) to be displayed in four columns, the last of which is still in the review period. 

- :copyright: **Legal information** : During this year we have proceeded to add a new section in the side menu with all the legal information on the website. This information has been translated into the 25 languages ​​on the site.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics 

We see this last month that the statistics numbers begin to show a repeating pattern. We have approximately 500 loyal users each month, of which more than a hundred are usually recurring. The interaction time is growing, it is now more than 6 minutes on average, which is an indicative sign that content is being read and not merely browsing the pages. Our focus in recent months on the English language is making the United States the most visited country on Urantiapedia. We assume that with the great increase in content in other languages ​​that we expect for this new year, more countries will increase their use of the website.
