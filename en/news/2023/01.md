<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Here are the news from this last month:


## New content

- :page_with_curl: **Articles**: We've revised and added quite a few [articles in English](/en/index/articles).
- :notebook: **Study aids**: almost all [French study aids](/fr/index/study_aids) have been added.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

A collaboration has started with the project team of [Jesus Metaverse](https://jesusmetaverse.org/). The idea is to join forces to create something that can last for future generations based on the common experience of both the Urantiapedia project and the Jesus Metaverse project. If you are not familiar with this project, we encourage you to take a look at it. It is a very interesting project!

From here we want to thank Gabriel Rymberg and the rest of the Jesus Metaverse team for their support and generosity allowing Urantiapedia to use their platform in a shared way.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- A new section has been developed in the app to automate the search for _The Urantia Book_ references. This new functionality allows:
    - Search for an old reference (based on the page of the original English version) and get the corresponding modern reference.
    - Search for modern references and get the paragraphs in two languages ​​at the same time.
    - Search an entire file for previous references.
    - Add in a whole file the text of any reference found in a specific language. This allows to automate translations in a faster way.
