<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> October has been the month of the return of the cold :snowflake:, the wind :umbrella:, and schoolwork :school_satchel:. It hasn't been a very productive month at Urantiapedia :disappointed:. Many other occupations have left us little free time to dedicate to the project. But, hey, we are always moving forward even if it is little by little. :walking:

## :page_with_curl: Articles

We have uploaded two new publications that have their original in English:
- [Spiritual Fellowship Journal](/en/index/articles_spiritual_fellowship_journal), from the _Christian Fellowship of Students of The Urantia Book_.
- [Study Group Herald](/en/index/articles_study_group_herald), from the _Fellowship_.

This represents the addition of 529 new articles in English in October month. We currently have a total of a little more than 3000 articles in English and more than 600 authors added to Urantiapedia. :open_mouth: :open_mouth:

We are very close to finishing the first major task of the [project phase](/en/help/phases#milestone-ii-books-articles-study-aids-schemas-and-indexes) we are in: the addition of all articles from publications that are originally in English. We hope to complete this task throughout this month of November. You can check in detail everything we plan to add in the [article progress section](/en/help/status#articles-progress-detailed).

Other content that we are uploading little by little are the pages of each author. There we are going to offer some biographical information that usually appears in publications, photographs of the author if we have them, and an index of the works of each author. This month we have updated 60 authors and each month we will add more and more of these pages. For example, if you want to find a list of Richard Bain's works you can do so [here](/en/article/Dick_Bain). These pages are always accessible by clicking on the path that appears below the site header.

## :books: Books

We are beginning to prepare for the second major task of the current phase, which is the addition of many other books in English besides _The Urantia Book_ and _the Bible_. The start of this task will presumably be in December, but we have started to create [the provisional list of all the books](/en/book) that we would like to upload. As you can see from the link, apart from further clarification on the motivation behind this library of books, we have added many more than 600 books to the original list we had. We want to create something unique and special with this library.

## :blue_heart: Presentation at the III Latin American Urantia Congress

From October 26 to 29, the [Third Latin American Congress](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=850310040218609&set=pb.100057188631296.-2207520000&locale=es_LA) _Urantia Book_ readers took place in Mexico. It has been very pleasant to be there and make a presentation to the attendees about the objectives of the project and its current status. From here we send our most esteemed thanks to Fernando Maldonado, who gave the talk, for his always enthusiastic dedication to this project. :clap: :clap:

You already know that if you want to collaborate with us by reviewing machine translations, or are interested in participating in any other way on Urantiapedia, you can send us an email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. :mailbox: We are waiting for you with open arms!

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

Continuing with the information that we began to publish in recent months, here is a summary of the website's indicators.

We observe from the data that the number of users has grown, surely due to the effects of our presentation in Mexico. However, these visits have had a high bounce rate, which indicates that users have entered only to browse the initial pages and nothing more. Nor is the decrease in interaction time encouraging, which has been reduced by half, from 8 to 4 minutes. We assume that all of this is the effects of that passing interest due to the congress in Mexico. One fact that we appreciate, however, is that the number of users in China does not stop growing, and it is already the sixth country that visits Urantiapedia the most, which is surprising considering that we have not yet uploaded any content in Mandarin (although we hope to do so in the not too distant future).
