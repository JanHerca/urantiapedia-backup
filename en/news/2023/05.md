## The Urantia Book in multiple version

Continuing the work done last month, we have expanded the number of languages in which the multiple version of **The Urantia Book** is available. :blue_book: Now in: [Bulgarian](/bg/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Czech](/cs/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Danish](/da/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [German](/de/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Spanish](/es/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Estonian](/et/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Finnish](/fi/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [French](/fr/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Hungarian](/hu/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Indonesian](/id/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Italian](/it/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Lithuanian](/lt/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index) , [Dutch](/nl/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Polish](/pl/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Portuguese](/pt/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Romanian](/ro/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Russian](/ru/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index), [Swedish](/sv/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index) and [Turkish](/tr/The_Urantia_Book_Multiple/Index). Only the Greek, Persian, Hebrew, Japanese and Korean languages remain, which will be updated in the coming weeks.

## Articles

Regarding the articles, :page_with_curl: in the next few days the addition of all the articles of the **Innerface International** magazine will be completed in [English](/en/index/articles_innerface) as well as in [Spanish](/es/index/articles_innerface). This magazine, together with **The Fellowship Herald** magazine, already available in [English](/en/index/articles_herald) and [Spanish](/es/index/articles_herald), make up a total of 769 articles in English, and the same number in Spanish.

But this is only the beginning of all the content related to articles that we want to add to Urantiapedia. In the coming months we will upload many other publications or works available on the Web. We expect this task of adding all articles and papers in English and Spanish to be completed by the end of the third quarter of the year.

## Tribute to Michael of Nebadon in the Jubilee of Jubilees

[May 18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_1) is an appointed date for [all of us who believe](/en/article/Joshua_J_Wilson/Proclaim_the_Holyday_of_Holydays) in our beloved blue book. :blue_heart: On such a day 1993 years ago Jesus of Nazareth, Michael of Nebadon, [began his ascension](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_5) to the Father to receive his [enthronement](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_5) as undisputed sovereign over all his local creation, what is considered a “jubilee of jubilees”, a day of special celebration in an entire universe.

It has become the custom every year in the community of readers of _The Urantia Book_ to celebrate this very important day for the Master and for all of us his children with a moment of socialization and worship. From Urantiapedia we wanted to participate in this celebration by updating the topic index page on [Michael of Nebadon](/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon) as a tribute to him. The page is by no means finished, but it is a first version that we want to extend in the same way to the rest of the cataloged topics. This work in an ongoing process that is expected to be completed in English and Spanish during the second quarter of next year.
