<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> I don't remember being so hot in the month of August :sun_with_face: :hotsprings: :sweat: . This last month has been a real suffocation. Even so, at Urantiapedia we do not rest even under a scorching sun. This is the summary of all the news of the month.

## :wrench: New translation app

I am pleased to announce that we have available within _Urantiapedia Tools_ a new application that helps with translations. This application is one of the milestones that the project had marked on its roadmap from the beginning (see [Milestone III of the project](/en/help/phases#milestone-iii-translator)), and represents a mark of completion that we can place in this task. :heavy_check_mark:

The initial idea of ​​this phase of the project was to create two tools, one to be added into _Urantiapedia Tools_, which allows high-speed translation of hundreds of pages, and another to be added into [Wiji.js](https://js.wiki/) (the software that runs the Urantiapedia website), in order to have a translation system within the website itself, and that can translate the page that is open.

Since currently the number of edits made directly from the website is very low, we have prioritized the creation of the translator that works within _Urantiapedia Tools_. The great usefulness of this application is that it allows all of the following:
- Connect to Google Cloud translation services (requires installing Google Cloud CLI for authentication and having a Google Cloud account for billing).
- Send hundreds of pages at a time and translate them by creating the same initial folder structure in a destination folder.
- Maintains the integrity of style and format of the pages. At the moment it only supports the translation of pages in [Markdown](/en/help/markdown) format, but it supports the inclusion of certain HTML tags and even LaTeX content.
- Avoid sending text that does not have to be translated to Google Translate, reducing the characters to be translated by up to 25%. For example, quotes from _The Urantia Book_ are not sent to Google Translate but rather a mark is placed which is then replaced by the existing translation. :clap:
- Allows you to make prior estimates of the total number of characters and sent ones to Google, to evaluate the cost, which in Google is always a function of the number of characters sent. This also allows you to verify that Google billing is correct.
- Make subsequent corrections to Google translation. For example, some punctuation marks or quotation marks often fail in translations and their correction has been automated here. As more translations are made and more problems are detected, they can be added to the application so that they no longer occur in the result.

Two important considerations of this new application:
- The quality of the translation has been proven to be much higher than using the free access that Google offers for translations, such as [Google Translator](https://translate.google.com/). This significantly reduces the review time needed.
- This application performs the same functions as [GT4T](http://gt4t.net/) application, a very powerful and capable software based on the same premise as what has been developed within _Urantiapedia Tools_. The good news is that we will no longer need to use GT4T, saving the part of expenses that we had budgeted for this software, and being able to dedicate that amount of money to carry out more translations.

We couldn't be happier and more satisfied with this new addition to the project, which will undoubtedly speed up and improve translations a lot. :relaxed:

## :page_with_curl: Articles

* The Fellowship's [Mighty Messenger](/en/index/articles_mighty_messenger) magazine has been revised, both in English and Spanish, correcting a good number of errors.
* We have added all the poems that appear in the magazine [Fellowship Herald](/en/index/articles_herald), in the issues of the magazine that had them, both in English and Spanish. Now the magazine is complete and contains everything that the original contains.
* We have used the new _Urantiapedia Tools_ translation application to test it by translating the magazine [Luz y Vida](/en/index/articles_luz_y_vida) from Spanish to English. This has helped us not only to improve the software but also to make this magazine available to English-speaking readers.
* We have begun the work of adding Urantia Foundation publications, beginning with [News Online](/en/index/articles), which will be followed by _NewsFlash!_ and _Urantian News_. We hope to have all of these publications available in English within the next month.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

Continuing with the information we started publishing last month, here is a summary of the website's indicators.

Compared to previous month, the number of page visits has increased and has stabilized around 1,000 monthly sessions, which predicts approximately 12,000 annual sessions. We are still far from our goal of more than 30,000 sessions per year but the rest of the parameters are promising. We continue to have a high number of new users, the interaction time is maintained, and the countries from which Urantiapedia is accessed are beginning to diversify. China now appears among the list of the most visited countries, which is interesting and encourages us to try to add content in Chinese as soon as possible.
