<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month of July we have dedicated a bit to rest, enjoy a short vacation and be with the family :sunrise: :tropical_drink: :family:. Even so, there has always been a gap to move forward in our long list of tasks :card_index:. Do you want to know what we have done? Here you have our punctual summary of news on Urantiapedia. :wink:

## The Urantia Book

Regarding our beloved blue book :blue_book:, this month we have corrected some long-standing typographical errors in some documents in the Spanish language. These were words that appeared incorrectly joined, probably due to some faulty import process. It's finally fixed :wrench:.

Undoubtedly the most notable addition to _The Urantia Book_ this month is that all documents now contain a revamped [References](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#references) section, with several subsections. We have now added a new list of links from the book to articles that mention each paragraph :clap: :clap:. At the moment these links are available for the book in English and Spanish. When we translate the articles into other languages, we will add the links to them as well.

This represents a good example of what we intend to achieve with Urantiapedia. All contents will be linked to _The Urantia Book_ in a bi-directional way. This opens enormous new possibilities to make a much more comprehensive reading of the book.

We have posted a video on Youtube explaining these improvements. You can access the video here [in English](https://youtu.be/m-efK0fbtw4) and here [in Spanish](https://youtu.be/QfVHUxpPrjA).

## Legal information

During this month we have updated the legal information :copyright:, and not only [in English](/en/license) but in all languages, as it contained numerous inconsistencies with respect to the original in English. Although careful translation into each language has been attempted, errors may still exist. If there is any error, we recommend that you refer to the legal information [in English](/en/license), which is the original source of this documentation and the one that has final validity in case of discrepancies.

We would like to emphasize from here that, with the due exceptions of those contents that are subject to third party copyright, all the content of Urantiapedia will be offered under the license [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.es), which grants great freedom of use :sparkling_heart:.

Legal information is always accessible from the left side menu, at the bottom of the menu. If any content is subject to third party copyright, we are updating all pages of the site so that a prominent mention of the copyright holders appears at the top of each page.

## Articles

The magazine [Luz y Vida](/es/index/articles_luz_y_vida) of the [Urantia Association of Spain](https://aue.urantia-association.org/) is available on Urantiapedia. This is a publication in Spanish that began as a quarterly back in 2005 and is now a monthly newsletter. It has had over sixty :open_mouth: issues during this time. In it you can find very useful works that will now be connected to _The Urantia Book_ directly within Urantiapedia. Next month we will translate all issues into English and start using Google's cloud translation system to speed up these translations and improve their quality. :+1:

A group of collaborators, to whom we send our thanks from here, are helping us detect errors in the translations into Spanish and French of articles from other publications such as the [Fellowship Herald](/en/index/articles_herald) and the [Mighty Messenger](/en/index/articles_mighty_messenger). We want to improve the quality of translations and for this we are going to start using Google software to go beyond the quality offered by this company's free software.

## New planning

During this time that we have worked on uploading articles we have also done an exhaustive search for publications related to _The Urantia Book_. The number of magazines, newsletters, blogs and other web pages that we are finding is more and more numerous. There is a huge amount of content that has been created in different languages ​​since _The Urantia Book_ was first published in 1955.

The project [Urantia Book Historical Society](https://ubhs.hosted-by-files.com/http/DocTypesIndex.html) has been key in this prospecting work, whose sponsors we are infinitely grateful for their efforts. This project contains a vast amount of scanned documentation related to organizations related to _The Urantia Book_. This is a public project that is making possible for us to consider uploading a lot of content to Urantiapedia.

Thanks to this project and others like it, we have compiled a [list of resources available on the Internet](/en/help/websites) that continues to grow every month. It is for this reason that we want to modify our planned schedule for the [Mustard Seed Project](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program). The project was scheduled to last four months, from April to July of this year, for the task of uploading to Urantiapedia all existing publications in English. It is obvious that the material that we now intend to upload is much larger than what we had planned, so we want to extend this task for two more months, until September of this year.

This new planning, however, does not imply that the scheduled dates for the rest of the tasks will change, since they can be carried out in parallel, so we do not expect delays in them.

## Collaboration
