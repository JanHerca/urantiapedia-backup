<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> In this month of January and the coming months we will begin to add to Urantiapedia not only content in English, as last year, but we are going to extend the content that already exists in English to Spanish and French. Our goal is that by the end of this year the content will be the same in English, Spanish and French. It is a first step toward our broader goal of building a fully multilingual website where every speaker on the planet can find valuable content to understand _The Urantia Book_ in their own language. :+1: 

These are the new contents for this month: 

## :books: Books 

The creation of the [Urantiapedia Library](/en/book) has begun. This Library will be organized by thematic shelves with various contents that we believe have a close relationship with _The Urantia Book_. As can be seen on the [shelves index page](/en/index/books) these will contain content on world religions, theology, religions in general, philosophy, and science. They will all be books in the public domain and especially from the time before the publication of _The Urantia Book_. 

This last month we have added all the extra-biblical books (deuterocanonical and pseudepigraphal apocrypha) related to the Old Testament, and half of those related to the New Testament, for three languages: 

- English ([Old Testament](/en/index/books_judeo_christianism_ot ) and [New Testament](/en/index/books_judeo_christianism_nt)) 
- Spanish ([Old Testament](/es/index/books_judeo_christianism_ot) and [New Testament](/es/index/books_judeo_christianism_nt)) 
- French ([Old Testament ](/fr/index/books_judeo_christianism_ot) and [New Testament](/fr/index/books_judeo_christianism_nt)) 

Over the next month we will add the remaining books related to the New Testament. We will also begin adding books on other religions, such as Islam (of which we have about 40 books selected) and Buddhism (of which we have a selection of about 70 books).

It is interesting to make a note here about these books, especially the extra-biblical ones. One might think that since they are ancient books, many of them written even before the Christian era, or in the first centuries of the era, editions and translations into many languages ​​should freely circulate without being subject to copyright. The reality is quite disappointing. In some languages, such as Spanish or French (not to mention other languages), concern for the translation of these texts has been very low, which is why most of the translations are very recent and are still subject to rights. English is perhaps the language that has received the most translations of all these early writings, which is why there are copyright-free versions in English, but not in other languages, of many biblical apocrypha and much Eastern religious literature. Due to this situation, and to avoid incurring legal problems, whenever it has not been possible to find a copyright-free edition in a language, we have tried to make a translation that is as correct as possible from an already existing version in a modern language (normally in English). It must be noted that this situation of commercialism that exists in the academic field regarding ancient religious writings is deplorable. :unamused: The situation of the Bible is especially sad. Frequent editions are made of it in which the contents barely vary compared to older editions with the sole purpose of blocking these editions through copyright. And so we find ourselves with a situation in which it is quite difficult to obtain editions of these very old texts without incurring some type of legal risk. 

As the Library is added we will be able to create links between _The Urantia Book_ or other Urantiapedia content and those books in the same way that we now have _Paramony_ added, the links between biblical passages and paragraphs of _The Urantia Book_. Having everything integrated into a single website without having to resort to other external pages to access this content will greatly facilitate the work of understanding and studying _The Urantia Book_. 

## :page_with_curl: Articles 

This last month we have added the translation into [Spanish](/es/index/articles_606) and [French](/fr/index/articles_606) of the Australian publication «6-0-6», a newsletter published for many years by the [Australia and New Zealand _Urantia Book_ Association (ANZURA)](https://anzura.urantia-association.org/) and which has never received a translation into other languages.

In the coming months, translations of many more publications that are currently only available in English will be added. Some publications of the [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/) or the [Urantia Book Fellowship](https://urantiabook.org/) have received translations into some languages, in which case we will incorporate them as they are already. 

## Statistics 

This last month all the indicators have shot up very significantly. :clap: :clap: The number of users and sessions have been the highest to date, although it is worrying that the recurrence rate is still around 25%, which indicates that very few users return to the website . However, the average interaction time, close to 8 minutes, is the highest we have ever had, and indicates that those who enter the page really spend a long time reading and using the content. We believe that this is the progressive effect of a growth in content, and it makes us assume that the statistics will improve drastically when at the end of this year practically all the content that we have planned for the English, Spanish and French languages will be added, three languages ​​that alone they cover [925 million native-speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers), without forgetting that there are more than [one billion who speak English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers) as their second language.
