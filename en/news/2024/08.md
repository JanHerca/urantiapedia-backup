<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> For another month, the French language :fr: has been our focus. We have now managed to bring French into line with the other two languages ​​(English and Spanish) on which we are concentrating our efforts, at least for the [Urantiapedia Newspaper Archive](/en/article) part. Let's get to the details.

## :page_with_curl: Articles (The Urantiapedia Newsletter Archive)

Articles uploaded this month:

- [Tidings](/en/index/articles_iua_tidings), from Urantia Association International. In addition to posting this newsletter in French, we have also corrected many errors in the English and Spanish versions.
- [The Arena](/en/index/articles_arena), from the Urantia Association of Australia and New Zealand. Again, not only have we uploaded the newsletter in French, but we have also corrected errors in the other languages.
- [Réflectivité](/fr/index/articles_reflectivite), from the Urantia Association of Quebec. We have only uploaded half of all the articles planned so far, and only in French. We will continue to upload the remaining articles in all languages ​​during this month of September.
- [New Online](/en/index/articles_uf_news_online). This Urantia Foundation publication has undergone a style and formatting revision, correcting many errors.
- [UBAnnotated and UBTheNews](/en/index/articles_ubannotated), a project of Halbert Katzen, an avid reader of _The Urantia Book_. A large portion of the articles Halbert publishes on [his website](https://ubannotated.com/) have been added to Urantiapedia and are now available (for the first time) in Spanish and French in addition to English. In total, more than 50 articles have been uploaded on all kinds of topics related to _The Urantia Book_.

We are very close to completing one of the [milestones](/en/help/phases) :triangular_flag_on_post: that we set for ourselves with the Urantiapedia project, the creation of a [Newspaper Library on _The Urantia Book_](/en/article) that would contain a good number of articles from different publications and websites :clap: :clap:. This milestone is also included in the list of tasks and goals that we plan to carry out as part of the project presented to the [Mustard Seed Program](https://www.urantia.org/about-us/what-we-do/mustard-seed-grants-program) of the [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/). We hope to finally complete these tasks during this month of September, which will be a big step for Urantiapedia, after more than two years of uploading content. The final number of articles that Urantiapedia will contain in each language will be close to 5,000.

Once we finish the Newspaper Library, that won't be the end of this part of Urantiapedia, far from it. There are many other websites and publications that are on our radar and we want to upload all of those as well. But that will be a goal for next year and beyond, because once this first version of the Newspaper Library is completed, we will continue with two other great elements of Urantiapedia: the [Urantiapedia Library](/en/book) and the [The Urantia Book Encyclopedia](/en/topic). :+1:

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Readers' Books (Urantiapedia Library)

We have uploaded Halbert Katzen's book [Eugenics, Races and The Urantia Book](/en/book/Halbert_Katzen/Eugenics_Race_and_The_Urantia_Book) in French, making it now available in the three languages ​​we are working with. In addition, minor errors have been corrected in the Spanish and English versions.

We are continuing to work on a book by David Kantor on the Urantia movement, which will finally be available next month, as well as on Jan Herca's novel about Jesus of Nazareth.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

We see a decline in all the parameters we measure, although in line with what has been the case in previous months, since if we look back over the last few months the page had grown spectacularly. One possible explanation may be that the addition of French content, which has been our focus this past month and the previous one, does not translate as much into new visits or the permanence of visitors as other languages ​​such as English or Spanish. To put the most used languages ​​into context, three quarters (78%) of Urantiapedia visitors are from English or Spanish speaking countries. The rest is shared by other languages, among which we have French, German, Turkish, Greek, Italian and Portuguese speaking users, to mention the ones with the largest numbers. In order for these statistics to be reflected in the monthly news, from now on we will add one more parameter to the table below (languages ​​of the users with the most visits).
