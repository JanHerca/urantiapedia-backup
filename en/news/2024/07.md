<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> We’re still focusing on the French language, which is close to matching the content of English and Spanish. This month has also been a bit of a rest month :sunny: :beer: :sunrise_over_mountains: so there haven’t been as many additions as other months.

## :page_with_curl: Articles

Articles in French uploaded during this month:

- [Journal](/fr/index/articles_iua_journal), from the Urantia Association International. In addition to adding this publication in French, we have also added the latest issues available in English, Spanish, and French. We are also gradually adding all the old issues of this publication in the three languages. For now, the years that are available are from 1995 to 2000, and from 2016 to the present. In the coming months we will add the rest of the missing years. Obtaining these old issues (and also in English, Spanish, and French) is not an easy task. In some cases we have only obtained the newsletter in one or two of the languages, and the missing languages ​​have been obtained through our own translation. There has been no way to obtain some issues, such as the ones indicated: March and June - 1995; December - 1996; June, September, and December - 1997; December - 2002; September - 2004; March - 2005; December - 2011. We have obtained all the issues for the rest (4 issues each year between 1995 and 2015). If you are reading this and can provide us with any of the missing issues, please send them to urantiapedia@gmail.com. We would be grateful. 
- Please also note that we have made numerous corrections to the existing French articles, particularly regarding blank spaces and other strange characters.
- Finally, the [Publication Mandate](/fr/article/The_Publication_Mandate), which was already available in [English](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) and [Spanish](/es/article/The_Publication_Mandate), has been added in French, and the references to this document have been updated so that they are now always hyperlinked.

We have begun plans to upload publications that were originally only in French, such as [Le Lien](http://lien.urantia.fr/) (from the French Urantia Association) or [Reflectivité](https://www.urantia-quebec.ca/publications/reflectivite) (from the Quebec Urantia Association). For other publications, such as L'Agondontaire, L'Ascendeur, or La Lettre, we will try to locate old issues to try to digitize and upload them, but it will be an arduous task. There is a [magnificent document explaining the history](http://lien.urantia.fr/100supplement.pdf) of these French publications, which are in essence pure history of the Urantia movement, going back as early as 1976.


## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

The number of users continues to increase each month, which is a good indication. For the first time in a month, Urantiapedia has had more than 2,000 different users visiting the site at least once. Despite this positive figure, the other values ​​have slightly worsened, such as the average interaction time or the bounce rate. We hope that these figures will show a positive trend again in the coming months, since the interaction time is what really indicates whether users find the content of the website interesting and stay on it or not. We will keep an eye on these developments.

We are amazed—and would like to highlight here— by the strong entry of Nigeria in the statistics. It is a country with a wide use of English, but it is remarkable that many Urantiapedia users are Nigerians ahead of British, Canadians or Australians. Bravo, Nigeria! :clap: :clap:
