<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> Here we are for another month with the news on Urantiapedia. :mega:

## :page_with_curl: Articles 

Articles in Spanish uploaded during this month: 

- [The Urantian](/es/index/articles_the_urantian), from the Fellowship. 
- [Journal](/es/index/articles_iua_journal) and [Tidings](/es/index/articles_iua_tidings), from the International Urantia Association. 

In total there are more than 700 articles. :clap: 

## :notebook: Study Aids 

We are actively working to finish incorporating all the Study Aids that we have compiled, which total around 50. These works usually exceed 100 pages in many cases, are extensive works, and contain many quotes from _The Urantia Book_ or diagrams and illustrations that make them difficult to upload to Urantiapedia. 

This work, of course, is being done in [English](/en/index/study_aids), [Spanish](/es/index/study_aids) and [French](/fr/index/study_aids) at the moment. 

This month we have uploaded a good number of aids in Spanish, but we are not going to stop there and in the coming months we will not stop growing this section until we complete the planned objective. 

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics 

Spectacular growth in the number of users during the month of May! It has undoubtedly been the month with the best statistics since we started collecting them. The total number of users has increased by **more than double**, and the number of returning users has also doubled. Although the average interaction time has dropped a little, this is undoubtedly very good news. The data is even better if we consider that many users who have entered Urantiapedia for the first time this month have done so from countries such as Germany, Sweden or Brazil, despite the fact that the content in their languages ​​is very limited. Also striking is the enormous increase in use from Mexico, where the number of users has increased by more than 200%. 

This certainly reinforces our desire to help the community of _The Urantia Book_ readers with much more content that we hope will appear very soon and be available in as many languages ​​as possible.
