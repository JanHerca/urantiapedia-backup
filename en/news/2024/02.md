<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been shorter and has given less time to add things than other months. :sweat_smile: The plan was to add content in the form of articles and books every month, but this month we had to focus only on the articles. The idea is to finish at least each month with a block of things and then move on to another block and not leave things half done. :construction: 

These are the new contents of this month: 

## :page_with_curl: Articles 

In this last month we have completed the addition of [“News Online” from Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-12). They are now available in [English](/en/index/articles_uf_news_online), [Spanish](/es/index/articles_uf_news_online) and [French](/fr/index/articles_uf_news_online). This includes all the issues that have appeared from 2007 to the last one published in 2023. 

It may seem like little work for a whole month but it is good to remember here what is being done when adding existing publications: 
- In the case of _News Online from the Urantia Foundation_ we are talking about 640 pages in total (articles) for each language, which is almost 2000 pages in the three languages ​​​​in which it has been added. 
- When we add an article we are not merely copying and pasting from the original web page. A series of extra actions are carried out: 
  - The content is converted to [Markdown](/en/help/markdown) format, which allows for more compactness and easier editing than the HTML format. 
  - Internal links to _The Urantia Book_ of Urantiapedia are created from any mention that appears in a paragraph. These links are then used to include a list of references that allow you to know which articles each paragraph mentions. 
  - Internal links to the _Bible_ are also created every time a Bible quote is detected. 
  - The style is standardized (headers, quotations, footnotes, tables, images, etc.) so that everything has a similar appearance and is easy to recognize in the entire Urantiapedia. 
  - Images are converted into responsive elements that are repositioned appropriately according to the width of the reading device. 
  - Each item is cataloged using tags. 
  - Copyright information is added. 
  - Links are included to the pages where you can obtain the sources.
  - Navigation elements are added to be able to go from one article to the next within the same publication. 
  - It is properly indexed in the Database, so that later searches can be made within the articles. 
- Sometimes errors or typos in the originals are corrected if they are notorious, such as an incomplete paragraph, or an untranslated photo caption, etc. 
- We try to complete any number or article that may be missing in a language and be as rigorous as possible in ensuring that it is the same in all languages, at least in the three on which the project currently focuses (English, Spanish and French) . 
- Everything is published openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup). There is nothing in this project that is privately on the server or on disks in the cloud. The entire Urantipedia is accessible on GitHub. We not only publish the [Urantiapedia as it is on the website](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup), but also all the intermediate files we used to create the website and [all the source code of the applications](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) that we are developing to speed up the work. :+1: :+1: Thanks to this, anyone who wants can send us modifications using the GitHub platform. It does not require any permission on our part, and the Urantiapedia administrator team can then safely accept or reject those submitted changes. 

As you can see, adding articles is perhaps the most laborious job of all those planned for this project. We want to create a [Urantia Book Newspaper Library](/en/index/articles) that includes as many publications as possible, both official from different organizations and from individuals. We want to make all these publications available to the world and the community of readers in a homogeneous, cohesive and connected way with _The Urantia Book_, in a way that facilitates its reading and understanding. It is going to be a long and laborious work that we hope will continue for a few more months to complete a number of [publications that we have planned](/en/help/status#articles-progress-detailed). And even when we finish all that work, we're sure we'll be at the starting point for much more future content. 

## Statistics

The statistics clearly show an important increase in the number of users, the largest recorded to date, along with a significant increase in the average interaction time, above 9 minutes. This confirms what we already assumed. As Urantiapedia's content grows, not only in its length but also in the number of languages ​​supported, many more users will find content of interest and will be encouraged to use the website. All of this greatly motivates us to continue expanding the content.
