<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> This month we're focusing on the French language again. There's a lot of content we already have in English and Spanish, but we want to match that content in the French language as well. So here's what's new this month.

## :page_with_curl: Articles

French articles uploaded during this month:

- [Fellowship Herald](/fr/index/articles_herald), from the Fellowship. In addition to adding this publication in French, we have also added the latest available issues, translating where necessary. This publication is now available in full in English, Spanish and French.
- Other Fellowship publications: [The Urantian](/fr/index/articles_the_urantian), [Mighty Messenger](/fr/index/articles_mighty_messenger), and [Study Group Herald](/fr/index/articles_study_group_herald), are now fully uploaded and available in English, Spanish, and French.
- [Urantian News](/fr/index/articles_uf_urantian), the former paper publication of Urantia Foundation, is also up and available in English, Spanish, and French.

In total, there are nearly 1000 articles uploaded this month. :astonished: :astonished:

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Readers' books

We have corrected a book by Dr. Ken Glasziou that was incorrectly added, and have also made it available for the three standard languages: English, Spanish and French. You can read it here: [Science, Anthropology and Archaeology in The Urantia Book](/en/book/Ken_Glasziou/Science_Anthropology_and_Archaeology_in_The_Urantia_Book).

Jan Herca's novel, “Jesus of Nazareth”, is being added little by little, although there is no volume available yet. A reissue is being done, correcting numerous paragraphs, and republishing the articles that come with the novel. You can read the articles [here](/es/index/articles_jan_herca), for the moment only in Spanish, although we will extend them to other languages ​​in the near future.

Finally, we are slowly uploading the book “Historic Timeline of Events in the Urantia Community” by David Kantor. This book, available online on the Fellowship website, contains numerous references to various documents related to the institutions and prominent individuals of the Urantia movement. We want all of this supporting documentation to also be part of Urantiapedia so it will take some extra time to have this book on our website in English, Spanish, and French.

## :books: Other books

There are two books that have quietly arrived at Urantiapedia. They are books that for various reasons we are using to test certain book addition processes that we will use extensively in the future. There is no extra reason. They are books like any other that we hope to be able to add very quickly to the Urantiapedia Library within a few months.

The books are currently only available in English:

- [A college Text-book of Geology](/en/book/Thomas_C_Chamberlin_and_Rollin_D_Salisbury/A_College_Textbook_of_Geology), by Thomas C. Chamberlin and Rollin D. Salisbury.
- [The Mind at Mischief](/en/book/William_S_Sadler/The_Mind_at_Mischief), by William S. Sadler.

Sadler's book is a book of special interest to readers of _The Urantia Book_ because it is considered to contain, in its Appendix, the first mention (albeit not explicit) of the process by which the revelation came to be.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

The number of users on Urantiapedia continues to grow! All statistics continue to improve each month, which is a sign that the increase in content and the variety of languages ​​have a clear positive effect on these numbers. This encourages us to continue adding many more things that we have planned, and to aim to create a multilingual website that can be useful to as many people around the world as possible.
