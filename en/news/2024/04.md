## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: The novel project «Jesus of Nazareth»

This project, which we already introduced in the news of [previous month](/en/news/2024/03), has begun little by little. At the moment the two existing volumes and the articles that accompany them are being added to Urantiapedia. This task is in progress and while it is being carried out, a review and correction of the original text is being made. More news about this project will appear in the coming months.
