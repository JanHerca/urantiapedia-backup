<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Work has continued during this one more or less normally. This month we have proceeded to generate the necessary files to have all the footnotes of _The Urantia Book_ that cross it with the _Bible_, as well as the books of the _Bible_. :relaxed: :thumbsup:

## New content

- The website is not yet available. In the content part, we continue to upload content directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia).
- The files [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [Wikitext](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikitext/en) of _The Urantia Book_ have been generated :blue_book: with all the footnotes linking it to the _Bible_. We already explained what these formats consist of in the news of [last month](/es/news/2020/07).
- The preparation of the books of the _Bible_ in [LaTeX] format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) has started. The version of the Bible that is being used is the so-called “Reina Valera” from 1960, one of the translations of the Bible into Spanish in the public domain.
- All content for now is only in Spanish.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- We have been improving the manuals for collaborators, the so-called HOWTOs.
