<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> On January 10, 2020 we have started this journey of Urantiapedia :star2: :rocket:. There have been several months evaluating the possibility of creating a good part of its content in an automated way. We have seen that it is feasible and finally the project is launched. :runner: 

## :sparkles:New content

- The website is not yet available. In the content part, we have only proceeded to upload the initial input files to [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia). 
- For _The Urantia Book_ :blue_book: we have started from some files in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) format (*.tex) that had previously been used to try to create an advanced version of the book on paper. These files have been generated from the official HTML version downloadable from the [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/).
- For the Topic Index part, we have started the conversion to a TXT format of the [Urantia Fellowship index](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/topical_index/index.htm). A spreadsheet has also been generated to plan the work on the topics, and some topics that start with the letters [A](/en/index/topics#a) and [M](/en/index/topics#m) have been corrected. 
- For cross references between the _Bible_ and _The Urantia Book_, we have started to include the [Paramony](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/paramony/), an existing listing created by Duane Faw, a reader from the book. 
- All content for now is only in Spanish. 

## :wrench: Urantiapedia Tools

- The first version of _Urantiapedia Tools_ has been added, called _UBSearch_, which is initially developed in C#. Added functionality for reading Topic Index files and the Mediawiki's [Wikitext](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikitext/en) converter. 
- The first version of the manuals for collaborators, initially called HOWTO, are added.
