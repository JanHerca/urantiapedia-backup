<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month we have continued the work with the [Topic Index](/en/index/topics). There is a lot of work ahead on this part, so it is expected that there will be no significant changes to the website for several months. :hourglass_flowing_sand:

## New content

- We continue adding the Topic Index in English and Spanish, introducing corrections where errors are detected. The entire Topic Index is being created using a simple TXT format with the topics organized alphabetically and one file for each letter of the alphabet.
