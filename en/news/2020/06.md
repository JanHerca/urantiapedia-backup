## New content

- The website is not yet available. In the content part, we continue to upload content directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia).
- The files of _The Urantia Book_ have been generated in JSON and in Wikitext. See below about these two formats.
- We continue to include cross-references between the _Bible_ and _The Urantia Book_, the [Paramony](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/paramony/), an existing listing created by Duane Faw, a reader of the book.
- All content for now is only in Spanish.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- Seeing the complexity that the _Urantiapedia Tools_ will finally have, it has been decided to start a migration of the code from C# to Javascript, and use [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as a desktop execution environment. Using Javascript, which is a very fast language for coding, we will be able to streamline all developments, and also, as it is a web-compatible code, be able to reuse it in the future on the web page itself.
- Added the [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) format converter from _The Urantia Book_ to a intermediate [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format, which will be more comfortable to handle addition of cross-references into it.
- The converter of _The Urantia Book_ from JSON format to Wikitext format has been added. This format is the one used by [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the Wikipedia software, and that we will also use on Urantiapedia. This converter also adds the Paramony footnotes in the process.
