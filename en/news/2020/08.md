<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been a month of light rest and vacations. :tent: Still, we keep on beating the drum. The addition of the Bible is apace and the Urantiapedia is becoming bilingual! Until now all the content was being in Spanish. Of course, the goal is to be multi-language :globe_with_meridians: in the future, so we'll be testing these capabilities with at least two languages, Spanish and English. :ok_hand: :heavy_check_mark:

## New content

- The website is not yet available. In the content part, we continue to upload content directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia). :octocat:
- We have started the addition of the Topic Index in English.
- The preparation of the books of the _Bible_ in [LaTeX] format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) continues. The version of the Bible that is being used is the so-called “Reina Valera” from 1960, one of the translations of the Bible into Spanish in the public domain.

## Urantiapedia Tools

- We have been improving the manuals for collaborators, the so-called HOWTOs.
