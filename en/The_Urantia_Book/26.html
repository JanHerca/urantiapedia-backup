<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_1">26:1.1</a></small></sup>  Angels are the ministering-spirit associates of the evolutionary and ascending will creatures of all space; they are also the colleagues and working associates of the higher hosts of the divine personalities of the spheres. The <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of all orders are distinct personalities and are highly individualized. They all have a large capacity for appreciation of the ministrations of the <a href="/en/topic/reversion_directors">reversion directors</a>. Together with the <a href="/en/topic/Messenger_Hosts_of_Space">Messenger Hosts of Space</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> enjoy seasons of rest and change; they possess very social natures and have an associative capacity far transcending that of human beings.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_2">26:1.2</a></small></sup>  The ministering spirits of the grand universe are classified as follows:</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_3">26:1.3</a></small></sup>  1. Supernaphim.</p>

<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_9">26:1.9</a></small></sup>  7. Midway Creatures.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_10">26:1.10</a></small></sup>  The individual members of the angelic orders are not altogether stationary as to personal status in the universe. Angels of certain orders may become <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Companions">Paradise Companions</a> for a season; some become <a href="/en/topic/Celestial_Recorders">Celestial Recorders</a>; others ascend to the ranks of the <a href="/en/topic/Technical_Advisers">Technical Advisers</a>. Certain of the <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a> may aspire to seraphic status and destiny, while evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> can achieve the spiritual levels of the ascending <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_11">26:1.11</a></small></sup>  The seven orders of <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a>, as revealed, are grouped for presentation in accordance with their functions of greatest importance to ascending creatures:</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_12">26:1.12</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The Ministering Spirits of the Central Universe.</i> The three orders of <i><a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a></i> serve in the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a>. Primary or <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> supernaphim are created by the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. The secondary and tertiary orders, serving in <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, are respectively the offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits and of the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Spirits_of_Havona_Circuits">Spirits of the Circuits</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_13">26:1.13</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The Ministering Spirits of the Superuniverses‚Äî</i>the <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/tertiaphim">tertiaphim</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/omniaphim">omniaphim</a>. <i>Seconaphim,</i> the children of the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a>, variously serve in the seven superuniverses. <i>Tertiaphim,</i> of origin in the Infinite Spirit, are eventually dedicated to the liaison service of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>. <i>Omniaphim</i> are created concertedly by the Infinite Spirit and the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Supreme_Executives">Seven Supreme Executives</a>, and they are the exclusive servants of the latter. The discussion of these three orders forms the subject of a succeeding narrative in this series.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_14">26:1.14</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The Ministering Spirits of the Local Universes</i> embrace the <i><a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a></i> and their assistants, the <i><a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a>.</i> With these offspring of a Universe Mother Spirit mortal <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> have initial contact. The <i>midway creatures,</i> of nativity on the inhabited worlds, are not really of the angelic orders proper, though often functionally grouped with the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a>. Their <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a>, with an account of the seraphim and cherubim, is presented in those papers dealing with the affairs of your local universe.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_15">26:1.15</a></small></sup>  All orders of the angelic hosts are devoted to the various universe services, and they minister in one way or another to the higher orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a>; but it is the <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, and seraphim who, in large numbers, are employed in the furtherance of the ascending scheme of progressive perfection for the children of time. Functioning in the central, super-, and local universes, they form that unbroken chain of spirit ministers which has been provided by the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> for the help and guidance of all who seek to attain the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> through the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_16">26:1.16</a></small></sup>  Supernaphim are limited in ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a> <a href="/en/topic/polarity">polarity</a>‚Äù regarding only one phase of action, that with the Universal Father. They can work singly except when directly employing the exclusive circuits of the Father. When they are in power reception on the Father‚Äôs direct ministry, supernaphim must voluntarily associate in pairs to be able to function. Seconaphim are likewise limited and in addition must work in pairs in order to synchronize with the circuits of the Eternal Son. Seraphim can work singly as discrete and localized personalities, but they are able to encircuit only when polarized as liaison pairs. When such spirit beings are associated as pairs, the one is spoken of as <a href="/en/topic/complemental_relationships">complemental</a> to the other. Complemental relationships may be transient; they are not necessarily of a permanent nature.</p>
<p id="p1_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p1_17">26:1.17</a></small></sup>  These <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">brilliant creatures</a> of light are sustained directly by the intake of the spiritual energy of the primary <a href="/en/topic/circuits">circuits</a> of the universe. <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> must obtain light-energy through the vegetative incarnation, but the angelic hosts are encircuited; they ‚Äúhave food that you know not<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.‚Äù They also partake of the circulating teachings of the marvelous <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a>; they have a reception of knowledge and an intake of wisdom much resembling their technique of assimilating the life energies.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. THE MIGHTY SUPERNAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_1">26:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> are the skilled ministers to all types of beings who sojourn on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and in the central universe. These high <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> are created in three major orders: primary, secondary, and tertiary.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_2">26:2.2</a></small></sup>  <i>Primary supernaphim</i> are the exclusive offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Creator">Conjoint Creator</a>. They divide their ministry about equally between certain groups of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a> and the ever-enlarging corps of ascendant pilgrims. These angels of the eternal Isle are highly efficacious in furthering the essential training of both groups of Paradise dwellers. They contribute much that is helpful to the mutual understanding of these two unique orders of universe creatures‚Äîthe one being the highest type of divine and perfect will creature, and the other, the perfected evolution of the lowest type of will creature in all the universe of universes.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_3">26:2.3</a></small></sup>  The work of the primary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> is so unique and distinctive that it will be separately considered in the succeeding narrative.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_4">26:2.4</a></small></sup>  <i>Secondary supernaphim</i> are the directors of the affairs of ascending beings on the seven circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>. They are equally concerned in ministering to the educational training of numerous orders of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a> who sojourn for long periods on the world circuits of the central creation, but we may not discuss this phase of their service.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_5">26:2.5</a></small></sup>  There are seven types of these high <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, each of origin in one of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> and in nature patterned accordingly. Collectively, the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits create many different groups of unique beings and entities, and the individual members of each order are comparatively uniform in nature. But when these same Seven Spirits create individually, the resulting orders are always sevenfold in nature; the children of each Master Spirit partake of the nature of their creator and are accordingly diverse from the others. Such is the origin of the secondary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, and the angels of all seven created types function in all channels of activity open to their entire order, chiefly on the seven circuits of the central and divine universe.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_6">26:2.6</a></small></sup>  Each of the seven planetary circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is under the direct supervision of one of the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Spirits_of_Havona_Circuits">Seven Spirits of the Circuits</a>, themselves the collective‚Äîhence uniform‚Äîcreation of the Seven Master Spirits. Though partaking of the nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a>, these seven subsidiary Spirits of Havona were not a part of the original pattern universe. They were in function after the original (eternal) creation but long before the times of <a href="/en/topic/Grandfanda">Grandfanda</a>. They undoubtedly appeared as a creative response of the Master Spirits to the emerging purpose of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being, and they were discovered in function upon the organization of the grand universe. The <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and all his creative associates, as universal co-ordinators, seem abundantly endowed with the ability to make suitable creative responses to the simultaneous developments in the experiential Deities and in the evolving universes.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p2_7">26:2.7</a></small></sup>  <i>Tertiary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a></i> take origin in these Seven Spirits of the Circuits. Each one of them, on the separate Havona circles, is empowered by the Infinite Spirit to create a sufficient number of high superaphic ministers of the tertiary order to meet the needs of the central universe. While the Circuit Spirits produced comparatively few of these angelic ministers prior to the arrival in Havona of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> did not even begin the creation of secondary supernaphim until the landing of Grandfanda. As the older of the two orders, the tertiary supernaphim will therefore receive first consideration.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. THE TERTIARY SUPERNAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_1">26:3.1</a></small></sup>  These servants of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> are the angelic specialists of the various circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, and their ministry extends to both the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> of time and the descending pilgrims of eternity. On the billion study worlds of the perfect central creation, your superaphic associates of all orders will be fully visible to you. There you will all be, in the highest sense, fraternal and understanding beings of mutual contact and sympathy. You will also fully recognize and exquisitely fraternize with the descending pilgrims, the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a>, who traverse these circuits from within outward, entering Havona through the pilot world of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> circuit and proceeding outward to the seventh.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_2">26:3.2</a></small></sup>  The ascending pilgrims from the seven superuniverses pass through Havona in the opposite direction, entering by way of the pilot world of the seventh circuit and proceeding inward. There is no time limit set on the progress of the ascending creatures from world to world and from circuit to circuit, just as no fixed span of time is arbitrarily assigned to residence on the morontia worlds. But, whereas adequately developed individuals may be exempted from sojourn on one or more of the local universe training worlds, no pilgrim may avoid passing through all seven of the Havona circuits of progressive spiritualization.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_3">26:3.3</a></small></sup>  That corps of tertiary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> which is chiefly assigned to the service of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> is classified as follows:</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_4">26:3.4</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The Harmony Supervisors.</i> It must be apparent that some sort of co-ordinating influence would be required, even in perfect <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, to maintain system and to insure harmony in all the work of preparing the pilgrims of time for their subsequent <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> achievements. Such is the real mission of the <a href="/en/topic/harmony_supervisors">harmony supervisors</a>‚Äîto keep everything moving along smoothly and expeditiously. Originating on <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> circuit, they serve throughout Havona, and their presence on the circuits means that nothing can possibly go amiss. A great ability to co-ordinate a diversity of activities involving personalities of differing orders‚Äîeven multiple levels‚Äîenables these supernaphim to give assistance wherever and whenever required. They contribute enormously to the mutual understanding of the pilgrims of time and the pilgrims of eternity.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_5">26:3.5</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The Chief Recorders.</i> These <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> are created on the second circuit but operate everywhere in the central universe. They record in triplicate, executing records for the literal files of Havona, for the spiritual files of their order, and for the formal records of Paradise. In addition they automatically transmit the transactions of true-knowledge import to the living libraries of Paradise, the <a href="/en/topic/custodians_of_knowledge">custodians of knowledge</a> of the primary order of <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_6">26:3.6</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/broadcasters_(superior_seraphim)">Broadcasters</a>.</i> The children of the third Circuit Spirit function throughout <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, although their official station is located on planet number seventy in the outermost circle. These master <a href="/en/topic/technicians">technicians</a> are the <a href="/en/topic/broadcast_receivers">broadcast receivers</a> and senders of the central creation and the directors of the space reports of all <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> phenomena on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. They can operate all of the basic circuits of space.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_7">26:3.7</a></small></sup>  4. <i>The Messengers</i> take origin on circuit number four. They range the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a> as bearers of all messages requiring personal transmission. They serve their fellows, the celestial personalities, the Paradise pilgrims, and even the ascendant souls of time.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_8">26:3.8</a></small></sup>  5. <i>The Intelligence Co-ordinators.</i> These tertiary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, the children of the fifth Circuit Spirit, are always the wise and sympathetic promoters of fraternal association between the ascending and the descending pilgrims. They minister to all the inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, and especially to the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a>, by keeping them currently informed regarding the affairs of the universe of universes. By virtue of personal contacts with the <a href="/en/topic/broadcasters_(superior_seraphim)">broadcasters</a> and the reflectors, these ‚Äúliving newspapers‚Äù of Havona are instantly conversant with all information passing over the vast news circuits of the central universe. They secure intelligence by the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_graph_method">Havona graph method</a>, which enables them automatically to assimilate as much information in one hour of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time as would require a thousand years for your most rapid telegraphic technique to record.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_9">26:3.9</a></small></sup>  6. <i>The Transport Personalities.</i> These beings, of origin on circuit number six, usually operate from planet number forty in the outermost circuit. It is they who take away the disappointed candidates who transiently <a href="/en/topic/defeat">fail</a> in the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> adventure. They stand ready to serve all who must come and go in the service of Havona, and who are not space traversers.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p3_10">26:3.10</a></small></sup>  7. <i>The Reserve Corps.</i> The fluctuations in the work with the ascendant beings, the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> pilgrims, and other orders of beings sojourning in <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, make it necessary to maintain these reserves of <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> on the pilot world of the seventh circle, where they take origin. They are created without special design and are competent to take up service in the less exacting phases of any of the duties of their superaphic associates of the tertiary order.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. THE SECONDARY SUPERNAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p4_1">26:4.1</a></small></sup>  The secondary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> are ministers to the seven planetary circuits of the central universe. Part are devoted to the service of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a>, and one half of the entire order is assigned to the training of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> pilgrims of eternity. These <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a>, in their pilgrimage through the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> circuits, are also attended by volunteers from the Mortal Finality Corps, an arrangement that has prevailed since the completion of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> group.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p4_2">26:4.2</a></small></sup>  According to their periodic assignment to the ministry of the ascending pilgrims, secondary supernaphim work in the following seven groups:</p>

<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p9_4">26:9.4</a></small></sup>  Step by step, life by life, world by world, the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant career</a> has been mastered, and the goal of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> has been attained. Survival is complete in <a href="/en/topic/perfection">perfection</a>, and perfection is replete in the supremacy of divinity. Time is lost in eternity; space is swallowed up in worshipful identity and harmony with the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> flash forth the space reports of glory, the good news that in very truth the conscientious creatures of animal nature and material origin have, through evolutionary ascension, become in reality and eternally the perfected sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p10" class="toc-header"><a href="#p10" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 10. THE COUNSELORS AND ADVISERS </h2>
<p id="p10_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_1">26:10.1</a></small></sup>  The superaphic <a href="/en/topic/counselors_and_advisers">counselors and advisers</a> of the second circle are the instructors of the children of time regarding the career of eternity. The attainment of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> entails responsibilities of a new and higher order, and the sojourn on the second circle affords ample opportunity to receive the helpful counsel of these devoted <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>.</p>
<p id="p10_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_2">26:10.2</a></small></sup>  Those who are unsuccessful in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> effort at <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> attainment are advanced from the circle of failure directly to the second circle before they are returned to superuniverse service. Thus the counselors and advisers also serve as the counselors and comforters of these disappointed pilgrims. They have just encountered their greatest <a href="/en/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a>, in no way differing from the long list of such experiences whereon they climbed, as on a ladder, from chaos to glory‚Äîexcept in its magnitude. These are they who have drained the experiential cup to its dregs; and I have observed that they temporarily return to the services of the superuniverses as the highest type of loving ministrators to the children of time and temporal disappointments.</p>
<p id="p10_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_3">26:10.3</a></small></sup>  After a long sojourn on circuit number two the subjects of disappointment are examined by the councils of perfection sitting on the pilot world of this circle and are certified as having passed the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> test; and this, so far as nonspiritual status is concerned, grants them the same standing in the universes of time as if they had actually succeeded in the Deity adventure. The spirit of such candidates was wholly acceptable; their failure was inherent in some phase of the technique of approach or in some part of their experiential background.</p>
<p id="p10_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_4">26:10.4</a></small></sup>  They are then taken by the counselors of the circle before the <a href="/en/topic/chiefs_of_assignment">chiefs of assignment</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and are remanded to the service of time on the worlds of space; and they go with joy and gladness to the tasks of former days and ages. In another day they will return to the circle of their greatest <a href="/en/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a> and attempt anew the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> adventure.</p>
<p id="p10_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_5">26:10.5</a></small></sup>  For the successful pilgrims on the second circuit the stimulus of evolutionary uncertainty is over, but the adventure of the eternal assignment has not yet begun; and while the sojourn on this circle is wholly pleasurable and highly profitable, it lacks some of the anticipative enthusiasm of the former circles. Many are the pilgrims who, at such a time, look back upon the long, long struggle with a joyous <a href="/en/topic/envy">envy</a>, really wishing they might somehow go back to the worlds of time and begin it all over again, just as you <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, in approaching advanced age, sometimes look back over the struggles of youth and early life and truly wish you might live your lives over once again.</p>
<p id="p10_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_6">26:10.6</a></small></sup>  But the traversal of the innermost circle lies just ahead, and soon thereafter <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> transit sleep will terminate, and the new adventure of the eternal career will begin. The <a href="/en/topic/counselors_and_advisers">counselors and advisers</a> on the second circle begin the preparation of their subjects for this great and final <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a>, the inevitable sleep which ever intervenes between the epochal stages of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant career</a>.</p>
<p id="p10_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p10_7">26:10.7</a></small></sup>  When those ascendant pilgrims who have attained the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> complete the second-circle experience, their ever-attendant <a href="/en/topic/Graduate_Guides">Graduate Guides</a> issue the order admitting them to the final circle. These guides personally pilot their subjects to the inner circle and there place them in the custody of the <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complements of rest</a>, the last of those orders of secondary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> assigned to the ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> on the world circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p11" class="toc-header"><a href="#p11" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 11. THE COMPLEMENTS OF REST </h2>
<p id="p11_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_1">26:11.1</a></small></sup>  Much of an ascender‚Äôs time on <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> circuit is devoted to a continuation of the study of the impending problems of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> residence. A vast and diverse host of beings, the majority unrevealed, are permanent and transient residents of this inner ring of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds. And the commingling of these manifold types provides the superaphic <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complements of rest</a> with a rich situational environment which they effectively utilize in furthering the education of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a>, especially with regard to the problems of adjustment to the many groups of beings soon to be encountered on Paradise.</p>
<p id="p11_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_2">26:11.2</a></small></sup>  Among those who dwell on this inner circuit are the <a href="/en/topic/creature-trinitized_sons">creature-trinitized sons</a>. The primary and the secondary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> are the general custodians of the conjoint corps of these sons, including the trinitized offspring of the mortal <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> and similar progeny of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a>. Certain of these sons are <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> embraced and commissioned in the supergovernments, others are variously assigned, but the great majority are being gathered together in the conjoint corps on the perfect worlds of the inner Havona circuit. Here, under the supervision of the supernaphim, they are being prepared for some future work by a special and unnamed corps of high Paradise Citizens who were, prior to the times of <a href="/en/topic/Grandfanda">Grandfanda</a>, first executive assistants to the <a href="/en/topic/Eternals_of_Days">Eternals of Days</a>. There are many reasons for conjecturing that these two unique groups of trinitized beings are going to work together in the remote future, not the least of which is their common destiny in the reserves of the Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Trinitized_Finaliters">Corps of Trinitized Finaliters</a>.</p>
<p id="p11_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_3">26:11.3</a></small></sup>  On this innermost circuit, both the ascending and the descending pilgrims fraternize with each other and with the creature-trinitized sons. Like their parents, these sons derive great benefits from interassociation, and it is the special mission of the supernaphim to facilitate and to insure the confraternity of the trinitized sons of the mortal finaliters and the trinitized sons of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Citizens. The superaphic <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complements of rest</a> are not so much concerned with their training as with promoting their understanding association with diverse groups.</p>
<p id="p11_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_4">26:11.4</a></small></sup>  Mortals have received the Paradise command: ‚ÄúBe you perfect, even as your Paradise Father is perfect<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.‚Äù To these trinitized sons of the conjoint corps the supervising <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> never cease to proclaim: ‚ÄúBe you understanding of your ascendant brethren, even as the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Creator_Sons">Paradise Creator Sons</a> know and love them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p11_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_5">26:11.5</a></small></sup>  The mortal creature must find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. The Creator Son never stops until he finds man‚Äîthe lowest will creature. Beyond doubt, the Creator Sons and their mortal children are preparing for some future and unknown universe service. Both traverse the gamut of the experiential universe and so are educated and trained for their eternal mission. Throughout the universes there is occurring this unique blending of the human and the divine, the commingling of creature and Creator. Unthinking <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> have referred to the manifestation of divine <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a> and <a href="/en/topic/tenderness">tenderness</a>, especially towards the <a href="/en/topic/weak">weak</a> and in behalf of the needy, as indicative of an anthropomorphic God. What a mistake! Rather should such manifestations of mercy and forbearance by human beings be taken as evidence that mortal man is indwelt by the spirit of the living God; that the creature is, after all, divinity motivated.</p>
<p id="p11_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_6">26:11.6</a></small></sup>  Near the end of the first-circle sojourn the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> first meet the <a href="/en/topic/instigators_of_rest">instigators of rest</a> of the primary order of <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>. These are the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> coming out to greet those who stand at the threshold of eternity and to complete their preparation for the transition slumber of the last resurrection. You are not really a child of Paradise until you have traversed the inner circle and have experienced the resurrection of eternity from the terminal sleep of time. The perfected pilgrims begin this <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a>, go to sleep, on <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> circle of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, but they awaken on the shores of Paradise. Of all who ascend to the eternal Isle, only those who thus arrive are the children of eternity; the others go as visitors, as guests without residential status.</p>
<p id="p11_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_7">26:11.7</a></small></sup>  And now, at the culmination of the Havona career, as you <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> go to sleep on the pilot world of the inner circuit, you go not alone to your rest as you did on the worlds of your origin when you closed your eyes in the natural sleep of mortal death, nor as you did when you entered the long transit trance preparatory for the journey to Havona. Now, as you prepare for the attainment rest, there moves over by your side your long-time associate of the first circle, the majestic <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complement of rest</a>, who prepares to enter the rest as one with you, as the pledge of Havona that your transition is complete, and that you await only the final touches of perfection.</p>
<p id="p11_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p11_8">26:11.8</a></small></sup>  Your first transition was indeed death, the second an ideal sleep, and now the third metamorphosis is the true <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a>, the relaxation of the ages.</p>
