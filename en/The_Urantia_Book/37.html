<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p0_1">37:0.1</a></small></sup>  AT THE head of all personality in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> stands the Creator and <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Son, <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>, the universe father and sovereign. Co-ordinate in divinity and complemental in creative attributes is the local universe Mother Spirit, the Divine Minister of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>. And these creators are in a very literal sense the Father-Son and the Spirit-Mother of all the native creatures of Nebadon.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p0_2">37:0.2</a></small></sup>  Preceding papers have dealt with the created orders of sonship; succeeding narratives will portray the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> and the ascending orders of sonship. This paper is chiefly concerned with an intervening group, the <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Aids">Universe Aids</a>, but it will also give brief consideration to certain of the higher spirits stationed in Nebadon and to certain of the orders of permanent citizenship in the local universe.</p>

<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p1_9">37:1.9</a></small></sup>  Of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> order of <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Aids">Universe Aids</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Stars</a>, there is just one in each local universe, and he is the first-born of all creatures native to a local universe. The Bright and Morning Star of our universe is known as <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>. He is the chief executive of all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, functioning as the personal representative of the Sovereign Son and as spokesman for his creative consort.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p1_10">37:1.10</a></small></sup>  During the earlier times of Nebadon, Gabriel worked quite alone with <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> and the Creative Spirit. As the universe grew and administrative problems multiplied, he was provided with a personal staff of unrevealed assistants, and eventually this group was augmented by the creation of the Nebadon corps of <a href="/en/topic/Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE BRILLIANT EVENING STARS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_1">37:2.1</a></small></sup>  These <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">brilliant creatures</a> were planned by the Melchizedeks and were then brought into being by the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the Creative Spirit. They serve in many capacities but chiefly as liaison officers of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, the local universe chief executive. One or more of these beings function as his representatives at the capital of every constellation and system in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_2">37:2.2</a></small></sup>  As chief executive of Nebadon, Gabriel is ex officio chairman of, or <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">observer</a> at, most of the <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> <a href="/en/topic/conclaves">conclaves</a>, and as many as one thousand of these are often in session simultaneously. The <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars_(chief)">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> represent Gabriel on these occasions; he cannot be in two places at the same time, and these <a href="/en/topic/superangels">superangels</a> compensate for this limitation. They perform an analogous service for the corps of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_3">37:2.3</a></small></sup>  Though personally occupied with administrative duties, <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> maintains contact with all other phases of universe life and affairs through the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a>. They always accompany him on his planetary tours and frequently go on special missions to the individual planets as his personal representatives. On such assignments they have sometimes been known as “the angel of the Lord<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.” They frequently go to <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> to represent the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a> before the courts and assemblies of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>, but they seldom journey beyond the confines of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_4">37:2.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars_(chief)">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> are a unique twofold order, embracing some of created dignity and others of attained service. The <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> corps of these <a href="/en/topic/superangels">superangels</a> now numbers 13,641. There are 4,832 of created dignity, while 8,809 are ascendant spirits who have attained this goal of exalted service. Many of these ascendant <a href="/en/topic/Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a> started their universe careers as <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>; others have ascended from unrevealed levels of creature life. As an attainment goal this high corps is never closed to ascension candidates so long as a universe is not settled in light and life.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_5">37:2.5</a></small></sup>  Both types of <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> are easily visible to morontia personalities and certain types of supermortal material beings. The created beings of this interesting and versatile order possess a spirit force which can be manifested independently of their personal presence.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_6">37:2.6</a></small></sup>  The head of these <a href="/en/topic/superangels">superangels</a> is <a href="/en/topic/Gavalia">Gavalia</a>, the first-born of this order in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. Since the return of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> from his triumphant bestowal on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, Gavalia has been assigned to the ascendant mortal ministry, and for the last nineteen hundred Urantia years his associate, <a href="/en/topic/Galantia">Galantia</a>, has maintained headquarters on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, where he spends about half of his time. Galantia is <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the ascendant superangels to attain this high estate.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_7">37:2.7</a></small></sup>  No grouping or company organization of the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> exists other than their customary association in pairs on many assignments. They are not extensively assigned on missions pertaining to the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant career</a> of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, but when thus commissioned, they never function alone. They always work in pairs—one a created being, the other an ascendant Evening Star.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_8">37:2.8</a></small></sup>  One of the high duties of the Evening Stars is to accompany the Avonal bestowal Sons on their planetary missions, even as <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> accompanied <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> on his <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> bestowal. The two attending <a href="/en/topic/superangels">superangels</a> are the ranking personalities of such missions, serving as cocommanders of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a> and all others assigned to these undertakings. It is the senior of these superangel commanders who, at the significant time and age, bids the Avonal bestowal Son, “Be about your brother’s business.”</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_9">37:2.9</a></small></sup>  Similar pairs of these superangels are assigned to the planetary corps of <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a> that functions to establish the postbestowal or dawning spiritual age of an inhabited world. On such assignments the <a href="/en/topic/Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a> serve as liaisons between the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realm and the invisible corps of <a href="/en/topic/Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_10">37:2.10</a></small></sup>  <i>The Worlds of the Evening Stars.</i> The sixth group of seven <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> worlds and their forty-two tributary satellites are assigned to the administration of the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars_(chief)">Brilliant Evening Stars</a>. The seven primary worlds are presided over by the created orders of these <a href="/en/topic/superangels">superangels</a>, while the tributary satellites are administered by ascendant Evening Stars.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_11">37:2.11</a></small></sup>  The satellites of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> three worlds are devoted to the schools of the <a href="/en/topic/Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a> dedicated to the spirit personalities of the local universe. The next three groups are occupied by similar joint schools devoted to the training of <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>. The seventh-world satellites are reserved for the triune deliberations of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a>. During recent times these superangels have been closely identified with the local universe work of the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>, and they have long been associated with the Teacher Sons. There exists a liaison of tremendous power and import between the Evening Stars and the <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a> attached to the finaliter working groups. The seventh primary world itself is reserved for those unrevealed matters which pertain to the future relationship that will obtain between the Teacher Sons, the finaliters, and the Evening Stars consequent upon the completed emergence of the superuniverse manifestation of the personality of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Supreme">God the Supreme</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE ARCHANGELS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_1">37:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/archangels">Archangels</a> are the offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the Universe Mother Spirit. They are the highest type of high spirit being produced in large numbers in a local universe, and at the time of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> registry there were almost eight hundred thousand in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_2">37:3.2</a></small></sup>  Archangels are one of the few groups of local universe personalities who are not normally under the jurisdiction of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>. They are not in any manner concerned with the routine administration of the universe, being dedicated to the work of creature survival and to the furtherance of the ascending career of the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of time and space. While not ordinarily subject to the direction of the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a>, the archangels do sometimes function by his authority. They also collaborate with others of the <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Aids">Universe Aids</a>, such as the <a href="/en/topic/Evening_Stars">Evening Stars</a>, as is illustrated by certain transactions depicted in the narrative of life transplantation on your world.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_3">37:3.3</a></small></sup>  The archangel corps of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is directed by the first-born of this order, and in more recent times a divisional headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a> has been maintained on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. It is this unusual fact that soon arrests the attention of extra-Nebadon <a href="/en/topic/student_visitors">student visitors</a>. Among their early observations of intrauniverse transactions is the discovery that many ascendant activities of the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars_(chief)">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> are directed from the capital of a local system, <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. On further examination they discover that certain archangel activities are directed from a small and apparently insignificant inhabited world called Urantia. And then ensues the revelation of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>’s bestowal on Urantia and their immediately quickened interest in you and your lowly sphere.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_4">37:3.4</a></small></sup>  Do you grasp the significance of the fact that your lowly and confused planet has become a divisional headquarters for the universe administration and direction of certain archangel activities having to do with the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascension scheme? This undoubtedly presages the future concentration of other ascendant activities on the bestowal world of Michael and lends a tremendous and solemn import to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s personal promise, “I will come again<sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_5">37:3.5</a></small></sup>  In general, the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a> are assigned to the service and ministry of the Avonal order of sonship, but not until they have passed through extensive preliminary training in all phases of the work of the various <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a>. A <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corps of one hundred</a> accompanies every Paradise bestowal Son to an inhabited world, being temporarily assigned to him for the duration of such a bestowal. If the Magisterial Son should become temporary ruler of the planet, these archangels would act as the directing heads of all celestial life on that sphere.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_6">37:3.6</a></small></sup>  Two senior archangels are always assigned as the personal aids of a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Avonal on all planetary missions, whether involving judicial actions, magisterial missions, or bestowal incarnations. When this Paradise Son has finished the judgment of a realm and the dead are called to record (the so-called <a href="/en/topic/resurrection">resurrection</a>), it is literally true that the seraphic guardians of the slumbering personalities respond to “the voice of the archangel<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>.” The roll call of a dispensation termination is promulgated by an attendant archangel. This is the archangel of the resurrection, sometimes referred to as the “archangel of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a><sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_7">37:3.7</a></small></sup>  <i>The Worlds of the Archangels.</i> The seventh group of the encircling <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> worlds, with their associated satellites, is assigned to the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>. Sphere number one and all of its six tributary satellites are occupied by the personality record keepers. This enormous corps of <a href="/en/topic/recorders">recorders</a> busy themselves with keeping straight the record of each mortal of time from the moment of birth up through the universe career until such an individual either leaves Salvington for the superuniverse regime or is “blotted out of recorded existence” by the mandate of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a><sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_8">37:3.8</a></small></sup>  It is on these worlds that personality <a href="/en/topic/records">records</a> and identification sureties are classified, filed, and preserved during that time which intervenes between mortal death and the hour of repersonalization, the resurrection from death.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. MOST HIGH ASSISTANTS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p4_1">37:4.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_Assistants">Most High Assistants</a> are a group of volunteering beings, of origin outside the local universe, who are temporarily assigned as central and superuniverse representatives to, or observers of, the local creations. Their number varies constantly but is always far up in the millions.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p4_2">37:4.2</a></small></sup>  From time to time we thus benefit from the ministry and assistance of such Paradise-origin beings as <a href="/en/topic/Perfectors_of_Wisdom">Perfectors of Wisdom</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Divine_Counselors">Divine Counselors</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Censors">Universal Censors</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Inspired_Trinity_Spirits">Inspired Trinity Spirits</a>, Trinitized Sons, <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/tertiaphim">tertiaphim</a>, and other gracious ministers, who sojourn with us for the purpose of helping our native personalities in the effort to bring all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> into fuller harmony with the ideas of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a> and the ideals of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p4_3">37:4.3</a></small></sup>  Any of these beings may be voluntarily serving in Nebadon and hence be technically outside our jurisdiction, but when functioning by assignment, such personalities of the super- and central universes are not wholly exempt from the regulations of the local universe of their sojourn, though they continue to function as representatives of the higher universes and to work in accordance with the instructions which constitute their mission in our realm. Their general headquarters is situated in the <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> sector of the Union of Days, and they operate in Nebadon subject to the oversupervision of this ambassador of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>. When serving in unattached groups, these personalities from the higher realms are usually self-directing, but when serving on request, they often voluntarily place themselves wholly under the jurisdiction of the supervising directors of the realms of assigned function.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p4_4">37:4.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_Assistants">Most High Assistants</a> serve in local universe and in constellation capacities but are not directly attached to the system or planetary governments. They may, however, function anywhere in the local universe and may be assigned to any phase of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> activity—administrative, executive, educational, and others.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p4_5">37:4.5</a></small></sup>  Most of this corps is enlisted in assisting the Nebadon <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> personalities—the Union of Days, the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Faithfuls_of_Days">Faithfuls of Days</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a>. Now and then in the transaction of the affairs of a local creation it becomes wise to withhold certain details, temporarily, from the knowledge of practically all of the native personalities of that local universe. Certain advanced plans and complex rulings are also better grasped and more fully understood by the more mature and farseeing corps of Most High Assistants, and it is in such situations, and many others, that they are so highly serviceable to the universe rulers and administrators.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. HIGH COMMISSIONERS </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p5_1">37:5.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/High_Commissioners">High Commissioners</a> are Spirit-fused ascendant <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>; they are not Adjuster fused. You quite well understand about the universe-ascension career of a mortal candidate for <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster_fusion">Adjuster fusion</a>, that being the high destiny in prospect for all <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> mortals since the bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>. But this is not the exclusive destiny of all mortals in the prebestowal ages of worlds like yours, and there is another type of world whose inhabitants are never permanently indwelt by <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>. Such mortals are never permanently joined in union with a Mystery Monitor of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> bestowal; nevertheless, the Adjusters do transiently indwell them, serving as guides and patterns for the duration of the life in the flesh. During this temporary sojourn they foster the evolution of an immortal <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> just as in those beings with whom they hope to fuse, but when the mortal race is run, they take eternal leave of the creatures of temporary association.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p5_2">37:5.2</a></small></sup>  Surviving souls of this order attain immortality by eternal fusion with an individualized fragment of the spirit of the local universe Mother Spirit. They are not a numerous group, at least not in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. On the mansion worlds you will meet and fraternize with these <a href="/en/topic/Spirit-fused_mortals">Spirit-fused mortals</a> as they ascend the Paradise path with you as far as <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, where they stop. Some of them may subsequently ascend to higher universe levels, but the majority will forever remain in the service of the local universe; as a class they are not destined to attain Paradise.</p>

These children of the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit constitute the permanent population of the constellation headquarters worlds. They are nonreproducing beings existing on a plane of life about halfway between the semimaterial status of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> domiciled on the system headquarters and the more definitely spiritual plane of the Spirit-fused mortals and the susatia of Salvington; but the univitatia are not morontia beings. They accomplish for <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> during the traversal of the constellation spheres what the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> contribute to the pilgrim spirits passing through the central creation.</p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p9_9">37:9.9</a></small></sup>  <i>The Material <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a>.</i> When a creative liaison between the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the universe representative of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, the Universe Mother Spirit, has completed its cycle, when no more offspring of the combined nature are forthcoming, then does the Creator Son personalize in dual form his last concept of being, thus finally confirming his own and original dual origin.

On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> the midway ministers are in reality the actual custodians of the planet; they are, practically speaking, the citizens of Urantia. Mortals are indeed the physical and material inhabitants of an evolutionary world, but you are all so short-lived; you tarry on your nativity planet such a short time. You are born, live, die, and pass on to other worlds of evolutionary progression. Even the superhuman beings who serve on the planets as celestial ministers are of transient assignment; few of them are long attached to a given sphere. The midway creatures, however, provide continuity of planetary administration in the face of ever-changing celestial ministries and constantly shifting mortal inhabitants. Throughout all of this never-ceasing changing and shifting, the midway creatures remain on the planet uninterruptedly carrying on their work.</p>

The administrative worlds of the minor and <a href="/en/topic/major_sectors">major sectors</a> of the superuniverses do not have permanent citizens.

<p id="p10_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p10_4">37:10.4</a></small></sup>  The various <i><a href="/en/topic/courtesy_colonies">courtesy colonies</a></i> are domiciled on Salvington and elsewhere. We especially profit from the ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_artisans">celestial artisans</a> on the constellations and benefit from the activities of the <a href="/en/topic/reversion_directors">reversion directors</a>, who operate chiefly on the capitals of the local systems.</p>
<p id="p10_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p10_5">37:10.5</a></small></sup>  Always there is attached to the universe <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> a corps of <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>, including the glorified midway creatures. These ascenders, after attaining <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, are used in an almost endless variety of activities in the conduct of universe affairs. From each level of achievement these advancing <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> reach back and down to extend a helping hand to their fellows who follow them in the upward climb. Such mortals of temporary sojourn on Salvington are assigned on requisition to practically all corps of celestial personalities as helpers, students, observers, and teachers.</p>
<p id="p10_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p10_6">37:10.6</a></small></sup>  There are still other types of intelligent life concerned with the administration of a local <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>, but the plan of this narrative does not provide for the further revelation of these orders of creation. Enough of the life and administration of this universe is being herewith portrayed to afford the mortal mind a grasp of the reality and grandeur of the survival existence. Further experience in your advancing careers will increasingly reveal these interesting and charming beings. This narrative cannot be more than a brief outline of the nature and work of the manifold personalities who throng the universes of space administering these creations as enormous training schools, schools wherein the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> advance from life to life and from world to world until they are lovingly dispatched from the borders of the universe of their origin to the higher educational regime of the superuniverse and thence on to the spirit-training worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and eventually to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and the high destiny of the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a>—the eternal assignment on missions not yet revealed to the universes of time and space.</p>
