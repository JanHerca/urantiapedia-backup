Man‚Äôs first supermind endowment is that of personality encircuitment in the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> of the Universe Creative Spirit; and long before either the bestowals of the divine Sons or the universal bestowal of the Adjusters, this influence functions to enlarge man‚Äôs viewpoint of ethics, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, and spirituality. Subsequent to the bestowals of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Paradise Sons</a> the liberated <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> makes mighty contributions to the enlargement of the human capacity to perceive religious truths. As evolution advances on an inhabited world, the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> increasingly participate in the development of the higher types of human religious insight. The Thought Adjuster is the cosmic window through which the finite creature may faith-glimpse the certainties and divinities of limitless <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p0_2">103:0.2</a></small></sup>  The religious tendencies of the human races are innate; they are universally manifested and have an apparently natural origin; primitive religions are always evolutionary in their genesis. As natural religious experience continues to progress, periodic revelations of truth punctuate the otherwise slow-moving course of planetary evolution.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p0_3">103:0.3</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, today, there are four kinds of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>:</p>

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_1">103:1.1</a></small></sup>  The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> is unique‚Äîno two <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> being alike‚Äîit inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience <a href="/en/topic/spiritual_unity">spiritual unity</a>, but they can never attain philosophic <a href="/en/topic/uniformity">uniformity</a>. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious <a href="/en/topic/philosophy">philosophy</a> of all other human beings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_2">103:1.2</a></small></sup>  When one mortal is in full agreement with the religious philosophy of a fellow mortal, that phenomenon indicates that these two beings have had a similar <i>religious experience</i> touching the matters concerned in their similarity of philosophic religious interpretation.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_3">103:1.3</a></small></sup>  While your <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is a matter of personal experience, it is most important that you should be exposed to the knowledge of a vast number of other religious experiences (the diverse interpretations of other and diverse <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>) to the end that you may prevent your religious life from becoming <a href="/en/topic/egocentricity">egocentric</a>‚Äîcircumscribed, selfish, and unsocial.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_4">103:1.4</a></small></sup>  Rationalism is wrong when it assumes that religion is at first a primitive belief in something which is then followed by the pursuit of <a href="/en/topic/values">values</a>. Religion is primarily a pursuit of values, and then there formulates a system of interpretative beliefs. It is much easier for men to agree on religious values‚Äîgoals‚Äîthan on beliefs‚Äîinterpretations. And this explains how religion can agree on values and goals while exhibiting the confusing phenomenon of maintaining a belief in hundreds of conflicting beliefs‚Äîcreeds. This also explains why a given person can maintain his religious experience in the face of giving up or changing many of his religious beliefs. Religion persists in spite of revolutionary changes in religious beliefs. Theology does not produce religion; it is religion that produces theologic philosophy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_5">103:1.5</a></small></sup>  That religionists have believed so much that was false does not invalidate <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> because religion is founded on the recognition of values and is validated by the faith of personal religious experience. Religion, then, is based on experience and religious thought; <a href="/en/topic/theology">theology</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/philosophy">philosophy</a> of religion, is an honest attempt to interpret that experience. Such interpretative beliefs may be right or wrong, or a mixture of truth and error.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_6">103:1.6</a></small></sup>  The realization of the recognition of spiritual values is an experience which is superideational. There is no word in any human <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> which can be employed to designate this ‚Äúsense,‚Äù ‚Äúfeeling,‚Äù ‚Äúintuition,‚Äù or ‚Äúexperience‚Äù which we have elected to call God-consciousness. The spirit of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> that dwells in man is not personal‚Äîthe Adjuster is prepersonal‚Äîbut this Monitor presents a value, exudes a flavor of divinity, which is personal in the highest and infinite sense. If God were not at least personal, he could not be conscious, and if not conscious, then would he be infrahuman<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_1">103:2.1</a></small></sup>  Religion is functional in the human mind and has been realized in experience prior to its appearance in human consciousness. A child has been in existence about nine months before it experiences <i>birth.</i> But the ‚Äúbirth‚Äù of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is not sudden; it is rather a gradual emergence. Nevertheless, sooner or later there is a ‚Äúbirth day<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.‚Äù You do not enter the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> unless you have been ‚Äúborn again‚Äù‚Äîborn of the Spirit. Many spiritual births are accompanied by much anguish of spirit and marked psychological perturbations, as many physical births are characterized by a ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/childbirth">stormy labor</a>‚Äù and other abnormalities of ‚Äúdelivery.‚Äù Other spiritual births are a natural and normal growth of the recognition of supreme values with an enhancement of spiritual experience, albeit no religious development occurs without conscious effort and positive and individual determinations. Religion is never a passive experience, a negative attitude. What is termed the ‚Äúbirth of religion‚Äù is not directly associated with so-called conversion experiences which usually characterize religious episodes occurring later in life as a result of mental conflict, emotional repression, and temperamental upheavals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_2">103:2.2</a></small></sup>  But those persons who were so reared by their parents that they grew up in the consciousness of being children of a loving heavenly Father, should not look askance at their fellow <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who could only attain such consciousness of fellowship with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> through a psychological crisis, an emotional upheaval.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_3">103:2.3</a></small></sup>  The evolutionary soil in the mind of man in which the seed of revealed <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> germinates is the moral nature that so early gives origin to a social consciousness. The first promptings of a child‚Äôs moral nature have not to do with sex, guilt, or personal pride, but rather with impulses of justice, fairness, and urges to kindness‚Äîhelpful ministry to one‚Äôs fellows. And when such early moral awakenings are nurtured, there occurs a gradual development of the religious life which is comparatively free from conflicts, upheavals, and crises.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_4">103:2.4</a></small></sup>  Every human being very early experiences something of a conflict between his self-seeking and his <a href="/en/topic/altruism">altruistic</a> impulses, and many times <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> experience of God-consciousness may be attained as the result of seeking for superhuman help in the task of resolving such moral conflicts.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_5">103:2.5</a></small></sup>  The psychology of a child is naturally positive, not negative. So many <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> are negative because they were so trained. When it is said that the child is positive, reference is made to his moral impulses, those powers of mind whose emergence signals the arrival of the Thought Adjuster.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_6">103:2.6</a></small></sup>  In the absence of wrong teaching, the mind of the normal child moves positively, in the emergence of religious consciousness, toward moral righteousness and social ministry, rather than negatively, away from sin and guilt. There may or may not be conflict in the development of religious experience, but there are always present the inevitable decisions, effort, and function of the human will.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_7">103:2.7</a></small></sup>  Moral choosing is usually accompanied by more or less moral conflict. And this very first conflict in the <a href="/en/topic/children">child</a> mind is between the urges of egoism and the impulses of <a href="/en/topic/altruism">altruism</a>. The Thought Adjuster does not disregard the personality values of the egoistic motive but does operate to place a slight preference upon the altruistic impulse as leading to the goal of human happiness and to the joys of the kingdom of heaven.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_8">103:2.8</a></small></sup>  When a moral being chooses to be unselfish when confronted by the urge to be selfish, that is primitive religious experience. No animal can make such a choice; such a decision is both human and religious. It embraces the fact of God-consciousness and exhibits the impulse of social service, the basis of the <a href="/en/topic/brotherhood_of_man">brotherhood of man</a>. When mind chooses a right moral judgment by an act of the free will, such a decision constitutes a religious experience.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_9">103:2.9</a></small></sup>  But before a child has developed sufficiently to acquire moral capacity and therefore to be able to choose <a href="/en/topic/altruism">altruistic</a> service, he has already developed a strong and well-unified egoistic nature. And it is this factual situation that gives rise to the theory of the struggle between the ‚Äúhigher‚Äù and the ‚Äúlower‚Äù natures, between the ‚Äúold man of sin‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew nature‚Äù of grace<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.

<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_10">103:2.10</a></small></sup>  Man tends to identify the urge to be self-serving with his ego‚Äîhimself. In contrast he is inclined to identify the will to be altruistic with some influence outside himself‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. And indeed is such a judgment right, for all such nonself desires do actually have their origin in the leadings of the indwelling Thought Adjuster, and this Adjuster is a fragment of God. The impulse of the spirit Monitor is realized in human consciousness as the urge to be altruistic, fellow-creature minded. At least this is the early and fundamental experience of the child mind. When the growing child fails of personality unification, the altruistic drive may become so overdeveloped as to work serious injury to the welfare of the <a href="/en/topic/self">self</a>. A misguided <a href="/en/topic/conscience">conscience</a> can become responsible for much conflict, worry, sorrow, and no end of human unhappiness.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. RELIGION AND THE HUMAN RACE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_1">103:3.1</a></small></sup>  While the belief in spirits, dreams, and diverse other superstitions all played a part in the evolutionary origin of primitive religions, you should not overlook the influence of the <a href="/en/topic/clans">clan</a> or tribal spirit of solidarity. In the group relationship there was presented the exact social situation which provided the challenge to the egoistic-altruistic conflict in the moral nature of the early human mind. In spite of their belief in spirits, <a href="/en/topic/aborigines_(Australian)">primitive Australians</a> still focus their <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> upon the clan. In time, such religious concepts tend to personalize, first, as animals, and later, as a superman or as a <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Even such inferior races as the African <a href="/en/topic/Bushmen">Bushmen</a>, who are not even totemic in their beliefs, do have a recognition of the difference between the self-interest and the group-interest, a primitive distinction between the values of the secular and the sacred. But the social group is not the source of religious experience. Regardless of the influence of all these primitive contributions to man‚Äôs early religion, the fact remains that the true religious impulse has its origin in genuine spirit presences activating the will to be unselfish.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_2">103:3.2</a></small></sup>  Later religion is foreshadowed in the primitive belief in natural wonders and mysteries, the impersonal mana. But sooner or later the evolving religion requires that the individual should make some personal sacrifice for the good of his social group, should do something to make other people happier and better. Ultimately, religion is destined to become the service of God and of man.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_3">103:3.3</a></small></sup>  Religion is designed to change man‚Äôs environment, but much of the <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> found among <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> today has become helpless to do this. Environment has all too often mastered religion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_4">103:3.4</a></small></sup>  Remember that in the religion of all ages the experience which is paramount is the feeling regarding moral values and social meanings, not the thinking regarding theologic dogmas or philosophic theories. Religion evolves favorably as the element of magic is replaced by the concept of morals.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_5">103:3.5</a></small></sup>  Man evolved through the superstitions of mana, magic, nature worship, spirit fear, and animal worship to the various ceremonials whereby the religious attitude of the individual became the group reactions of the clan. And then these ceremonies became focalized and crystallized into tribal beliefs, and eventually these fears and faiths became personalized into gods. But in all of this religious evolution the moral element was never wholly absent. The impulse of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> within man was always potent. And these powerful influences‚Äîone human and the other divine‚Äîinsured the survival of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> throughout the vicissitudes of the ages and that notwithstanding it was so often threatened with extinction by a thousand subversive tendencies and hostile antagonisms.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. SPIRITUAL COMMUNION </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_1">103:4.1</a></small></sup>  The characteristic difference between a social occasion and a religious gathering is that in contrast with the secular the religious is pervaded by the atmosphere of <i>communion.</i> In this way human association generates a feeling of fellowship with the divine, and this is the beginning of group <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a>. Partaking of a common meal was the earliest type of social communion, and so did early religions provide that some portion of the ceremonial sacrifice should be eaten by the worshipers. Even in <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Lord‚Äôs_Supper">Lord‚Äôs Supper</a> retains this mode of communion. The atmosphere of the communion provides a refreshing and comforting period of truce in the conflict of the self-seeking ego with the altruistic urge of the indwelling spirit Monitor. And this is the prelude to true worship‚Äîthe practice of the presence of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> which eventuates in the emergence of the brotherhood of man.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a21"><a href="#fn_a21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_2">103:4.2</a></small></sup>  When primitive man felt that his communion with God had been interrupted, he resorted to sacrifice of some kind in an effort to make atonement, to restore friendly relationship. The hunger and thirst for <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a> leads to the discovery of truth, and truth augments <a href="/en/topic/ideals">ideals</a>, and this creates new problems for the individual religionists, for our ideals tend to grow by geometrical progression, while our ability to live up to them is enhanced only by arithmetical progression.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a22"><a href="#fn_a22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_3">103:4.3</a></small></sup>  The sense of <a href="/en/topic/guilt">guilt</a> (not the consciousness of sin) comes either from interrupted <a href="/en/topic/spiritual_communion">spiritual communion</a> or from the lowering of one‚Äôs moral ideals. Deliverance from such a predicament can only come through the realization that one‚Äôs highest moral ideals are not necessarily synonymous with the <a href="/en/topic/will_of_God">will of God</a>. Man cannot hope to live up to his highest ideals, but he can be true to his purpose of finding <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and becoming more and more like him.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_4">103:4.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> swept away all of the <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonials</a> of sacrifice and atonement. He destroyed the basis of all this fictitious guilt and sense of <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a> in the universe by declaring that man is a child of God; the creature-Creator relationship was placed on a child-parent basis. God becomes a loving Father to his mortal sons and daughters. All ceremonials not a legitimate part of such an intimate family relationship are forever abrogated.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a23"><a href="#fn_a23">[23]</a></sup></p>

The relationship is one of parent-child association and is actuated by divine love.</p>

Reason grows out of material awareness, faith out of spiritual awareness, but through the mediation of a philosophy strengthened by revelation, logic may confirm both the inward and the outward view, thereby effecting the stabilization of both science and religion. Thus, through common contact with the logic of philosophy, may both science and religion become increasingly tolerant of each other, less and less skeptical.</p>

By the technique of such an incarnation of living truth the philosophic hypothesis of the probability of God becomes a religious reality.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_2">103:8.2</a></small></sup>  The confusion about the experience of the certainty of God arises out of the dissimilar interpretations and relations of that experience by separate individuals and by different races of men. The experiencing of God may be wholly valid, but the discourse <i>about</i> God, being intellectual and philosophical, is divergent and oftentimes confusingly fallacious.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_3">103:8.3</a></small></sup>  A good and noble man may be consummately in <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> with his wife but utterly unable to pass a satisfactory written <a href="/en/topic/examinations">examination</a> on the psychology of marital love.

<h2 id="p9" class="toc-header"><a href="#p9" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 9. THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_1">103:9.1</a></small></sup>  Theology deals with the intellectual content of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, metaphysics (revelation) with the philosophic aspects. Religious experience <i>is</i> the spiritual content of religion. Notwithstanding the mythologic vagaries and the psychologic illusions of the intellectual content of religion, the metaphysical assumptions of error and the techniques of self-deception, the political distortions and the socioeconomic perversions of the philosophic content of religion, the spiritual experience of personal religion remains genuine and valid.</p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_2">103:9.2</a></small></sup>  Religion has to do with feeling, acting, and living, not merely with thinking. Thinking is more closely related to the material life and should be in the main, but not altogether, dominated by reason and the facts of science and, in its nonmaterial reaches toward the spirit realms, by truth. No matter how illusory and erroneous one‚Äôs <a href="/en/topic/theology">theology</a>, one‚Äôs religion may be wholly genuine and everlastingly true.</p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_3">103:9.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in its original form is one of the best religions without a <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> which has arisen throughout all the evolutionary history of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, although, as this faith developed, it did not remain godless. Religion without faith is a contradiction; without God, a philosophic inconsistency and an intellectual absurdity.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_4">103:9.4</a></small></sup>  The magical and mythological parentage of natural <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> does not invalidate the reality and truth of the later revelational religions and the consummate saving gospel of the religion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Jesus‚Äô life and teachings finally divested religion of the superstitions of <a href="/en/topic/magic">magic</a>, the illusions of mythology, and the bondage of traditional dogmatism. But this early magic and mythology very effectively prepared the way for later and superior religion by assuming the existence and reality of supermaterial values and beings.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_5">103:9.5</a></small></sup>  Although religious experience is a purely spiritual subjective phenomenon, such an experience embraces a positive and living faith attitude toward the highest realms of universe objective reality. The ideal of religious <a href="/en/topic/philosophy">philosophy</a> is such a faith-trust as would lead man unqualifiedly to depend upon the absolute love of the infinite Father of the universe of universes. Such a genuine religious experience far transcends the philosophic objectification of idealistic desire; it actually takes <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> for granted and concerns itself only with learning and doing the will of the Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. The earmarks of such a religion are: faith in a supreme <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, hope of eternal survival, and love, especially of one‚Äôs fellows.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a60"><a href="#fn_a60">[60]</a></sup></p>

The mission of theology is merely to facilitate the self-consciousness of personal spiritual experience. Theology constitutes the religious effort to define, clarify, expound, and justify the experiential claims of religion, which, in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> analysis, can be validated only by living <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>.
