<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_1">190:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE resurrected <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> now prepares to spend a short period on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> for the purpose of experiencing the ascending morontia career of a mortal of the realms. Although this time of the morontia life is to be spent on the world of his mortal incarnation, it will, however, be in all respects the counterpart of the experience of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who pass through the progressive morontia life of the seven mansion worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_2">190:0.2</a></small></sup>  All this power which is inherent in Jesus—the endowment of life—and which enabled him to rise from the dead, is the very gift of <a href="/en/topic/eternal_life">eternal life</a> which he bestows upon kingdom <a href="/en/topic/believers">believers</a>, and which even now makes certain their resurrection from the bonds of natural death<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_3">190:0.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realms will arise in the morning of the resurrection with the same type of transition or morontia body that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had when he arose from the tomb on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning. These bodies do not have circulating blood, and such beings do not partake of ordinary material food; nevertheless, these morontia forms are <i>real.</i> When the various believers saw Jesus after his resurrection, they really saw him; they were not the self-deceived victims of visions or hallucinations.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_4">190:0.4</a></small></sup>  Abiding faith in the resurrection of Jesus was the cardinal feature of the faith of all branches of the early gospel teaching<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>. In <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> all the gospel teachers united in this implicit faith in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s resurrection.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_5">190:0.5</a></small></sup>  In viewing the prominent part which <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> took in proclaiming the Master’s resurrection, it should be recorded that <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> was the chief spokesman for the <a href="/en/topic/women’s_corps">women’s corps</a>, as was <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> for the apostles. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> was not chief of the <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> workers, but she was their chief teacher and public spokesman. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)">Mary</a> had become a woman of great circumspection, so that her boldness in speaking to a man whom she considered to be the caretaker of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> only indicates how horrified she was to find the tomb empty. It was the depth and agony of her love, the fullness of her devotion, that caused her to forget, for a moment, the conventional restraints of a Jewish woman’s approach to a strange man.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. HERALDS OF THE RESURRECTION </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_1">190:1.1</a></small></sup>  The apostles did not want <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to leave them; therefore had they slighted all his statements about dying, along with his promises to rise again. They were not expecting the resurrection as it came, and they refused to believe until they were confronted with the compulsion of unimpeachable evidence and the absolute proof of their own experiences.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_2">190:1.2</a></small></sup>  When the apostles refused to believe the report of the five women who represented that they had seen Jesus and talked with him, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> returned to the tomb, and the others went back to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s house, where they related their experiences to his daughter and the other women. And the women believed their report. Shortly after six o’clock the daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a> and the four women who had seen Jesus went over to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>, where they related all these happenings to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>, Nicodemus, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a>, and the other men there assembled. Nicodemus and the others doubted their <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a>, doubted that Jesus had risen from the dead; they conjectured that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had removed the body. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> were disposed to believe the report, so much so that they hurried out to inspect the tomb, and they found everything just as the women had described. And they were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> to so view the sepulchre, for the high priest sent the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a> to the tomb at half past seven o’clock to remove the grave cloths. The captain wrapped them all up in the linen sheet and threw them over a near-by cliff.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_3">190:1.3</a></small></sup>  From the tomb David and Joseph went immediately to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah Mark</a>, where they held a conference with the ten apostles in the upper chamber. Only <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> was disposed to believe, even faintly, that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had risen from the dead. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> had believed at first but, when he failed to find the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, fell into grave doubting. They were all disposed to believe that the Jews had removed the body. David would not argue with them, but when he left, he said: “You are the apostles, and you ought to understand these things. I will not contend with you; nevertheless, I now go back to the home of Nicodemus, where I have appointed with the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> to assemble this morning, and when they have gathered together, I will send them forth on their last mission, as heralds of the Master’s resurrection. I heard the Master say that, after he should die, he would rise on the <a href="/en/topic/third_day">third day</a>, and I believe him.” And thus speaking to the dejected and forlorn ambassadors of the kingdom, this self-appointed chief of communication and intelligence took leave of the apostles. On his way from the upper chamber he dropped the bag of Judas, containing all the apostolic funds, in the lap of <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew Levi</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_4">190:1.4</a></small></sup>  It was about half past nine o’clock when <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s twenty-six messengers arrived at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>. David promptly assembled them in the spacious courtyard and addressed them:</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_5">190:1.5</a></small></sup>  “Men and brethren, all this time you have served me in accordance with your oath to me and to one another, and I call you to witness that I have never yet sent out false information at your hands. I am about to send you on your last mission as volunteer <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom, and in so doing I release you from your <a href="/en/topic/oaths">oaths</a> and thereby disband the <a href="/en/topic/messenger_corps_(Lanonandek)">messenger corps</a>. Men, I declare to you that we have finished our work. No more does the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> have need of mortal messengers; he has risen from the dead. He told us before they arrested him that he would die and rise again on the <a href="/en/topic/third_day">third day</a>. I have seen the tomb—it is empty. I have talked with <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> and four other women, who have talked with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. I now disband you, bid you farewell, and send you on your respective assignments, and the message which you shall bear to the believers is: ‘Jesus has risen from the dead; the tomb is empty.’”</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_6">190:1.6</a></small></sup>  The majority of those present endeavored to persuade <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> not to do this. But they could not influence him. They then sought to dissuade the messengers, but they would not heed the words of <a href="/en/topic/doubt">doubt</a>. And so, shortly before ten o’clock this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, these twenty-six runners went forth as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> heralds of the mighty truth-fact of the resurrected Jesus. And they started out on this mission as they had on so many others, in fulfillment of their oath to <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> and to one another. These men had great confidence in David. They departed on this assignment without even tarrying to talk with those who had seen Jesus; they took David at his word. The majority of them believed what David had told them, and even those who somewhat doubted, carried the message just as certainly and just as swiftly.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_7">190:1.7</a></small></sup>  The apostles, the spiritual corps of the kingdom, are this day assembled in the upper chamber, where they manifest fear and express doubts, while these laymen, representing the first attempt at the socialization of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s gospel of the brotherhood of man, under the orders of their fearless and efficient leader, go forth to proclaim the risen Savior of a world and a universe. And they engage in this eventful service ere his chosen representatives are willing to believe his word or to accept the evidence of eyewitnesses.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_8">190:1.8</a></small></sup>  These twenty-six were dispatched to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> and to all of the believer centers, from <a href="/en/topic/Beersheba">Beersheba</a> in the south to <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a> in the north; and from <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in the east to <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in the west.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_9">190:1.9</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> had taken leave of his brethren, he went over to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> for his mother, and they then went out to Bethany to join the waiting family of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. David abode there in Bethany with <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> until after they had disposed of their earthly possessions, and he accompanied them on their journey to join their brother, Lazarus, at Philadelphia.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_10">190:1.10</a></small></sup>  In about one week from this time <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> took Mary the mother of Jesus to his home in <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>. <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, Jesus’ eldest brother, remained with his family in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a> remained at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> with <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s sisters. The rest of Jesus’ family returned to <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> left Bethany with Martha and Mary, for <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, early in June, the day after his marriage to <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(sister_of_Jesus)">Ruth</a>, Jesus’ youngest sister.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. JESUS’ APPEARANCE AT BETHANY </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_1">190:2.1</a></small></sup>  From the time of the morontia resurrection until the hour of his spirit ascension on high, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made nineteen separate appearances in visible form to his believers on earth<sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. He did not appear to his enemies nor to those who could not make spiritual use of his manifestation in visible form. His first appearance was to the five women at the tomb; his second, to <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, also at the tomb.</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_2">190:2.2</a></small></sup>  The third appearance occurred about noon of this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Shortly after noontide, Jesus’ oldest brother, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, was standing in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> before the empty tomb of the resurrected brother of <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and Mary, turning over in his mind the news brought to them about one hour previously by the messenger of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>. James had always inclined to believe in his eldest brother’s mission on earth, but he had long since lost contact with Jesus’ work and had drifted into grave doubting regarding the later claims of the apostles that Jesus was the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>. The whole family was startled and well-nigh confounded by the news brought by the messenger. Even as James stood before <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a>’s empty tomb, Mary Magdalene arrived on the scene and was excitedly relating to the family her experiences of the early morning hours at the tomb of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>. Before she had finished, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> and his mother arrived. <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, of course, believed the report, and so did <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> after he had talked with David and <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_3">190:2.3</a></small></sup>  In the meantime, as they looked for James and before they found him, while he stood there in the garden near the tomb, he became aware of a near-by presence, as if someone had touched him on the shoulder; and when he turned to look, he beheld the gradual appearance of a strange form by his side. He was too much amazed to speak and too frightened to flee. And then the strange form spoke, saying: “James, I come to call you to the service of the kingdom. Join earnest hands with your brethren and follow after me.” When James heard his name spoken, he knew that it was his eldest brother, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, who had addressed him. They all had more or less difficulty in recognizing the morontia form of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, but few of them had any trouble recognizing his voice or otherwise identifying his charming personality when he once began to communicate with them.<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_4">190:2.4</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> perceived that Jesus was addressing him, he started to fall to his knees, exclaiming, “My father and my brother,” but Jesus bade him stand while he spoke with him. And they walked through the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> and talked for almost three minutes; talked over experiences of former days and forecast the events of the near future. As they neared the house, Jesus said, “Farewell, James, until I greet you all together.”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_5">190:2.5</a></small></sup>  James rushed into the house, even while they looked for him at <a href="/en/topic/Bethphage">Bethpage</a>, exclaiming: “I have just seen <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and talked with him, visited with him. He is not dead; he has risen! He vanished before me, saying, ‘Farewell until I greet you all together.’” He had scarcely finished speaking when <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> returned, and he retold the experience of meeting Jesus in the garden for the benefit of Jude. And they all began to believe in the resurrection of Jesus. James now announced that he would not return to <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> exclaimed: “He is seen not only by excited women; even stronghearted men have begun to see him. I expect to see him myself.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_6">190:2.6</a></small></sup>  And David did not long wait, for the fourth appearance of Jesus to mortal recognition occurred shortly before two o’clock in this very home of <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, when he appeared visibly before his earthly family and their friends, twenty in all. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> appeared in the open back door, saying: “Peace be upon you. Greetings to those once near me in the flesh and fellowship for my brothers and sisters in the kingdom of heaven. How could you doubt? Why have you lingered so long before choosing to follow the light of truth with a whole heart? Come, therefore, all of you into the fellowship of the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> in the Father’s kingdom.” As they began to recover from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> shock of their amazement and to move toward him as if to embrace him, he vanished from their sight.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_7">190:2.7</a></small></sup>  They all wanted to rush off to the city to tell the doubting apostles about what had happened, but <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> restrained them. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, only, was permitted to return to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s house. James forbade their publishing abroad the fact of this morontia visit because of certain things which <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had said to him as they conversed in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>. But James never revealed more of his visit with the risen Master on this day at the <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> home in <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. AT THE HOME OF JOSEPH </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p3_1">190:3.1</a></small></sup>  The fifth morontia manifestation of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to the recognition of mortal eyes occurred in the presence of some twenty-five women believers assembled at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, at about fifteen minutes past four o’clock on this same <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> had returned to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s house just a few minutes before this appearance. <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, Jesus’ brother, had requested that nothing be said to the apostles concerning the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s appearance at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. He had not asked <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> to refrain from reporting the occurrence to her sister believers. Accordingly, after <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> had pledged all the women to secrecy, she proceeded to relate what had so recently happened while she was with Jesus’ family at Bethany. And she was in the very midst of this thrilling recital when a sudden and solemn hush fell over them; they beheld in their very midst the fully visible form of the risen Jesus. He greeted them, saying: “Peace be upon you<sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>. In the fellowship of the kingdom there shall be neither Jew nor gentile, rich nor poor, free nor bond, man nor woman<sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>. You also are called to publish the good news of the liberty of mankind through the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of sonship with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>. Go to all the world proclaiming this gospel and confirming believers in the faith thereof. And while you do this, forget not to minister to the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a> and strengthen those who are fainthearted and fear-ridden<sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>. And I will be with you always, even to the ends of the earth.” And when he had thus spoken, he vanished from their sight, while the women fell on their faces and worshiped in silence.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p3_2">190:3.2</a></small></sup>  Of the five morontia appearances of Jesus occurring up to this time, Mary Magdalene had witnessed four.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p3_3">190:3.3</a></small></sup>  As a result of sending out the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> during the midforenoon and from the unconscious leakage of intimations concerning this appearance of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s house, word began to come to the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> during the early evening that it was being reported about the city that Jesus had risen, and that many persons were claiming to have seen him. The Sanhedrists were thoroughly aroused by these rumors. After a hasty consultation with <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a> called a meeting of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> to convene at eight o’clock that evening. It was at this meeting that action was taken to throw out of the <a href="/en/topic/synagogues">synagogues</a> any person who made mention of Jesus’ resurrection. It was even suggested that anyone claiming to have seen him should be put to death; this proposal, however, did not come to a vote since the meeting broke up in confusion bordering on actual panic. They had dared to think they were through with Jesus. They were about to discover that their real trouble with the man of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> had just begun.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. APPEARANCE TO THE GREEKS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p4_1">190:4.1</a></small></sup>  About half past four o’clock, at the home of one <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> made his sixth morontia appearance to some forty Greek believers there assembled. While they were engaged in discussing the reports of the Master’s resurrection, he manifested himself in their midst, notwithstanding that the doors were securely fastened, and speaking to them, said: “Peace be upon you. While the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> appeared on earth among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, he came to minister to all men. In the kingdom of my Father there shall be neither Jew nor gentile; you will all be brethren—the sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>. Go you, therefore, to all the world, proclaiming this <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of salvation as you have received it from the ambassadors of the kingdom, and I will fellowship you in the brotherhood of the Father’s sons of faith and truth<sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup>.” And when he had thus charged them, he took leave, and they saw him no more. They remained within the house all evening; they were too much overcome with awe and fear to venture forth. Neither did any of these <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> sleep that night; they stayed awake discussing these things and hoping that the Master might again visit them. Among this group were many of the Greeks who were at <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a> when the soldiers arrested <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and Judas betrayed him with a kiss.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p4_2">190:4.2</a></small></sup>  Rumors of Jesus’ resurrection and reports concerning the many appearances to his followers are spreading rapidly, and the whole city is being wrought up to a high pitch of excitement. Already the Master has appeared to his family, to the women, and to the Greeks, and presently he manifests himself in the midst of the apostles. The <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> is soon to begin the consideration of these new problems which have been so suddenly thrust upon the Jewish rulers. Jesus thinks much about his apostles but desires that they be left alone for a few more hours of solemn reflection and thoughtful consideration before he visits them.</p>

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_2">190:5.2</a></small></sup>  On this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon, about three miles out of Jerusalem and a few minutes before five o’clock, as these two brothers trudged along the road to Emmaus, they talked in great earnestness about Jesus, his teachings, work, and more especially concerning the rumors that his tomb was empty, and that certain of the women had talked with him<sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup>. Cleopas was half a mind to believe these reports, but Jacob was insistent that the whole affair was probably a fraud. While they thus argued and debated as they made their way toward home, the morontia manifestation of Jesus, his seventh appearance, came alongside them as they journeyed on. Cleopas had often heard Jesus teach and had eaten with him at the homes of Jerusalem believers on several occasions. But he did not recognize the Master even when he spoke freely with them.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_3">190:5.3</a></small></sup>  After walking a short way with them, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “What were the words you exchanged so earnestly as I came upon you?” And when Jesus had spoken, they stood still and viewed him with sad surprise. Said <a href="/en/topic/Cleopas_of_Emmaus">Cleopas</a>: “Can it be that you sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and know not the things which have recently happened?” Then asked the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, “What things?” Cleopas replied: “If you do not know about these matters, you are the only one in Jerusalem who has not heard these rumors concerning Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, who was a prophet mighty in word and in deed before <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> and demanded that they crucify him. Now many of us had hoped that it was he who would deliver <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> from the yoke of the gentiles. But that is not all. It is now the <a href="/en/topic/third_day">third day</a> since he was crucified, and certain women have this day amazed us by declaring that very early this morning they went to his tomb and found it empty. And these same women insist that they talked with this man; they maintain that he has risen from the dead. And when the women reported this to the men, two of his apostles ran to the tomb and likewise found it empty”—and here <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> interrupted his brother to say, “but they did not see Jesus<sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_4">190:5.4</a></small></sup>  As they walked along, Jesus said to them: “How slow you are to comprehend the truth!

Do you not recall how this <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> proclaimed the salvation of God for all men, ministering to the sick and afflicted and setting free those who were bound by fear and enslaved by evil? Do you not know that this man of Nazareth told his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, be delivered up to his enemies, who would put him to death, and that he would arise on the third day? Have you not been told all this? And have you never read in the Scriptures concerning this day of salvation for Jew and gentile, where it says that in him shall all the families of the earth be blessed; that he will hear the cry of the needy and save the souls of the poor who seek him; that all nations shall call him blessed?

Soon they drew up in front of their humble dwelling place, and Jesus was about to take leave of them, going on down the road, but they constrained him to come in and abide with them. They insisted that it was near nightfall, and that he tarry with them. Finally Jesus consented, and very soon after they went into the house, they sat down to eat. They gave him the bread to bless, and as he began to break and hand to them, their eyes were opened, and <a href="/en/topic/Cleopas_of_Emmaus">Cleopas</a> recognized that their guest was the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> himself.
