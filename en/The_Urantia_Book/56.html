To the circumscribed minds of time-space <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> the universe may present many problems and situations which apparently portray disharmony and indicate absence of effective co-ordination; but those of us who are able to observe wider stretches of universal phenomena, and who are more experienced in this art of detecting the basic unity which underlies creative <a href="/en/topic/diversity">diversity</a> and of discovering the divine oneness which overspreads all this functioning of plurality, better perceive the divine and single purpose exhibited in all these manifold manifestations of universal creative energy.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. PHYSICAL CO-ORDINATION </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_1">56:1.1</a></small></sup>  The physical or material creation is not infinite, but it is perfectly co-ordinated. There are force, <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a>, and power, but they are all one in origin. The seven <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a> are seemingly dual; the central <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>, triune; but <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> is of single constitution. And Paradise is the actual source of all material universes‚Äîpast, present, and future. But this cosmic derivation is an <i>eternity</i> event; at no <i>time‚Äî</i>past, present, or future‚Äîdoes either space or the material cosmos come forth from the nuclear Isle of Light. As the cosmic source, Paradise functions prior to space and before time; hence would its derivations seem to be orphaned in time and space did they not emerge through the <a href="/en/topic/Unqualified_Absolute">Unqualified Absolute</a>, their ultimate repository in space and their revealer and regulator in time.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_2">56:1.2</a></small></sup>  The Unqualified Absolute upholds the physical universe, while the <a href="/en/topic/Deity_Absolute">Deity Absolute</a> motivates the exquisite overcontrol of all material reality; and both <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a> are functionally unified by the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Absolute">Universal Absolute</a>. This cohesive correlation of the material universe is best understood by all personalities‚Äîmaterial, morontia, absonite, or spiritual‚Äîby the observation of the <a href="/en/topic/gravity">gravity</a> response of all bona fide material reality to the gravity centering on nether Paradise.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_3">56:1.3</a></small></sup>  Gravity unification is universal and unvarying; pure-energy response is likewise universal and inescapable. Pure energy (primordial force) and pure <a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a> are wholly preresponsive to gravity. These primal forces, inhering in the Absolutes, are personally controlled by the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>; hence does all gravity center in the personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father of pure energy and pure spirit and in his supermaterial abode.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_4">56:1.4</a></small></sup>  Pure energy is the ancestor of all relative, nonspirit functional realities, while pure spirit is the potential of the divine and directive overcontrol of all basic energy systems. And these realities, so diverse as manifested throughout space and as observed in the motions of time, are both centered in the person of the Paradise Father. In him they are one‚Äîmust be unified‚Äîbecause <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is one.

The spiritual expressions of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> are correlated with the material levels of creation by the functions of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, by whose spirit-responsive ministry of mind, and in whose physical-directive acts of mind, the spiritual realities of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> and the material repercussions of Deity are correlated the one with the other.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p2_2">56:2.2</a></small></sup>  Mind is the functional endowment of the Infinite Spirit, therefore infinite in potential and universal in bestowal. The primal thought of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> eternalizes in dual expression: the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a> and his Deity equal, the spiritual and Eternal Son. Such duality of eternal <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a> renders the <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the Infinite Spirit, inevitable.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p3_1">56:3.1</a></small></sup>  As the universal mind <a href="/en/topic/gravity">gravity</a> is centered in the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, so does the universal spirit gravity center in the Paradise personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> is one, but to time-space he is revealed in the dual phenomena of pure energy and pure spirit.</p>

<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p3_5">56:3.5</a></small></sup>  Perfected creature existence can be attained, sustained, and eternalized by the <a href="/en/topic/fusion">fusion</a> of self-conscious mind with a fragment of the pre-Trinity spirit endowment of some one of the persons of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>. The mortal mind is the creation of the Sons and Daughters of the Eternal Son and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and, when fused with the Thought Adjuster from the Father, partakes of the threefold spirit endowment of the evolutionary realms.

<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p3_6">56:3.6</a></small></sup>  Spirit must always and ultimately become threefold in expression and Trinity-unified in final realization. Spirit originates from one source through a threefold expression; and in finality it must and does attain its full realization in that divine unification which is experienced in finding <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äîoneness with divinity‚Äîin eternity, and by means of the ministry of the cosmic mind of the infinite expression of the eternal word of the Father‚Äôs universal thought.</p>
