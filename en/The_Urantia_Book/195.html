<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_1">195:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE results of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s preaching on the day of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> were such as to decide the future policies, and to determine the plans, of the majority of the apostles in their efforts to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> was the real founder of the Christian church; <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> carried the Christian message to the gentiles, and the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> believers carried it to the whole <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_2">195:0.2</a></small></sup>  Although the tradition-bound and priest-ridden <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, as a people, refused to accept either <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ gospel of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of man or Peter’s and Paul’s proclamation of the resurrection and ascension of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> (subsequent <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>), the rest of the Roman Empire was found to be receptive to the evolving Christian teachings<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Western_civilization">Western civilization</a> was at this time intellectual, war weary, and thoroughly skeptical of all existing religions and universe philosophies. The peoples of the Western world, the beneficiaries of Greek culture, had a revered tradition of a great past. They could contemplate the inheritance of great accomplishments in philosophy, art, literature, and political progress. But with all these achievements they had no soul-satisfying religion. Their spiritual longings remained unsatisfied.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_3">195:0.3</a></small></sup>  Upon such a stage of human society the teachings of Jesus, embraced in the Christian message, were suddenly thrust. A new order of living was thus presented to the hungry hearts of these Western peoples. This situation meant immediate conflict between the older religious practices and the new Christianized version of Jesus’ message to the world. Such a conflict must result in either decided victory for the new or for the old or in some degree of <i>compromise.</i> History shows that the struggle ended in compromise. Christianity presumed to embrace too much for any one people to assimilate in one or two generations. It was not a simple spiritual appeal, such as Jesus had presented to the souls of men; it early struck a decided attitude on religious rituals, education, magic, medicine, art, literature, law, government, morals, sex regulation, polygamy, and, in limited degree, even slavery. Christianity came not merely as a new religion—something all the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> and all the Orient were waiting for—but as a <i>new order of human society.</i> And as such a pretension it quickly precipitated the social-moral clash of the ages. The ideals of Jesus, as they were reinterpreted by <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy and socialized in Christianity, now boldly challenged the traditions of the human race embodied in the ethics, morality, and religions of Western civilization.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_4">195:0.4</a></small></sup>  At first, <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> won as converts only the lower social and economic strata. But by the beginning of the second century the very best of Greco-Roman culture was increasingly turning to this new order of Christian belief, this new concept of the purpose of living and the goal of existence.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_5">195:0.5</a></small></sup>  How did this new message of Jewish origin, which had almost failed in the land of its birth, so quickly and effectively capture the very best minds of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>? The triumph of Christianity over the philosophic religions and the mystery cults was due to:</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_6">195:0.6</a></small></sup>  1. Organization. <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> was a great organizer and his successors kept up the pace he set.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_7">195:0.7</a></small></sup>  2. <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> was thoroughly Hellenized. It embraced the best in <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy as well as the cream of Hebrew theology.</p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_8">195:0.8</a></small></sup>  3. But best of all, it contained a new and great <i>ideal,</i> the echo of the life bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the reflection of his message of salvation for all mankind.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_9">195:0.9</a></small></sup>  4. The Christian leaders were willing to make such compromises with <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraism</a> that the better half of its adherents were won over to the <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a> cult.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_10">195:0.10</a></small></sup>  5. Likewise did the next and later generations of Christian leaders make such further compromises with paganism that even the Roman emperor <a href="/en/topic/Constantine">Constantine</a> was won to the new religion.</p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_11">195:0.11</a></small></sup>  But the Christians made a shrewd bargain with the pagans in that they adopted the ritualistic pageantry of the pagan while compelling the pagan to accept the Hellenized version of <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Pauline Christianity</a>. They made a better bargain with the pagans than they did with the Mithraic cult, but even in that earlier compromise they came off more than conquerors in that they succeeded in eliminating the gross immoralities and also numerous other reprehensible practices of the Persian mystery.</p>
<p id="p0_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_12">195:0.12</a></small></sup>  Wisely or unwisely, these early leaders of Christianity deliberately compromised the <i>ideals</i> of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in an effort to save and further many of his <i>ideas.</i> And they were eminently successful. But mistake not! these compromised ideals of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> are still latent in his gospel, and they will eventually assert their full power upon the world.</p>
<p id="p0_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_13">195:0.13</a></small></sup>  By this <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganization of Christianity</a> the old order won many minor victories of a ritualistic nature, but the Christians gained the ascendancy in that:</p>
<p id="p0_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_14">195:0.14</a></small></sup>  1. A new and enormously higher note in human morals was struck.</p>
<p id="p0_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_15">195:0.15</a></small></sup>  2. A new and greatly enlarged concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> was given to the world.</p>
<p id="p0_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_16">195:0.16</a></small></sup>  3. The hope of immortality became a part of the assurance of a recognized religion.</p>
<p id="p0_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_17">195:0.17</a></small></sup>  4. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> was given to man’s hungry soul.</p>
<p id="p0_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_18">195:0.18</a></small></sup>  Many of the great truths taught by Jesus were almost lost in these early compromises, but they yet slumber in this religion of <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganized Christianity</a>, which was in turn the Pauline version of the life and teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. And <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, even before it was paganized, was first thoroughly Hellenized. Christianity owes much, very much, to the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>. It was a Greek, from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, who so bravely stood up at <a href="/en/topic/Nicaea">Nicaea</a> and so fearlessly challenged this assembly that it dared not so obscure the concept of the nature of Jesus that the real truth of his bestowal might have been in danger of being lost to the world. This Greek’s name was <a href="/en/topic/Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, and but for the eloquence and the logic of this believer, the persuasions of <a href="/en/topic/Arius">Arius</a> would have triumphed.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. INFLUENCE OF THE GREEKS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_1">195:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Hellenization of Christianity</a> started in earnest on that eventful day when the Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> stood before the council of the <a href="/en/topic/Areopagus">Areopagus</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Athens">Athens</a> and told the Athenians about “the Unknown <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.” There, under the shadow of the <a href="/en/topic/Acropolis">Acropolis</a>, this Roman citizen proclaimed to these <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> his version of the new religion which had taken origin in the Jewish land of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a><sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. And there was something strangely alike in Greek philosophy and many of the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. They had a common goal—both aimed at the <i>emergence of the <a href="/en/topic/individual">individual</a>.</i> The Greek, at social and political emergence; Jesus, at moral and spiritual emergence. The Greek taught intellectual liberalism leading to political freedom; Jesus taught spiritual liberalism leading to religious <a href="/en/topic/liberty">liberty</a>. These two ideas put together constituted a new and mighty charter for human freedom; they presaged man’s social, political, and spiritual liberty.</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_2">195:1.2</a></small></sup>  Christianity came into existence and triumphed over all contending religions primarily because of two things:</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_3">195:1.3</a></small></sup>  1. The <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> mind was willing to borrow new and good ideas even from the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_4">195:1.4</a></small></sup>  2. <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> and his successors were willing but shrewd and sagacious compromisers; they were keen theologic traders.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_5">195:1.5</a></small></sup>  At the time Paul stood up in <a href="/en/topic/Athens">Athens</a> preaching “<a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> and Him Crucified,” the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> were spiritually hungry; they were inquiring, interested, and actually looking for spiritual truth<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. Never forget that at first the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> fought <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, while the Greeks embraced it, and that it was the Greeks who literally forced the Romans subsequently to accept this new religion, as then modified, as a part of Greek culture.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_6">195:1.6</a></small></sup>  The Greek revered beauty, the Jew holiness, but both peoples loved truth. For centuries the Greek had seriously thought and earnestly debated about all human problems—social, economic, political, and philosophic—except religion. Few Greeks had paid much attention to religion; they did not take even their own religion very seriously. For centuries the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had neglected these other fields of thought while they devoted their minds to religion. They took their religion very seriously, too seriously. As illuminated by the content of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ message, the united product of the centuries of the thought of these two peoples now became the driving power of a new order of human society and, to a certain extent, of a new order of human religious belief and practice.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_7">195:1.7</a></small></sup>  The influence of Greek culture had already penetrated the lands of the western <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> when <a href="/en/topic/Alexander_of_Cyrene">Alexander</a> spread Hellenistic civilization over the near-Eastern world. The <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> did very well with their religion and their politics as long as they lived in small city-states, but when the Macedonian king dared to expand <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a> into an empire, stretching from the Adriatic to the <a href="/en/topic/Indus">Indus</a>, trouble began. The art and philosophy of Greece were fully equal to the task of imperial expansion, but not so with Greek political administration or religion. After the city-states of Greece had expanded into empire, their rather parochial gods seemed a little queer. The Greeks were really searching for <i>one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>,</i> a greater and better God, when the Christianized version of the older <a href="/en/topic/Jewish_religion">Jewish religion</a> came to them.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_8">195:1.8</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Hellenistic_Empire">Hellenistic Empire</a>, as such, could not endure. Its cultural sway continued on, but it endured only after securing from the West the Roman political genius for empire administration and after obtaining from the East a religion whose one God possessed empire dignity.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_9">195:1.9</a></small></sup>  In <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> century after <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, Hellenistic culture had already attained its highest levels; its retrogression had begun; learning was advancing but genius was declining. It was at this very time that the ideas and ideals of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, which were partially embodied in <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, became a part of the salvage of <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture and learning.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_10">195:1.10</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Alexander_of_Cyrene">Alexander</a> had charged on the East with the cultural gift of the civilization of <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> assaulted the West with the Christian version of the gospel of Jesus. And wherever the Greek culture prevailed throughout the West, there Hellenized Christianity took root.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_11">195:1.11</a></small></sup>  The Eastern version of the message of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, notwithstanding that it remained more true to his teachings, continued to follow the uncompromising attitude of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>. It never progressed as did the Hellenized version and was eventually lost in the Islamic movement.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE ROMAN INFLUENCE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_1">195:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> bodily took over <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture, putting representative government in the place of government <a href="/en/topic/casting_lots">by lot</a>. And presently this change favored <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> in that <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> brought into the whole Western world a new tolerance for strange languages, peoples, and even religions.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_2">195:2.2</a></small></sup>  Much of the early <a href="/en/topic/persecution">persecution</a> of Christians in Rome was due solely to their unfortunate use of the term “kingdom” in their preaching. The Romans were tolerant of any and all religions but very resentful of anything that savored of political rivalry. And so, when these early persecutions, due so largely to misunderstanding, died out, the field for religious propaganda was wide open. The Roman was interested in political administration; he cared little for either art or religion, but he was unusually tolerant of both.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_3">195:2.3</a></small></sup>  Oriental <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> was stern and arbitrary; <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> law was fluid and artistic; Roman law was dignified and respect-breeding. Roman education bred an unheard-of and stolid <a href="/en/topic/loyalty">loyalty</a>. The early <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> were politically devoted and sublimely consecrated individuals. They were honest, zealous, and dedicated to their ideals, but without a religion worthy of the name. Small wonder that their Greek teachers were able to persuade them to accept <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Paul’s Christianity</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_4">195:2.4</a></small></sup>  And these Romans were a great people. They could govern the Occident because they did govern themselves. Such unparalleled honesty, devotion, and stalwart self-control was ideal soil for the reception and growth of Christianity.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_5">195:2.5</a></small></sup>  It was easy for these Greco-Romans to become just as spiritually devoted to an institutional church as they were politically devoted to the state. The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> fought the church only when they feared it as a competitor of the state. <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, having little national philosophy or native culture, took over <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture for its own and boldly adopted <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> as its moral philosophy. <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> became the moral culture of Rome but hardly its religion in the sense of being the individual experience in spiritual growth of those who embraced the new religion in such a wholesale manner. True, indeed, many individuals did penetrate beneath the surface of all this state religion and found for the nourishment of their souls the real values of the hidden meanings held within the latent truths of Hellenized and <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganized Christianity</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_6">195:2.6</a></small></sup>  The Stoic and his sturdy appeal to “nature and conscience” had only the better prepared all Rome to receive Christ, at least in an intellectual sense. The Roman was by nature and training a lawyer; he revered even the laws of nature. And now, in Christianity, he discerned in the laws of nature the laws of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. A people that could produce <a href="/en/topic/Cicero">Cicero</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Vergil">Vergil</a> were ripe for <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>’s Hellenized Christianity.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_7">195:2.7</a></small></sup>  And so did these Romanized <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> force both <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and Christians to philosophize their religion, to co-ordinate its ideas and systematize its ideals, to adapt religious practices to the existing current of life. And all this was enormously helped by translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek and by the later recording of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Testament">New Testament</a> in the Greek tongue.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_8">195:2.8</a></small></sup>  The Greeks, in contrast with the Jews and many other peoples, had long provisionally believed in immortality, some sort of survival after death, and since this was the very heart of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teaching, it was certain that <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> would make a strong appeal to them.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_9">195:2.9</a></small></sup>  A succession of Greek-cultural and Roman-political victories had consolidated the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> lands into one empire, with one <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> and one culture, and had made the Western world ready for one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Judaism">Judaism</a> provided this God, but Judaism was not acceptable as a religion to these Romanized <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>. Philo helped some to mitigate their objections, but Christianity revealed to them an even better concept of one God, and they embraced it readily.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_1">195:3.1</a></small></sup>  After the consolidation of Roman political rule and after the dissemination of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, the Christians found themselves with one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, a great religious concept, but without empire. The Greco-Romans found themselves with a great empire but without a God to serve as the suitable religious concept for empire worship and spiritual unification. The Christians accepted the empire; the empire adopted Christianity. The Roman provided a unity of political rule; the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, a unity of culture and learning; Christianity, a unity of religious thought and practice.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_2">195:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> overcame the tradition of <a href="/en/topic/nationalism">nationalism</a> by imperial universalism and for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time in <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> made it possible for different races and nations at least nominally to accept <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Catholic_Church">one religion</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_3">195:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> came into favor in Rome at a time when there was great contention between the vigorous teachings of the Stoics and the salvation promises of the <a href="/en/topic/mystery_cults">mystery cults</a>. Christianity came with refreshing comfort and liberating power to a spiritually hungry people whose <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> had no word for “<a href="/en/topic/altruism">unselfishness</a>.”</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_4">195:3.4</a></small></sup>  That which gave greatest power to Christianity was the way its believers lived lives of service and even the way they died for their faith during the earlier times of drastic <a href="/en/topic/persecution">persecution</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_5">195:3.5</a></small></sup>  The teaching regarding <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>’s love for <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a> soon put an end to the widespread practice of exposing children to death when they were not wanted, particularly girl babies<sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

Christianity adopted the emperor; later, he adopted Christianity. This was a great age for the spread of a new religion.

<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_8">195:3.8</a></small></sup>  The spiritual impetus of nominally accepting Hellenized Christianity came to <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> too late to prevent the well-started moral decline or to compensate for the already well-established and increasing racial deterioration.

<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_9">195:3.9</a></small></sup>  Even a good religion could not save a great empire from the sure results of lack of individual participation in the affairs of <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>, from overmuch paternalism, overtaxation and gross collection abuses, unbalanced trade with the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a> which drained away the gold, amusement madness, Roman standardization, the degradation of woman, <a href="/en/topic/slavery">slavery</a> and race decadence, physical plagues, and a state church which became institutionalized nearly to the point of spiritual barrenness.</p>

In a spiritual sense, <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> was hibernating. Throughout this period there existed, alongside this slumbering and secularized religion, a continuous stream of <a href="/en/topic/mysticism">mysticism</a>, a fantastic spiritual experience bordering on unreality and philosophically akin to pantheism.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_2">195:4.2</a></small></sup>  During these dark and despairing centuries, religion became virtually secondhanded again. The individual was almost lost before the overshadowing authority, tradition, and dictation of the church. A new spiritual menace arose in the creation of a galaxy of “<a href="/en/topic/saints">saints</a>” who were assumed to have special influence at the divine courts, and who, therefore, if effectively appealed to, would be able to intercede in man’s behalf before the Gods.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_3">195:4.3</a></small></sup>  But <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> was sufficiently socialized and paganized that, while it was impotent to stay the oncoming <a href="/en/topic/dark_ages">dark ages</a>, it was the better prepared to survive this long period of moral darkness and spiritual stagnation.

Such a pedigree is indicative of inherent vitality and the possession of vast recuperative resources. And this same Christianity is now present in the civilized world of Occidental peoples and stands face to face with a struggle for existence which is even more ominous than those eventful crises which have characterized its past battles for dominance.</p>

The higher a civilization climbs, the more necessitous becomes the duty to “seek first the realities of heaven” in all of man’s efforts to stabilize society and facilitate the solution of its material problems<sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_2">195:5.2</a></small></sup>  Truth often becomes confusing and even misleading when it is dismembered, segregated, isolated, and too much analyzed. Living <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> teaches the truth seeker aright only when it is embraced in wholeness and as a living spiritual reality, not as a fact of material science or an inspiration of intervening art.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_3">195:5.3</a></small></sup>  Religion is the revelation to man of his divine and eternal destiny. Religion is a purely personal and spiritual experience and must forever be distinguished from man’s other high forms of thought, such as:</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_4">195:5.4</a></small></sup>  1. Man’s logical attitude toward the things of material reality.</p>

<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_8">195:5.8</a></small></sup>  Religion is designed to find those values in the universe which call forth faith, trust, and assurance; <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> culminates in worship. Religion discovers for the soul those supreme values which are in contrast with the relative values discovered by the mind. Such superhuman insight can be had only through genuine religious experience.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_9">195:5.9</a></small></sup>  A lasting social system without a morality predicated on spiritual realities can no more be maintained than could the solar system without gravity.</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_10">195:5.10</a></small></sup>  Do not try to satisfy the <a href="/en/topic/curiosity">curiosity</a> or gratify all the latent <a href="/en/topic/adventure">adventure</a> surging within the soul in one short life in the flesh. Be patient! be not tempted to indulge in a lawless plunge into cheap and sordid adventure.

<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_11">195:5.11</a></small></sup>  In confusion over man’s origin, do not lose sight of his eternal destiny.

<p id="p5_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_12">195:5.12</a></small></sup>  As you view the world, remember that the black patches of <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> which you see are shown against a white background of ultimate good.

<p id="p5_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_13">195:5.13</a></small></sup>  When there is so much good truth to publish and proclaim, why should men dwell so much upon the evil in the world just because it appears to be a fact? The beauties of the spiritual values of truth are more pleasurable and uplifting than is the phenomenon of evil.</p>
<p id="p5_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_14">195:5.14</a></small></sup>  In religion, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> advocated and followed the method of experience, even as modern science pursues the technique of experiment.

<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. MATERIALISM </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_1">195:6.1</a></small></sup>  Scientists have unintentionally precipitated mankind into a materialistic panic; they have started an unthinking run on the moral <a href="/en/topic/bank_(moral)">bank</a> of the ages, but this bank of human experience has vast spiritual resources; it can stand the demands being made upon it. Only unthinking men become panicky about the spiritual assets of the human race. When the materialistic-secular panic is over, the religion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> will not be found bankrupt. The spiritual bank of the kingdom of heaven will be paying out faith, hope, and moral security to all who draw upon it “in His name.”</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_2">195:6.2</a></small></sup>  No matter what the apparent conflict between <a href="/en/topic/materialism">materialism</a> and the teachings of Jesus may be, you can rest assured that, in the ages to come, the teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> will fully triumph. In reality, true <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> cannot become involved in any controversy with science; it is in no way concerned with material things. Religion is simply indifferent to, but sympathetic with, science, while it supremely concerns itself with the <i>scientist.</i></p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_3">195:6.3</a></small></sup>  The pursuit of mere <a href="/en/topic/knowledge">knowledge</a>, without the attendant interpretation of wisdom and the spiritual insight of religious experience, eventually leads to <a href="/en/topic/pessimism">pessimism</a> and human despair. A little knowledge is truly disconcerting.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4">195:6.4</a></small></sup>  At the time of this writing the worst of the materialistic age is over; the day of a better understanding is already beginning to dawn. The higher minds of the scientific world are no longer wholly materialistic in their philosophy, but the rank and file of the people still lean in that direction as a result of former teachings. But this age of physical realism is only a passing episode in man’s life on earth. Modern <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a> has left true religion—the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as translated in the lives of his believers—untouched. All science has done is to destroy the childlike <a href="/en/topic/illusions">illusions</a> of the misinterpretations of life.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_5">195:6.5</a></small></sup>  Science is a quantitative experience, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> a qualitative experience, as regards man’s life on earth. Science deals with phenomena; religion, with origins, values, and goals. To assign <i>causes</i> as an explanation of physical phenomena is to confess ignorance of ultimates and in the end only leads the scientist straight back to <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> great cause—the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_6">195:6.6</a></small></sup>  The violent swing from an age of miracles to an age of machines has proved altogether upsetting to man. The cleverness and dexterity of the false philosophies of <a href="/en/topic/mechanism_(theory)">mechanism</a> belie their very mechanistic contentions. The fatalistic agility of the mind of a materialist forever disproves his assertions that the universe is a blind and purposeless energy phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_7">195:6.7</a></small></sup>  The mechanistic naturalism of some supposedly educated men and the thoughtless <a href="/en/topic/secularism">secularism</a> of the man in the street are both exclusively concerned with <i>things;</i> they are barren of all real values, sanctions, and satisfactions of a spiritual nature, as well as being devoid of faith, hope, and eternal assurances. One of the great troubles with modern life is that man thinks he is too busy to find time for spiritual <a href="/en/topic/meditation">meditation</a> and religious devotion.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_8">195:6.8</a></small></sup>  Materialism reduces man to a soulless automaton and constitutes him merely an arithmetical symbol finding a helpless place in the mathematical formula of an unromantic and mechanistic universe. But whence comes all this vast universe of mathematics without a <a href="/en/topic/Master_Mathematician">Master Mathematician</a>? Science may expatiate on the conservation of matter, but religion validates the conservation of men’s souls—it concerns their experience with spiritual realities and eternal values.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_9">195:6.9</a></small></sup>  The materialistic sociologist of today surveys a community, makes a report thereon, and leaves the people as he found them. Nineteen hundred years ago, unlearned Galileans surveyed <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> giving his life as a spiritual contribution to man’s inner experience and then went out and turned the whole <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> upside down<sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p6_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_10">195:6.10</a></small></sup>  But religious leaders are making a great mistake when they try to call modern man to spiritual battle with the trumpet blasts of the <a href="/en/topic/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Religion must provide itself with new and up-to-date <a href="/en/topic/slogans">slogans</a>. Neither democracy nor any other political panacea will take the place of spiritual progress. False religions may represent an evasion of reality, but Jesus in his gospel introduced mortal man to the very entrance upon an eternal reality of spiritual progression.</p>
<p id="p6_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_11">195:6.11</a></small></sup>  To say that mind “emerged” from matter explains nothing. If the universe were merely a <a href="/en/topic/mechanism_(theory)">mechanism</a> and mind were unapart from matter, we would never have two differing interpretations of any observed phenomenon. The concepts of <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/beauty">beauty</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a> are not inherent in either <a href="/en/topic/physics">physics</a> or <a href="/en/topic/chemistry">chemistry</a>. A machine cannot <i>know,</i> much less know truth, hunger for righteousness, and cherish goodness.</p>
<p id="p6_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_12">195:6.12</a></small></sup>  Science may be physical, but the mind of the truth-discerning scientist is at once supermaterial. Matter knows not truth, neither can it love mercy nor delight in spiritual realities. Moral convictions based on spiritual enlightenment and rooted in human experience are just as real and certain as mathematical deductions based on physical observations, but on another and higher level.</p>
<p id="p6_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_13">195:6.13</a></small></sup>  If men were only <a href="/en/topic/machines">machines</a>, they would react more or less uniformly to a material universe. Individuality, much less <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a>, would be nonexistent.</p>
<p id="p6_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_14">195:6.14</a></small></sup>  The fact of the absolute <a href="/en/topic/mechanism_(theory)">mechanism</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> at the center of the universe of universes, in the presence of the unqualified volition of the <a href="/en/topic/Second_Source_and_Center">Second Source and Center</a>, makes forever certain that determiners are not the exclusive law of the cosmos. Materialism is there, but it is not exclusive; mechanism is there, but it is not unqualified; <a href="/en/topic/determinism">determinism</a> is there, but it is not alone.</p>
<p id="p6_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_15">195:6.15</a></small></sup>  The finite universe of matter would eventually become uniform and deterministic but for the combined presence of mind and spirit. The influence of the <a href="/en/topic/cosmic_mind">cosmic mind</a> constantly injects <a href="/en/topic/spontaneity">spontaneity</a> into even the material worlds.</p>
<p id="p6_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_16">195:6.16</a></small></sup>  Freedom or <a href="/en/topic/initiative">initiative</a> in any realm of existence is directly proportional to the degree of spiritual influence and cosmic-mind control; that is, in human experience, the degree of the actuality of doing “the Father’s will<sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>.” And so, when you once start out to find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, that is the conclusive proof that God has already found you.</p>
<p id="p6_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_17">195:6.17</a></small></sup>  The sincere pursuit of <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a>, <a href="/en/topic/beauty">beauty</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> leads to God.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_1">195:7.1</a></small></sup>  How foolish it is for material-minded man to allow such vulnerable <a href="/en/topic/theories">theories</a> as those of a mechanistic universe to deprive him of the vast spiritual resources of the personal experience of true religion. <a href="/en/topic/facts">Facts</a> never quarrel with real spiritual <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>; theories may. Better that science should be devoted to the destruction of <a href="/en/topic/superstition">superstition</a> rather than attempting the overthrow of religious faith—human belief in spiritual realities and divine values.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_2">195:7.2</a></small></sup>  Science should do for man materially what religion does for him spiritually: extend the horizon of life and enlarge his personality. True <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a> can have no lasting quarrel with true religion. The “scientific method” is merely an intellectual yardstick wherewith to measure material adventures and physical achievements. But being material and wholly intellectual, it is utterly useless in the evaluation of spiritual realities and religious experiences.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_3">195:7.3</a></small></sup>  The inconsistency of the modern mechanist is: If this were merely a material universe and man only a machine, such a man would be wholly unable to recognize himself as such a machine, and likewise would such a machine-man be wholly unconscious of the fact of the existence of such a material universe. The materialistic dismay and despair of a mechanistic science has failed to recognize the fact of the spirit-indwelt mind of the scientist whose very supermaterial insight formulates these mistaken and self-contradictory <i>concepts</i> of a materialistic universe.</p>

<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_5">195:7.5</a></small></sup>  The realities and values of spiritual progress are not a “psychologic projection”—a mere glorified daydream of the material mind.

This very <i>mechanistic concept</i> of the universe is in itself a nonmaterial phenomenon of mind, and all mind is of nonmaterial origin, no matter how thoroughly it may appear to be materially conditioned and mechanistically controlled.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_7">195:7.7</a></small></sup>  The partially evolved mental <a href="/en/topic/mechanism_(theory)">mechanism</a> of mortal man is not overendowed with consistency and wisdom.

Both optimism and pessimism are concept reactions in a mind conscious of <i>values</i> as well as of <i>facts.</i> If the universe were truly what the materialist regards it to be, man as a human machine would then be devoid of all conscious recognition of that very <i>fact.</i> Without the consciousness of the concept of <i>values</i> within the spirit-born mind, the fact of universe <a href="/en/topic/materialism">materialism</a> and the mechanistic phenomena of universe operation would be wholly unrecognized by man.

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_1">195:8.1</a></small></sup>  But even after materialism and mechanism have been more or less vanquished, the devastating influence of twentieth-century <a href="/en/topic/secularism">secularism</a> will still blight the spiritual experience of millions of unsuspecting souls.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_2">195:8.2</a></small></sup>  Modern secularism has been fostered by two world-wide influences. The father of secularism was the narrow-minded and godless attitude of nineteenth- and twentieth-century so-called <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a>—atheistic science. The mother of modern secularism was the totalitarian medieval Christian church. Secularism had its inception as a rising protest against the almost complete domination of <a href="/en/topic/Western_civilization">Western civilization</a> by the institutionalized Christian church.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_3">195:8.3</a></small></sup>  At the time of this revelation, the prevailing intellectual and philosophical climate of both <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> and American life is decidedly secular—humanistic. For three hundred years Western thinking has been progressively secularized. Religion has become more and more a nominal influence, largely a ritualistic exercise. The majority of professed Christians of Western civilization are unwittingly actual secularists.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_4">195:8.4</a></small></sup>  It required a great power, a mighty influence, to free the thinking and living of the Western peoples from the withering grasp of a totalitarian ecclesiastical domination. Secularism did break the bonds of church control, and now in turn it threatens to establish a new and godless type of mastery over the hearts and minds of modern man. The tyrannical and dictatorial political state is the direct offspring of scientific materialism and philosophic <a href="/en/topic/secularism">secularism</a>. Secularism no sooner frees man from the domination of the institutionalized church than it sells him into slavish bondage to the totalitarian state. Secularism frees man from ecclesiastical <a href="/en/topic/slavery">slavery</a> only to betray him into the tyranny of political and economic slavery.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_5">195:8.5</a></small></sup>  Materialism denies <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, secularism simply ignores him; at least that was the earlier attitude. More recently, secularism has assumed a more militant attitude, assuming to take the place of the religion whose totalitarian bondage it onetime resisted<sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>. Twentieth-century secularism tends to affirm that man does not need God. But beware! this godless philosophy of human society will lead only to unrest, animosity, unhappiness, <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a>, and world-wide disaster.</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_6">195:8.6</a></small></sup>  Secularism can never bring peace to mankind. Nothing can take the place of God in human society.

The great mistake of <a href="/en/topic/secularism">secularism</a> was this: In revolting against the almost total control of life by religious authority, and after attaining the liberation from such ecclesiastical tyranny, the secularists went on to institute a revolt against God himself, sometimes tacitly and sometimes openly.</p>
<p id="p8_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_7">195:8.7</a></small></sup>  To the secularistic revolt you owe the amazing creativity of American industrialism and the unprecedented material progress of Western civilization.

The religion of Jesus does, indeed, dominate and transform its believers, demanding that men dedicate their lives to seeking for a knowledge of the will of the Father in heaven and requiring that the energies of living be consecrated to the unselfish <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> of the brotherhood of man.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_7">195:9.7</a></small></sup>  Selfish men and women simply will not pay such a price for even the greatest spiritual treasure ever offered mortal man.

<p id="p10_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11">195:10.11</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> is seriously confronted with the doom embodied in one of its own slogans: “A house divided against itself cannot stand<sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup>.” The non-Christian world will hardly capitulate to a sect-divided Christendom. The living <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true <a href="/en/topic/churches">church</a>—the Jesus brotherhood—is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by <i>unity,</i> not necessarily by <i>uniformity.</i> Uniformity is the earmark of the physical world of mechanistic nature. Spiritual unity is the fruit of faith union with the living Jesus. The visible church should refuse longer to handicap the progress of the invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. And this brotherhood is destined to become a <i>living organism</i> in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them.</p>
<p id="p10_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_12">195:10.12</a></small></sup>  But the Christianity of even the twentieth century must not be despised. It is the product of the combined moral genius of the God-knowing men of many races during many ages, and it has truly been one of the greatest powers for good on earth, and therefore no man should lightly regard it, notwithstanding its inherent and acquired defects. Christianity still contrives to move the minds of reflective men with mighty moral emotions.</p>
<p id="p10_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_13">195:10.13</a></small></sup>  But there is no excuse for the involvement of the church in commerce and politics; such unholy alliances are a flagrant betrayal of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. And the genuine lovers of truth will be slow to forget that this powerful institutionalized church has often dared to smother newborn faith and persecute truth bearers who chanced to appear in unorthodox raiment.</p>
<p id="p10_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_14">195:10.14</a></small></sup>  It is all too true that such a church would not have survived unless there had been men in the world who preferred such a style of worship. Many spiritually indolent souls crave an ancient and authoritative <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of ritual and sacred traditions. Human evolution and spiritual progress are hardly sufficient to enable all men to dispense with religious authority. And the invisible brotherhood of the kingdom may well include these family groups of various social and temperamental classes if they are only willing to become truly spirit-led sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. But in this brotherhood of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> there is no place for sectarian rivalry, group bitterness, nor assertions of moral superiority and spiritual infallibility.</p>
<p id="p10_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_15">195:10.15</a></small></sup>  These various groupings of Christians may serve to accommodate numerous different types of would-be believers among the various peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Western_civilization">Western civilization</a>, but such division of Christendom presents a grave weakness when it attempts to carry the gospel of Jesus to Oriental peoples. These races do not yet understand that there is a <i>religion of Jesus</i> separate, and somewhat apart, from <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, which has more and more become a <i>religion about Jesus.</i></p>
<p id="p10_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_16">195:10.16</a></small></sup>  The great hope of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> lies in the possibility of a new revelation of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous families of his present-day professed followers.</p>
<p id="p10_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_17">195:10.17</a></small></sup>  Even secular <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> could help in this great spiritual renaissance if it would pay more attention to the work of teaching youth how to engage in life planning and character progression. The purpose of all education should be to foster and further the supreme purpose of life, the development of a majestic and well-balanced personality. There is great need for the teaching of moral discipline in the place of so much <a href="/en/topic/self-gratification">self-gratification</a>. Upon such a foundation religion may contribute its spiritual incentive to the enlargement and enrichment of mortal life, even to the security and enhancement of life eternal.</p>
<p id="p10_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_18">195:10.18</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> is an extemporized religion, and therefore must it operate in low gear. High-gear spiritual performances must await the new revelation and the more general acceptance of the real religion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. But Christianity is a mighty religion, seeing that the commonplace disciples of a crucified carpenter set in motion those teachings which conquered the Roman world in three hundred years and then went on to triumph over the barbarians who overthrew <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. This same Christianity conquered—absorbed and exalted—the whole stream of Hebrew theology and <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy. And then, when this Christian religion became comatose for more than a thousand years as a result of an overdose of mysteries and paganism, it resurrected itself and virtually reconquered the whole Western world. Christianity contains enough of Jesus’ teachings to immortalize it.</p>
<p id="p10_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_19">195:10.19</a></small></sup>  If Christianity could only grasp more of Jesus’ teachings, it could do so much more in helping modern man to solve his new and increasingly complex problems.</p>
<p id="p10_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_20">195:10.20</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> suffers under a great handicap because it has become identified in the minds of all the world as a part of the social system, the industrial life, and the moral standards of <a href="/en/topic/Western_civilization">Western civilization</a>; and thus has Christianity unwittingly seemed to sponsor a society which staggers under the guilt of tolerating science without idealism, politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without restraint, knowledge without character, power without conscience, and industry without morality.</p>
<p id="p10_21"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21">195:10.21</a></small></sup>  The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear—the living <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of man.</p>
