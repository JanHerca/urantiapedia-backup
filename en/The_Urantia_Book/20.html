<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_10">20:1.10</a></small></sup>  Melchizedeks are the joint offspring of a local universe <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, Creative Spirit, and <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a>. Both Vorondadeks and Lanonandeks are brought into being by a Creator Son and his Creative Spirit associate. Vorondadeks are best known as the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a>; Lanonandeks as <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a> and as <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a>. The threefold order of Life Carriers is brought into being by a Creator Son and Creative Spirit associated with one of the three <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> of the superuniverse of jurisdiction. But the natures and activities of these Local <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Sons">Universe Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> are more properly portrayed in those papers dealing with the affairs of the local creations.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_11">20:1.11</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Sons_of_God">Paradise Sons of God</a> are of threefold origin: The primary or Creator Sons are brought into being by the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>; the secondary or <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> are children of the Eternal Son and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>; the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a> are the offspring of the Father, Son, and Spirit. From the standpoint of service, worship, and supplication the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sons are as one; their spirit is one, and their work is identical in quality and completeness.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_12">20:1.12</a></small></sup>  As the Paradise orders of Days proved to be divine administrators, so have the orders of Paradise Sons revealed themselves as divine ministers—creators, servers, bestowers, judges, teachers, and truth revealers. They range the universe of universes from the shores of the eternal Isle to the inhabited worlds of time and space, performing manifold services in the central and superuniverses not disclosed in these narratives. They are variously organized, dependent on the nature and whereabouts of their service, but in a local universe both Magisterial and Teacher Sons serve under the direction of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> who presides over that domain.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_13">20:1.13</a></small></sup>  The Creator Sons seem to possess a spiritual endowment centering in their persons, which they control and which they can bestow, as did your own Creator Son when he poured out his spirit upon all mortal flesh on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Each Creator Son is endowed with this spiritual drawing power in his own realm; he is personally conscious of every act and emotion of every descending <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a> serving in his domain<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. Here is a divine reflection, a local universe duplication, of that absolute spiritual drawing power of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> which enables him to reach out to make and maintain contact with all his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sons, no matter where they may be in all the universe of universes.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_14">20:1.14</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Creator_Sons">Paradise Creator Sons</a> serve not only as Sons in their descending ministrations of service and bestowal, but when they have completed their bestowal careers, each functions as a universe Father in his own creation, while the other <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> continue the service of bestowal and spiritual uplifting designed to win the planets, one by one, to the willing recognition of the loving rule of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, culminating in creature consecration to the will of the Paradise Father and in planetary loyalty to the universe sovereignty of his Creator Son.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p1_15">20:1.15</a></small></sup>  In a sevenfold Creator Son, Creator and creature are forever blended in understanding, sympathetic, and merciful association. The entire <a href="/en/topic/Michael,_order_of">order of Michael</a>, the Creator Sons, is so unique that the consideration of their natures and activities will be reserved to the next paper in this series, while this narrative will be chiefly concerned with the two remaining orders of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> sonship: the <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE MAGISTERIAL SONS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_1">20:2.1</a></small></sup>  Every time an original and absolute concept of being formulated by the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> unites with a new and divine ideal of loving service conceived by the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, a new and original <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>, a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Magisterial Son, is produced. These Sons constitute the order of Avonals in contradistinction to the order of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a>. Though not creators in the personal sense, they are closely associated with the <a href="/en/topic/Michael,_order_of">Michaels</a> in all their work. The Avonals are planetary ministers and judges, the magistrates of the time-space realms—of all races, to all worlds, and in all universes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_2">20:2.2</a></small></sup>  We have reasons for believing that the total number of <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> in the grand universe is about one billion. They are a self-governing order, being directed by their <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Lanonandek_councils">supreme council</a> on Paradise, which is made up of experienced Avonals drawn from the services of all universes. But when assigned to, and commissioned in, a local universe, they serve under the direction of the Creator Son of that domain.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_3">20:2.3</a></small></sup>  Avonals are the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Paradise Sons</a> of service and bestowal to the individual planets of the local universes. And since each Avonal Son has an exclusive personality, since no two are alike, their work is individually unique in the realms of their sojourn, where they are often incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh and sometimes are born of earthly mothers on the evolutionary worlds.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_4">20:2.4</a></small></sup>  In addition to their services on the higher administrative levels, the Avonals have a threefold function on the inhabited worlds:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_5">20:2.5</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Judicial Actions.</i> They act at the close of the planetary dispensations. In time, scores—hundreds—of such missions may be executed on each individual world, and they may go to the same or to other worlds times without number as dispensation terminators, liberators of the <a href="/en/topic/sleeping_survivors">sleeping survivors</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_6">20:2.6</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Magisterial Missions.</i> A planetary visitation of this type usually occurs prior to the arrival of a bestowal Son. On such a mission an Avonal appears as an adult of the realm by a technique of incarnation not involving mortal birth. Subsequent to this first and usual magisterial visit, Avonals may repeatedly serve in a magisterial capacity on the same planet both before and after the appearance of the bestowal Son. On these additional magisterial missions an Avonal may or may not appear in material and visible form, but on none of them will he be born into the world as a helpless babe.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_7">20:2.7</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Bestowal Missions.</i> The Avonal Sons do all, at least once, bestow themselves upon some mortal race on some evolutionary world. Judicial visits are numerous, magisterial missions may be plural, but on each planet there appears but one bestowal Son. Bestowal Avonals are born of woman as <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael of Nebadon</a> was incarnated on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_8">20:2.8</a></small></sup>  There is no limit to the number of times the Avonal Sons may serve on magisterial and on bestowal missions, but usually, when the experience has been seven times traversed, there is suspension in favor of those who have had less of such service. These Sons of multiple bestowal experience are then assigned to the high personal council of a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, thus becoming participants in the administration of universe affairs.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_9">20:2.9</a></small></sup>  In all their work for and on the inhabited worlds, the <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> are assisted by two orders of local universe creatures, the Melchizedeks and the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>, while on bestowal missions they are also accompanied by the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a>, likewise of origin in the local creations. In every planetary effort the secondary <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sons, the Avonals, are supported by the full power and authority of a primary Paradise Son, the Creator Son of their local universe of service. To all intents and purposes their work on the inhabited spheres is just as effective and acceptable as would have been the service of a Creator Son upon such worlds of mortal habitation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. JUDICIAL ACTIONS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p3_1">20:3.1</a></small></sup>  The Avonals are known as <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> because they are the high magistrates of the realms, the adjudicators of the successive dispensations of the worlds of time. They preside over the awakening of the <a href="/en/topic/sleeping_survivors">sleeping survivors</a>, sit in <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> on the realm, bring to an end a dispensation of suspended justice, execute the mandates of an age of probationary mercy, reassign the space creatures of planetary ministry to the tasks of the new dispensation, and return to the headquarters of their local universe upon the completion of their mission.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p3_2">20:3.2</a></small></sup>  When they sit in judgment on the destinies of an age, the Avonals decree the fate of the evolutionary races, but though they may render judgments extinguishing the identity of personal creatures, they do not execute such sentences. Verdicts of this nature are executed by none but the authorities of a superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p3_3">20:3.3</a></small></sup>  The arrival of a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Avonal on an evolutionary world for the purpose of terminating a dispensation and of inaugurating a new era of planetary progression is not necessarily either a magisterial mission or a bestowal mission. Magisterial missions sometimes, and bestowal missions always, are incarnations; that is, on such assignments the Avonals serve on a planet in material form—literally. Their other visits are “technical,” and in this capacity an Avonal is not incarnated for planetary service. If a Magisterial Son comes solely as a dispensational adjudicator, he arrives on a planet as a spiritual being, invisible to the material creatures of the realm. Such technical visits occur repeatedly in the long history of an inhabited world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p3_4">20:3.4</a></small></sup>  Avonal Sons may act as planetary judges prior to both the magisterial and bestowal experiences. On either of these missions, however, the incarnated Son will <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> the passing planetary age; likewise does a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> when incarnated on a mission of bestowal in the likeness of mortal flesh. When a Paradise Son visits an evolutionary world and becomes like one of its people, his presence terminates a dispensation and constitutes a judgment of the realm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. MAGISTERIAL MISSIONS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_1">20:4.1</a></small></sup>  Prior to the planetary appearance of a bestowal Son, an inhabited world is usually visited by a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Avonal on a magisterial mission. If it is an initial magisterial visitation, the Avonal is always incarnated as a material being. He appears on the planet of assignment as a full-fledged male of the mortal races, a being fully visible to, and in physical contact with, the mortal creatures of his day and generation. Throughout a magisterial incarnation the connection of the Avonal Son with the local and the universal spiritual forces is complete and unbroken.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_2">20:4.2</a></small></sup>  A planet may experience many magisterial visitations both before and after the appearance of a bestowal Son. It may be visited many times by the same or other Avonals, acting as dispensational adjudicators, but such technical missions of judgment are neither bestowal nor magisterial, and the Avonals are never incarnated at such times. Even when a planet is blessed with repeated magisterial missions, the Avonals do not always submit to mortal incarnation; and when they do serve in the likeness of mortal flesh, they always appear as adult beings of the realm; they are not born of woman.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_3">20:4.3</a></small></sup>  When incarnated on either bestowal or magisterial missions, the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Paradise Sons</a> have experienced Adjusters, and these Adjusters are different for each incarnation. The Adjusters that occupy the minds of the incarnated <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> can never hope for personality through fusion with the human-divine beings of their indwelling, but they are often personalized by fiat of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. Such Adjusters form the supreme <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a> council of direction for the administration, identification, and dispatch of <a href="/en/topic/Mystery_Monitors">Mystery Monitors</a> to the inhabited realms. They also receive and accredit Adjusters on their return to the “<a href="/en/topic/bosom_of_the_Father">bosom of the Father</a>” upon the mortal dissolution of their earthly tabernacles<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. In this way the faithful Adjusters of the world judges become the exalted chiefs of their kind.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_4">20:4.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> has never been host to an Avonal Son on a magisterial mission. Had Urantia followed the general plan of inhabited worlds, it would have been blessed with a magisterial mission sometime between the days of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and the bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>.

But your enlightenment should indicate that this is not true. The bestowals of the Avonal and the <a href="/en/topic/Michael_Sons">Michael Sons</a> are a necessary part of the experiential process designed to make these Sons safe and sympathetic magistrates and rulers of the peoples and planets of time and space. The career of sevenfold bestowal is the supreme goal of all <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Creator_Sons">Paradise Creator Sons</a>. And all <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> are motivated by this same spirit of service which so abundantly characterizes the primary <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> and the Eternal Son of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_3">20:5.3</a></small></sup>  Some order of Paradise Son must be bestowed upon each mortal-inhabited world in order to make it possible for <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> to indwell the minds of all normal human beings on that sphere, for the Adjusters do not come to <i>all</i> bona fide human beings until the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> has been poured out upon all flesh; and the sending of the Spirit of Truth is dependent upon the return to universe headquarters of a Paradise Son who has successfully executed a mission of mortal bestowal upon an evolving world.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_4">20:5.4</a></small></sup>  During the course of the long history of an inhabited planet, many dispensational adjudications will take place, and more than one magisterial mission may occur, but ordinarily only once will a bestowal Son serve on the sphere. It is only required that each inhabited world have one bestowal Son come to live the full mortal life from birth to death. Sooner or later, regardless of spiritual status, every mortal-inhabited world is destined to become host to a Magisterial Son on a bestowal mission except the one planet in each local universe whereon a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> elects to make his mortal bestowal.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a22"><a href="#fn_a22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_5">20:5.5</a></small></sup>  Understanding more about the bestowal Sons, you discern why so much interest attaches to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> in the history of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. Your small and insignificant planet is of local universe concern simply because it is the mortal home world of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. It was the scene of the final and triumphant bestowal of your Creator Son, the arena in which <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> won the supreme personal sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_6">20:5.6</a></small></sup>  At the headquarters of his local universe a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, especially after the completion of his own mortal bestowal, spends much of his time in counseling and instructing the college of associate Sons, the <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> and others. In love and devotion, with tender mercy and affectionate consideration, these Magisterial Sons bestow themselves upon the worlds of space. And in no way are these planetary services inferior to the mortal bestowals of the <a href="/en/topic/Michael,_order_of">Michaels</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. It is true that your Creator Son selected for the realm of his final adventure in creature experience one which had had unusual misfortunes. But no planet could ever be in such a condition that it would require the bestowal of a Creator Son to effect its spiritual rehabilitation. Any Son of the bestowal group would have equally sufficed, for in all their work on the worlds of a local universe the Magisterial Sons are just as divinely effective and all wise as would have been their <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> brother, the Creator Son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a23"><a href="#fn_a23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_7">20:5.7</a></small></sup>  Though the possibility of disaster always attends these Paradise Sons during their bestowal incarnations, I have yet to see the record of the failure or default of either a Magisterial or a Creator Son on a mission of bestowal. Both are of origin too close to absolute perfection to fail. They indeed assume the risk, really become like the mortal creatures of flesh and blood and thereby gain the unique creature experience, but within the range of my observation they always succeed. They never fail to achieve the goal of the bestowal mission. The <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of their bestowal and planetary service throughout <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> constitutes the most noble and fascinating chapter in the history of your local universe.</p>

<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_2">20:6.2</a></small></sup>  On a mortal-bestowal mission a Paradise Son is always born of woman and grows up as a male child of the realm, as Jesus did on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. These Sons of supreme service all pass from infancy through youth to manhood just as does a human being. In every respect they become like the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the race into which they are born. They make petitions to the Father as do the children of the realms in which they serve. From a material viewpoint, these human-divine Sons live ordinary lives with just one exception: They do not beget offspring on the worlds of their sojourn; that is a universal restriction imposed on all orders of the Paradise bestowal Sons.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a24"><a href="#fn_a24">[24]</a></sup></p>

But a bestowed Avonal does declare, “Whosoever has seen me has seen the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.” The <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a> are not of immediate descent from the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, nor do they incarnate subject to the Father’s will; always do they bestow themselves as <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> <i>Sons</i> subject to the will of the Eternal Son of Paradise.</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_6">20:6.6</a></small></sup>  When the bestowal Sons, Creator or Magisterial, enter the portals of death, they reappear on the <a href="/en/topic/third_day">third day</a>. But you should not entertain the idea that they always meet with the tragic end encountered by the Creator Son who sojourned on your world nineteen hundred years ago. The extraordinary and unusually cruel experience through which <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> passed has caused Urantia to become locally known as “the <a href="/en/topic/world_of_the_cross">world of the cross</a>.” It is not necessary that such inhuman treatment be accorded a Son of God, and the vast majority of planets have afforded them a more considerate reception, allowing them to finish their mortal careers, terminate the age, adjudicate the sleeping survivors, and inaugurate a new dispensation, without imposing a violent death. A bestowal Son must encounter death, must pass through the whole of the actual experience of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realms, but it is not a requirement of the divine plan that this death be either violent or unusual.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a27"><a href="#fn_a27">[27]</a></sup></p>

Bestowal is a planetary and a universe necessity, and physical death is nothing more than a necessary part of a bestowal mission.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_8">20:6.8</a></small></sup>  When the mortal incarnation is finished, the Avonal of service proceeds to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, is accepted by the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, returns to the local universe of assignment, and is acknowledged by the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>.

<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_9">20:6.9</a></small></sup>  Upon the completion of a Creator Son’s final bestowal the Spirit of Truth previously sent into all Avonal-bestowal worlds of that local universe changes in nature, becoming more literally the spirit of the sovereign Michael. This phenomenon takes place concurrently with the liberation of the Spirit of Truth for service on the Michael-mortal-bestowal planet. Thereafter, each world honored by a Magisterial bestowal will receive the same spirit <a href="/en/topic/Comforter">Comforter</a> from the sevenfold Creator Son, in association with that Magisterial Son, which it would have received had the local universe Sovereign personally incarnated as its bestowal Son.</p>
