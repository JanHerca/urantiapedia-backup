<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p0_1">143:0.1</a></small></sup>  AT THE end of June, A.D. 27, because of the increasing opposition of the Jewish religious rulers, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve departed from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, after sending their tents and meager personal effects to be stored at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Going north into <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, they tarried over the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Bethel">Bethel</a>. Here they preached for several days to the people who came from <a href="/en/topic/Gophna">Gophna</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ephraim">Ephraim</a>. A group of citizens from <a href="/en/topic/Arimathea">Arimathea</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Thamna">Thamna</a> came over to invite Jesus to visit their villages. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his apostles spent more than two weeks teaching the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a> of this region, many of whom came from as far as <a href="/en/topic/Antipatris">Antipatris</a> to hear the good news of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p0_2">143:0.2</a></small></sup>  The people of southern Samaria heard Jesus gladly, and the apostles, with the exception of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, succeeded in overcoming much of their prejudice against the Samaritans. It was very difficult for Judas to love these Samaritans. The last week of July Jesus and his associates made ready to depart for the new <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> cities of <a href="/en/topic/Phasaelis">Phasaelis</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Archelais">Archelais</a> near the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p1_1">143:1.1</a></small></sup>  The first half of the month of August the apostolic party made its headquarters at the Greek cities of <a href="/en/topic/Archelais">Archelais</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Phasaelis">Phasaelis</a>, where they had their first experience preaching to well-nigh exclusive gatherings of gentiles‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, and Syrians‚Äîfor few <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> dwelt in these two Greek towns. In contacting with these Roman citizens, the apostles encountered new difficulties in the proclamation of the message of the coming kingdom, and they met with new objections to the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. At one of the many evening conferences with his apostles, Jesus listened attentively to these objections to the gospel of the kingdom as the twelve repeated their experiences with the subjects of their personal labors.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p1_2">143:1.2</a></small></sup>  A question asked by <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> was typical of their difficulties. Said <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a>: ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, these Greeks and Romans make light of our message, saying that such teachings are fit for only weaklings and slaves. They assert that the religion of the heathen is superior to our teaching because it inspires to the acquirement of a strong, robust, and aggressive character. They affirm that we would convert all men into enfeebled specimens of passive nonresisters who would soon perish from the face of the earth. They like you, Master, and freely admit that your teaching is heavenly and ideal, but they will not take us seriously. They assert that your religion is not for this world; that men cannot live as you teach. And now, Master, what shall we say to these gentiles?‚Äù</p>

But you should not overlook the fact that even divine <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> has its severe disciplines.

But I declare to you that my Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> does rule a universe of universes by the compelling power of his love. Love is the greatest of all spirit realities.

The <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascent is the supreme adventure of all time, the rugged achievement of eternity. The service of the kingdom on earth will call for all the courageous manhood that you and your coworkers can muster. Many of you will be put to <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> for your loyalty to the gospel of this kingdom. It is easy to die in the line of physical battle when your <a href="/en/topic/courage">courage</a> is strengthened by the presence of your fighting comrades, but it requires a higher and more profound form of human courage and devotion calmly and all alone to lay down your life for the love of a truth enshrined in your mortal heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>

No armies of the world have ever displayed more courage and bravery than will be portrayed by you and your loyal successors who shall go forth to all the world proclaiming the good news‚Äîthe fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men. The courage of the flesh is the lowest form of bravery. Mind bravery is a higher type of human courage, but the highest and supreme is uncompromising loyalty to the enlightened convictions of profound spiritual realities. And such courage constitutes the heroism of the God-knowing man.

This was one of the most impassioned addresses which Jesus ever delivered to the twelve. Seldom did the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> speak to his apostles with evident strong feeling, but this was one of those few occasions when he spoke with manifest earnestness, accompanied by marked emotion.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p1_9">143:1.9</a></small></sup>  The result upon the public preaching and personal ministry of the apostles was immediate; from that very day their message took on a new note of courageous dominance. The twelve continued to acquire the spirit of positive aggression in the new <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom. From this day forward they did not occupy themselves so much with the preaching of the negative virtues and the passive injunctions of their Master‚Äôs many-sided teaching.</p>

Wherein does your teaching differ from that of John?‚Äù Jesus answered: ‚ÄúJohn indeed taught you the way of righteousness in accordance with the light and laws of his fathers, and that was the religion of self-examination and self-denial.

Jesus was thirsty, but there was no way of getting water from the well. When, therefore, a woman of Sychar came up with her water pitcher and prepared to draw from the well, Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúGive me a drink<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.‚Äù This woman of <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a> knew Jesus was a Jew by his appearance and dress, and she surmised that he was a Galilean Jew from his accent.

She was much surprised to have a Jewish man thus speak to her at the well and ask for water, for it was not deemed proper in those days for a self-respecting man to speak to a woman in public, much less for a Jew to converse with a Samaritan. Therefore Nalda asked Jesus, ‚ÄúHow is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink of me, a Samaritan woman?‚Äù Jesus answered: ‚ÄúI have indeed asked you for a drink, but if you could only understand, you would ask me for a draught of the living water<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.‚Äù Then said Nalda: ‚ÄúBut, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, have you this living water?

And being a woman of lax morals, she was minded openly to become flirtatious, when Jesus, looking straight into her eyes, with a commanding voice said, ‚ÄúWoman, go get your husband and bring him hither.‚Äù This command brought Nalda to her senses. She saw that she had misjudged the Master‚Äôs kindness; she perceived that she had misconstrued his manner of speech. She was frightened; she began to realize that she stood in the presence of an unusual person, and groping about in her mind for a suitable reply, in great confusion, she said, ‚ÄúBut, Sir, I cannot call my husband, for I have no husband.‚Äù Then said Jesus: ‚ÄúYou have spoken the truth, for, while you may have once had a husband, he with whom you are now living is not your husband.

Nalda now felt greatly ashamed that she had so unthinkingly spoken to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and she most penitently addressed the Master, saying: ‚ÄúMy Lord, I repent of my manner of speaking to you, for I perceive that you are a holy man or maybe a prophet<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>.‚Äù And she was just about to seek direct and personal help from the Master when she did what so many have done before and since‚Äîdodged the issue of personal <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> by turning to the discussion of <a href="/en/topic/theology">theology</a> and <a href="/en/topic/philosophy">philosophy</a>.

Once more she resorted to questions of general religion, saying: ‚ÄúYes, I know, Sir, that John has preached about the coming of the Converter, he who will be called the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>, and that, when he shall come, he will declare to us all things‚Äù‚Äîand <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, interrupting Nalda, said with startling assurance, ‚ÄúI who speak to you am he.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup></p>
