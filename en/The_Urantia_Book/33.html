<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_1">33:3.1</a></small></sup>  While pervading all the universes of time and space, the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> functions from the headquarters of each local universe as a specialized focalization acquiring full personality qualities by the technique of creative co-operation with the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>. As concerns a local universe, the administrative authority of a Creator Son is supreme; the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit, as the Divine Minister, is wholly co-operative though perfectly co-ordinate.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_2">33:3.2</a></small></sup>  The Universe Mother Spirit of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, the associate of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> in the control and administration of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, is of the sixth group of <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Spirits">Supreme Spirits</a>, being the 611,121<sup>st</sup> of that order. She volunteered to accompany <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> on the occasion of his liberation from <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> obligations and has ever since functioned with him in creating and governing his universe.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_3">33:3.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> is the personal sovereign of his universe, but in all the details of its management the Universe Spirit is codirector with the Son. While the Spirit ever acknowledges the Son as sovereign and ruler, the Son always accords the Spirit a co-ordinate position and equality of authority in all the affairs of the realm. In all his work of love and life bestowal the Creator Son is always and ever perfectly sustained and ably assisted by the all-wise and ever-faithful Universe Spirit and by all of her diversified retinue of angelic personalities. Such a Divine Minister is in reality the mother of spirits and spirit personalities, the ever-present and all-wise adviser of the Creator Son, a faithful and true manifestation of the Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_4">33:3.4</a></small></sup>  The Son functions as a father in his local universe. The Spirit, as mortal creatures would understand, enacts the role of a mother, always assisting the Son and being everlastingly indispensable to the administration of the universe. In the face of insurrection only the Son and his associated Sons can function as <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverers</a>. Never can the Spirit undertake to contest <a href="/en/topic/rebellion_(spiritual)">rebellion</a> or defend authority, but ever does the Spirit sustain the Son in all of everything he may be required to experience in his efforts to stabilize government and uphold authority on worlds tainted with evil or dominated by sin. Only a Son can retrieve the work of their joint creation, but no Son could hope for final success without the incessant co-operation of the Divine Minister and her vast assemblage of spirit helpers, the <a href="/en/topic/daughters_of_God">daughters of God</a>, who so faithfully and valiantly struggle for the welfare of mortal men and the glory of their divine parents.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_5">33:3.5</a></small></sup>  Upon the completion of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>‚Äôs seventh and final creature bestowal, the uncertainties of periodic isolation terminate for the Divine Minister, and the Son‚Äôs universe helper becomes forever settled in surety and control. It is at the enthronement of the Creator Son as a <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Son, at the <a href="/en/topic/jubilee_of_jubilees">jubilee of jubilees</a>, that the Universe Spirit, before the assembled hosts, first makes public and universal acknowledgment of subordination to the Son, pledging fidelity and obedience.

Never before this momentous occasion did the Universe Spirit acknowledge subordination to the Universe Son, and not until after this voluntary relinquishment of power and authority by the Spirit could it be truthfully proclaimed of the Son that ‚Äúall power in heaven and on earth has been committed to his hand<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_6">33:3.6</a></small></sup>  After this pledge of subordination by the Creative Mother Spirit, Michael of Nebadon nobly acknowledged his eternal dependence on his Spirit companion, constituting the Spirit coruler of his universe domains and requiring all their creatures to pledge themselves in loyalty to the Spirit as they had to the Son; and there issued and went forth the final ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/Proclamation_of_Equality">Proclamation of Equality</a>.‚Äù Though he was the sovereign of this local universe, the Son published to the worlds the fact of the Spirit‚Äôs equality with him in all endowments of personality and attributes of divine character.

Going back to the early days of the local universe, before the union of the Creator Son and the Mother Spirit in the bonds of creative association, back to the times before the beginning of the creation of their versatile family of sons and daughters, the first conjoint act of this early and free association of these two divine persons results in the creation of the highest spirit personality of the Son and the Spirit, the Bright and Morning Star.</p>

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p5_2">33:5.2</a></small></sup>  Immanuel of Salvington, number 611,121 of the sixth order of <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Trinity_Personalities">Supreme Trinity Personalities</a>, is a being of sublime dignity and of such superb condescension that he refuses the worship and adoration of all living creatures. He bears the distinction of being the only personality in all Nebadon who has never acknowledged subordination to his brother <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>. He functions as <a href="/en/topic/advice">adviser</a> to the Sovereign Son but gives <a href="/en/topic/counsel">counsel</a> only on request. In the absence of the Creator Son he might preside over any high universe council but would not otherwise participate in the executive affairs of the universe except as requested.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p5_3">33:5.3</a></small></sup>  This ambassador of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is not subject to the jurisdiction of the local universe government. Neither does he exercise authoritative jurisdiction in the executive affairs of an evolving local universe except in the supervision of his liaison brethren, the <a href="/en/topic/Faithfuls_of_Days">Faithfuls of Days</a>, serving on the headquarters of the constellations.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p5_4">33:5.4</a></small></sup>  The Faithfuls of Days, like the Union of Days, never proffer advice or offer assistance to the constellation rulers unless it is asked for. These Paradise ambassadors to the constellations represent the final personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Stationary_Sons_of_the_Trinity">Stationary Sons of the Trinity</a> functioning in advisory roles in the <a href="/en/topic/local_universes">local universes</a>. Constellations are more closely related to the superuniverse administration than local systems, which are administered exclusively by personalities native to the local universe.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 6. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_1">33:6.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> is the chief executive and actual administrator of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>‚Äôs absence from <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> in no way interferes with the orderly conduct of universe affairs. During the absence of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>, as recently on the mission of reunion of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a> <a href="/en/topic/Master_Sons">Master Sons</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, Gabriel is the regent of the universe. At such times Gabriel always seeks the counsel of <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a> of Salvington regarding all major problems.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_2">33:6.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a> is Gabriel‚Äôs first assistant. When the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a> is absent from Salvington, his responsibilities are assumed by this original <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> Son.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_3">33:6.3</a></small></sup>  The various subadministrations of the universe have assigned to them certain special domains of responsibility. While, in general, a system <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> looks after the welfare of its planets, it is more particularly concerned with the physical status of living beings, with biologic problems. In turn, the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a> rulers pay especial attention to the social and governmental conditions prevailing on the different planets and systems. A constellation government is chiefly exercised over unification and stabilization. Still higher up, the universe rulers are more occupied with the spiritual status of the realms.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_4">33:6.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/ambassadors">Ambassadors</a> are appointed by judicial decree and represent universes to other universes. <a href="/en/topic/consuls_(universe)">Consuls</a> are representatives of constellations to one another and to the universe headquarters; they are appointed by legislative decree and function only within the confines of the local universe. Observers are commissioned by executive decree of a System Sovereign to represent that system to other systems and at the constellation capital, and they, too, function only within the confines of the local universe.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_5">33:6.5</a></small></sup>  From <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> are simultaneously directed to the constellation headquarters, the system headquarters, and to individual planets. All higher orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> are able to utilize this service for communication with their fellows scattered throughout the universe. The universe broadcast is extended to all inhabited worlds regardless of their spiritual status. Planetary intercommunication is denied only those worlds under spiritual <a href="/en/topic/quarantine">quarantine</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_6">33:6.6</a></small></sup>  Constellation broadcasts are periodically sent out from the headquarters of the constellation by the chief of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_7">33:6.7</a></small></sup>  Chronology is reckoned, computed, and rectified by a special group of beings on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>. The standard day of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is equal to eighteen days and six hours of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a>, plus two and one-half minutes. The Nebadon year consists of a segment of the time of universe swing in relation to the <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> circuit and is equal to one hundred days of standard universe time, about five years of Urantia time.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_8">33:6.8</a></small></sup>  Nebadon time, broadcast from Salvington, is the standard for all <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellations</a> and systems in this local universe. Each constellation conducts its affairs by Nebadon time, but the systems maintain their own chronology, as do the individual planets.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_9">33:6.9</a></small></sup>  The day in <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, as reckoned on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, is a little less (1 hour, 4 minutes, 15 seconds) than three days of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a>. These times are generally known as <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> or universe time, and Satania or system time. Standard time is universe time.</p>
<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 7. THE COURTS OF NEBADON </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_1">33:7.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Son, <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, is supremely concerned with but three things: creation, sustenance, and ministry. He does not personally participate in the judicial work of the universe. Creators never sit in <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> on their creatures; that is the exclusive function of creatures of high training and actual creature experience.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_2">33:7.2</a></small></sup>  The entire judicial mechanism of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is under the supervision of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>. The high courts, located on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, are occupied with problems of general universe import and with the appellate cases coming up from the system tribunals. There are seventy branches of these universe courts, and they function in seven divisions of ten sections each. In all matters of adjudication there presides a dual magistracy consisting of one judge of perfection antecedents and one <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">magistrate</a> of ascendant experience.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_3">33:7.3</a></small></sup>  As regards jurisdiction, the local universe courts are limited in the following matters:</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_4">33:7.4</a></small></sup>  1. The administration of the local universe is concerned with creation, evolution, maintenance, and ministry. The universe tribunals are, therefore, denied the right to pass upon those cases involving the question of eternal life and death. This has no reference to natural death as it obtains on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, but if the question of the right of continued existence, life eternal, comes up for adjudication, it must be referred to the tribunals of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>, and if decided adversely to the individual, all sentences of <a href="/en/topic/extinction">extinction</a> are carried out upon the orders, and through the agencies, of the rulers of the supergovernment.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_5">33:7.5</a></small></sup>  2. The default or defection of any of the Local <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Sons">Universe Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> which jeopardizes their status and authority as Sons is never adjudicated in the tribunals of a Son; such a misunderstanding would be immediately carried to the superuniverse courts.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_6">33:7.6</a></small></sup>  3. The question of the readmission of any constituent part of a local universe‚Äîsuch as a local system‚Äîto the fellowship of full spiritual status in the local creation subsequent to spiritual isolation must be concurred in by the high assembly of the superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_7">33:7.7</a></small></sup>  In all other matters the courts of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> are final and supreme. There is no appeal and no escape from their decisions and decrees.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_8">33:7.8</a></small></sup>  However unfairly human contentions may sometimes appear to be adjudicated on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, in the universe justice and divine equity do prevail. You are living in a well-ordered universe, and sooner or later you may depend upon being dealt with justly, even mercifully.</p>
<h2 id="p8" class="toc-header"><a href="#p8" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 8. THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS </h2>
<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_1">33:8.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, the headquarters of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, there are no true legislative bodies. The universe headquarters worlds are concerned largely with adjudication. The legislative assemblies of the local universe are located on the headquarters of the one hundred <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellations</a>. The systems are chiefly concerned with the executive and administrative work of the local creations. The <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a> and their associates enforce the legislative mandates of the constellation rulers and execute the judicial decrees of the high courts of the universe.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_2">33:8.2</a></small></sup>  While true legislation is not enacted at the universe headquarters, there do function on Salvington a variety of advisory and research assemblies, variously constituted and conducted in accordance with their scope and purpose. Some are permanent; others disband upon the accomplishment of their objective.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_3">33:8.3</a></small></sup>  <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Lanonandek_councils">supreme council</a></i> of the local universe is made up of three members from each system and seven representatives from each constellation. Systems in isolation do not have representation in this assembly, but they are permitted to send observers who attend and study all its deliberations.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_4">33:8.4</a></small></sup>  <i>The <a href="/en/topic/one_hundred_councils_of_supreme_sanction">one hundred councils of supreme sanction</a></i> are also situated on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>. The presidents of these councils constitute the immediate working cabinet of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_5">33:8.5</a></small></sup>  All findings of the high universe advisory councils are referred either to the Salvington judicial bodies or to the legislative assemblies of the constellations. These high councils are without authority or power to enforce their recommendations. If their advice is founded on the fundamental laws of the universe, then will the <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> courts issue rulings of execution; but if their recommendations have to do with local or emergency conditions, they must pass down to the legislative assemblies of the constellation for deliberative enactment and then to the system authorities for execution. These high councils are, in reality, the universe superlegislatures, but they function without the authority of enactment and without the power of execution.</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p8_6">33:8.6</a></small></sup>  While we speak of universe administration in terms of ‚Äúcourts‚Äù and ‚Äúassemblies,‚Äù it should be understood that these spiritual transactions are very different from the more primitive and material activities of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> which bear corresponding names.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup></p>
