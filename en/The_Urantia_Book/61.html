<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p0_1">61:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE era of <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a> extends from the times of the origin of placental mammals to the end of the ice age, covering a little less than fifty million years.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p0_2">61:0.2</a></small></sup>  During this <a href="/en/topic/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> age the world’s landscape presented an attractive appearance—rolling hills, broad valleys, wide rivers, and great forests. Twice during this sector of time the Panama isthmus went up and down; three times the <a href="/en/topic/Bering_Strait_land_bridge">Bering Strait land bridge</a> did the same. The animal types were both many and varied. The trees swarmed with birds, and the whole world was an animal paradise, notwithstanding the incessant struggle of the evolving animal species for supremacy.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p0_3">61:0.3</a></small></sup>  The accumulated deposits of the five periods of this fifty-million-year era contain the fossil records of the successive mammalian dynasties and lead right up through the times of the actual appearance of man himself.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE NEW CONTINENTAL LAND STAGE </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_1">61:1.1</a></small></sup>  <i>50,000,000</i> years ago the land areas of the world were very generally above water or only slightly submerged. The formations and deposits of this period are both land and marine, but chiefly land. For a considerable time the land gradually rose but was simultaneously washed down to the lower levels and toward the seas.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_2">61:1.2</a></small></sup>  Early in this period and in <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> the placental type of <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a> <i>suddenly</i> appeared, and they constituted the most important evolutionary development up to this time. Previous orders of nonplacental mammals had existed, but this new type sprang directly and <i>suddenly</i> from the pre-existent reptilian ancestor whose descendants had persisted on down through the times of dinosaur decline. The father of the placental mammals was a small, highly active, carnivorous, springing type of dinosaur.</p>

<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_3">61:1.3</a></small></sup>  Basic mammalian instincts began to be manifested in these primitive mammalian types. Mammals possess an immense survival advantage over all other forms of animal life in that they can:</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_4">61:1.4</a></small></sup>  1. Bring forth relatively mature and well-developed offspring.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_5">61:1.5</a></small></sup>  2. Nourish, nurture, and protect their offspring with affectionate regard.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_6">61:1.6</a></small></sup>  3. Employ their superior brain power in self-perpetuation.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_7">61:1.7</a></small></sup>  4. Utilize increased agility in escaping from enemies.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_8">61:1.8</a></small></sup>  5. Apply superior intelligence to environmental adjustment and adaptation.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_9">61:1.9</a></small></sup>  <i>45,000,000</i> years ago the continental backbones were elevated in association with a very general sinking of the coast lines. Mammalian life was evolving rapidly. A small reptilian, egg-laying type of mammal flourished, and the ancestors of the later <a href="/en/topic/kangaroos">kangaroos</a> roamed <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a>. Soon there were small <a href="/en/topic/horses">horses</a>, fleet-footed <a href="/en/topic/rhinoceroses">rhinoceroses</a>, <a href="/en/topic/tapirs">tapirs</a> with proboscises, primitive pigs, <a href="/en/topic/squirrels">squirrels</a>, lemurs, <a href="/en/topic/opossums">opossums</a>, and several tribes of monkeylike animals. They were all small, primitive, and best suited to living among the forests of the mountain regions. A large ostrichlike land bird developed to a height of ten feet and laid an egg nine by thirteen inches. These were the ancestors of the later gigantic <a href="/en/topic/passenger_birds">passenger birds</a> that were so highly intelligent, and that onetime transported human beings through the air.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_10">61:1.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a> of the early <a href="/en/topic/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> lived on land, under the water, in the air, and among the treetops. They had from one to eleven pairs of mammary glands, and all were covered with considerable <a href="/en/topic/hair">hair</a>. In common with the later appearing orders, they developed two successive sets of <a href="/en/topic/teeth">teeth</a> and possessed large <a href="/en/topic/brains">brains</a> in comparison to body size. But among them all no modern forms existed.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_11">61:1.11</a></small></sup>  <i>40,000,000</i> years ago the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere began to elevate, and this was followed by new extensive land deposits and other terrestrial activities, including lava flows, warping, lake formation, and erosion.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_12">61:1.12</a></small></sup>  During the latter part of this epoch most of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> was submerged. Following a slight land rise the continent was covered by lakes and bays. The <a href="/en/topic/Arctic_Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>, through the Ural depression, ran south to connect with the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> as it was then expanded northward, the highlands of the <a href="/en/topic/Alps">Alps</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Carpathians">Carpathians</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Apennines">Apennines</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> being up above the water as islands of the sea. The Isthmus of Panama was up; the <a href="/en/topic/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</a> and Pacific Oceans were separated. <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> was connected with <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> by the <a href="/en/topic/Bering_Strait_land_bridge">Bering Strait land bridge</a> and with Europe by way of <a href="/en/topic/Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Iceland">Iceland</a>. The earth circuit of land in northern latitudes was broken only by the <a href="/en/topic/Ural_Straits">Ural Straits</a>, which connected the arctic seas with the enlarged <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_13">61:1.13</a></small></sup>  Considerable foraminiferal <a href="/en/topic/limestone">limestone</a> was deposited in European waters. Today this same stone is elevated to a height of 10,000 feet in the Alps, 16,000 feet in the <a href="/en/topic/Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and 20,000 feet in <a href="/en/topic/Tibet">Tibet</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/chalk">chalk</a> deposits of this period are found along the coasts of <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a>, on the west coast of <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>, and about the <a href="/en/topic/West_Indies">West Indies</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_14">61:1.14</a></small></sup>  Throughout this so-called <i><a href="/en/topic/Eocene">Eocene</a></i> period the evolution of mammalian and other related forms of life continued with little or no interruption. <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> was then connected by land with every continent except Australia, and the world was gradually overrun by primitive mammalian fauna of various types.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE RECENT FLOOD STAGE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_1">61:2.1</a></small></sup>  This period was characterized by the further and rapid evolution of placental <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a>, the more progressive forms of mammalian life developing during these times.</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_2">61:2.2</a></small></sup>  Although the early placental mammals sprang from carnivorous ancestors, very soon herbivorous branches developed, and, erelong, omnivorous mammalian families also sprang up. The <a href="/en/topic/angiosperms">angiosperms</a> were the principal food of the rapidly increasing mammals, the modern land flora, including the majority of present-day plants and trees, having appeared during earlier periods.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_3">61:2.3</a></small></sup>  <i>35,000,000</i> years ago marks the beginning of the age of placental-mammalian world domination. The southern <a href="/en/topic/English_Channel_land_bridge">land bridge</a> was extensive, reconnecting the then enormous Antarctic continent with <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>, <a href="/en/topic/South_Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a>. In spite of the massing of land in high latitudes, the world climate remained relatively mild because of the enormous increase in the size of the tropic seas, nor was the land elevated sufficiently to produce <a href="/en/topic/glaciers">glaciers</a>. Extensive lava flows occurred in <a href="/en/topic/Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Iceland">Iceland</a>, some <a href="/en/topic/coal">coal</a> being deposited between these layers.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_4">61:2.4</a></small></sup>  Marked changes were taking place in the fauna of the planet. The sea life was undergoing great modification; most of the present-day orders of marine life were in existence, and <a href="/en/topic/foraminifers">foraminifers</a> continued to play an important role. The insect life was much like that of the previous era. The <a href="/en/topic/Florissant_fossil_beds">Florissant fossil beds</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Colorado">Colorado</a> belong to the later years of these far-distant times. Most of the living insect families go back to this period, but many then in existence are now extinct, though their <a href="/en/topic/fossils">fossils</a> remain.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_5">61:2.5</a></small></sup>  On land this was pre-eminently the age of mammalian renovation and expansion. Of the earlier and more primitive <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a>, over one hundred species were extinct before this period ended. Even the mammals of large size and small <a href="/en/topic/brains">brain</a> soon perished. Brains and agility had replaced armor and size in the progress of animal survival. And with the dinosaur family on the decline, the mammals slowly assumed domination of the earth, speedily and completely destroying the remainder of their reptilian ancestors.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_6">61:2.6</a></small></sup>  Along with the disappearance of the <a href="/en/topic/dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>, other and great changes occurred in the various branches of the saurian family. The surviving members of the early reptilian families are <a href="/en/topic/turtles">turtles</a>, <a href="/en/topic/snakes">snakes</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/crocodiles">crocodiles</a>, together with the venerable <a href="/en/topic/frogs">frog</a>, the only remaining group representative of man’s earlier ancestors.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_7">61:2.7</a></small></sup>  Various groups of <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a> had their origin in a unique animal now extinct. This carnivorous creature was something of a cross between a cat and a seal; it could live on land or in water and was highly intelligent and very active. In <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> the ancestor of the canine family evolved, soon giving rise to many species of small <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dogs</a>. About the same time the gnawing <a href="/en/topic/rodents">rodents</a>, including <a href="/en/topic/beavers">beavers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/squirrels">squirrels</a>, <a href="/en/topic/gophers">gophers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/mice">mice</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/rabbits">rabbits</a>, appeared and soon became a notable form of life, very little change having since occurred in this family. The later deposits of this period contain the fossil remains of dogs, <a href="/en/topic/cats">cats</a>, coons, and <a href="/en/topic/weasels">weasels</a> in ancestral form.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_8">61:2.8</a></small></sup>  <i>30,000,000</i> years ago the modern types of mammals began to make their appearance. Formerly the mammals had lived for the greater part in the hills, being of the mountainous types; <i>suddenly</i> there began the <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> of the plains or hoofed type, the grazing species, as differentiated from the clawed flesh eaters. These grazers sprang from an undifferentiated ancestor having five toes and forty-four teeth, which perished before the end of the age. Toe evolution did not progress beyond the three-toed stage throughout this period.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_9">61:2.9</a></small></sup>  The horse, an outstanding example of evolution, lived during these times in both <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, though his development was not fully completed until the later ice age. While the rhinoceros family appeared at the close of this period, it underwent its greatest expansion subsequently. A small hoglike creature also developed which became the ancestor of the many species of <a href="/en/topic/swine">swine</a>, <a href="/en/topic/peccaries">peccaries</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/hippopotamuses">hippopotamuses</a>. Camels and <a href="/en/topic/llamas">llamas</a> had their origin in North America about the middle of this period and overran the western plains. Later, the llamas migrated to <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/camels">camels</a> to Europe, and soon both were extinct in North America, though a few camels survived up to the ice age.</p>

<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_10">61:2.10</a></small></sup>  About this time a notable thing occurred in western North America: The early ancestors of the ancient <a href="/en/topic/lemurs">lemurs</a> first made their appearance. While this family cannot be regarded as true lemurs, their coming marked the establishment of the line from which the true lemurs subsequently sprang.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_11">61:2.11</a></small></sup>  Like the land serpents of a previous age which betook themselves to the seas, now a whole tribe of placental <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a> deserted the land and took up their residence in the oceans. And they have ever since remained in the sea, yielding the modern <a href="/en/topic/whales">whales</a>, <a href="/en/topic/dolphins">dolphins</a>, <a href="/en/topic/porpoises">porpoises</a>, <a href="/en/topic/seals">seals</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/sea_lions">sea lions</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_12">61:2.12</a></small></sup>  The bird life of the planet continued to develop, but with few important evolutionary changes. The majority of modern birds were existent, including <a href="/en/topic/gulls">gulls</a>, <a href="/en/topic/herons">herons</a>, <a href="/en/topic/flamingoes">flamingoes</a>, <a href="/en/topic/buzzards">buzzards</a>, <a href="/en/topic/falcons">falcons</a>, <a href="/en/topic/eagles">eagles</a>, <a href="/en/topic/owls">owls</a>, quails, and <a href="/en/topic/ostriches">ostriches</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_13">61:2.13</a></small></sup>  By the close of this <i><a href="/en/topic/Oligocene">Oligocene</a></i> period, covering ten million years, the plant life, together with the marine life and the land animals, had very largely evolved and was present on earth much as today. Considerable specialization has subsequently appeared, but the ancestral forms of most living things were then alive.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE MODERN MOUNTAIN STAGE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_1">61:3.1</a></small></sup>  Land elevation and sea segregation were slowly changing the world’s weather, gradually cooling it, but the climate was still mild. Sequoias and <a href="/en/topic/magnolias">magnolias</a> grew in <a href="/en/topic/Greenland">Greenland</a>, but the subtropical plants were beginning to migrate southward. By the end of this period these warm-climate plants and trees had largely disappeared from the northern latitudes, their places being taken by more hardy plants and the deciduous trees.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_2">61:3.2</a></small></sup>  There was a great increase in the varieties of grasses, and the teeth of many mammalian species gradually altered to conform to the present-day grazing type.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_3">61:3.3</a></small></sup>  <i>25,000,000</i> years ago there was a slight land submergence following the long epoch of land elevation. The Rocky Mountain region remained highly elevated so that the deposition of erosion material continued throughout the lowlands to the east. The <a href="/en/topic/Sierras">Sierras</a> were well re-elevated; in fact, they have been rising ever since. The great four-mile vertical fault in the <a href="/en/topic/California">California</a> region dates from this time.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_4">61:3.4</a></small></sup>  <i>20,000,000</i> years ago was indeed the golden age of <a href="/en/topic/mammals">mammals</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Bering_Strait_land_bridge">Bering Strait land bridge</a> was up, and many groups of animals migrated to <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> from <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, including the four-tusked <a href="/en/topic/mastodons">mastodons</a>, short-legged <a href="/en/topic/rhinoceroses">rhinoceroses</a>, and many varieties of the cat family.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_5">61:3.5</a></small></sup>  The first <a href="/en/topic/deer">deer</a> appeared, and North America was soon overrun by <a href="/en/topic/ruminants">ruminants</a>—deer, <a href="/en/topic/oxen">oxen</a>, <a href="/en/topic/camels">camels</a>, <a href="/en/topic/bison">bison</a>, and several species of rhinoceroses—but the giant pigs, more than six feet tall, became extinct.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_6">61:3.6</a></small></sup>  The huge <a href="/en/topic/elephants">elephants</a> of this and subsequent periods possessed large brains as well as large bodies, and they soon overran the entire world except <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a>. For once the world was dominated by a huge animal with a brain sufficiently large to enable it to carry on. Confronted by the highly intelligent life of these ages, no animal the size of an elephant could have survived unless it had possessed a brain of large size and superior quality. In intelligence and adaptation the elephant is approached only by the horse and is surpassed only by man himself. Even so, of the fifty species of elephants in existence at the opening of this period, only two have survived.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_7">61:3.7</a></small></sup>  <i>15,000,000</i> years ago the mountain regions of Eurasia were rising, and there was some volcanic activity throughout these regions, but nothing comparable to the lava flows of the Western Hemisphere. These unsettled conditions prevailed all over the world.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_8">61:3.8</a></small></sup>  The Strait of Gibraltar closed, and <a href="/en/topic/Spain">Spain</a> was connected with <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> by the old <a href="/en/topic/English_Channel_land_bridge">land bridge</a>, but the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> flowed into the <a href="/en/topic/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</a> through a narrow channel which extended across <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a>, the mountain peaks and highlands appearing as islands above this ancient sea. Later on, these <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> seas began to withdraw. Still later, the Mediterranean was connected with the <a href="/en/topic/Indian_Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, while at the close of this period the <a href="/en/topic/Suez_region">Suez region</a> was elevated so that the Mediterranean became, for a time, an inland salt sea.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_9">61:3.9</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Iceland">Iceland</a> land bridge submerged, and the arctic waters commingled with those of the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic coast of <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> rapidly cooled, but the Pacific coast remained warmer than at present. The great ocean currents were in function and affected climate much as they do today.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_10">61:3.10</a></small></sup>  Mammalian life continued to evolve. Enormous herds of <a href="/en/topic/horses">horses</a> joined the <a href="/en/topic/camels">camels</a> on the western plains of North America; this was truly the age of horses as well as of <a href="/en/topic/elephants">elephants</a>. The horse’s brain is next in animal quality to that of the elephant, but in one respect it is decidedly inferior, for the horse never fully overcame the deep-seated propensity to flee when frightened. The horse lacks the emotional control of the elephant, while the elephant is greatly handicapped by size and lack of agility.

The land was greatly altered in topography. Mountain ranges were born, streams changed their courses, and isolated <a href="/en/topic/volcanoes">volcanoes</a> broke out all over the world.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_2">61:4.2</a></small></sup>  <i>10,000,000</i> years ago began an age of widespread local land deposits on the lowlands of the continents, but most of these sedimentations were later removed. Much of Europe, at this time, was still under water, including parts of <a href="/en/topic/England">England</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Belgium">Belgium</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> covered much of northern <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>.

<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_6">61:4.6</a></small></sup>  The climate was gradually getting cooler; the land plants were slowly moving southward.

<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. THE EARLY ICE AGE </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_1">61:5.1</a></small></sup>  By the close of the preceding period the lands of the northeastern part of <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> and of northern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> were highly elevated on an extensive scale, in North America vast areas rising up to 30,000 feet and more. Mild climates had formerly prevailed over these northern regions, and the arctic waters were all open to evaporation, and they continued to be ice-free until almost the close of the glacial period.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_2">61:5.2</a></small></sup>  Simultaneously with these land elevations the ocean currents shifted, and the seasonal winds changed their direction. These conditions eventually produced an almost constant precipitation of moisture from the movement of the heavily saturated atmosphere over the northern highlands. Snow began to fall on these elevated and therefore cool regions, and it continued to fall until it had attained a depth of 20,000 feet. The areas of the greatest depth of <a href="/en/topic/snow">snow</a>, together with altitude, determined the central points of subsequent glacial pressure flows. And the ice age persisted just as long as this excessive precipitation continued to cover these northern highlands with this enormous mantle of snow, which soon metamorphosed into solid but creeping ice.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_3">61:5.3</a></small></sup>  The great ice sheets of this period were all located on elevated highlands, not in mountainous regions where they are found today. One half of the glacial ice was in <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a>, one fourth in Eurasia, and one fourth elsewhere, chiefly in <a href="/en/topic/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> was little affected by the ice, but <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a> was almost covered with the antarctic ice blanket.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_4">61:5.4</a></small></sup>  The northern regions of this world have experienced six separate and distinct ice invasions, although there were scores of advances and recessions associated with the activity of each individual ice sheet. The ice in North America collected in two and, later, three centers. <a href="/en/topic/Greenland">Greenland</a> was covered, and <a href="/en/topic/Iceland">Iceland</a> was completely buried beneath the ice flow. In <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> the ice at various times covered the <a href="/en/topic/British_Isles">British Isles</a> excepting the coast of southern <a href="/en/topic/England">England</a>, and it overspread western Europe down to <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_5">61:5.5</a></small></sup>  <i>2,000,000</i> years ago <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> North American glacier started its southern advance. The ice age was now in the making, and this glacier consumed nearly one million years in its advance from, and retreat back toward, the northern pressure centers. The central ice sheet extended south as far as <a href="/en/topic/Kansas">Kansas</a>; the eastern and western ice centers were not then so extensive.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_6">61:5.6</a></small></sup>  <i>1,500,000</i> years ago the first great glacier was retreating northward. In the meantime, enormous quantities of snow had been falling on <a href="/en/topic/Greenland">Greenland</a> and on the northeastern part of North America, and erelong this eastern ice mass began to flow southward. This was the second invasion of the ice.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_7">61:5.7</a></small></sup>  These first two ice invasions were not extensive in Eurasia.

But from this time forward they were rapidly reduced in numbers by the increasing cold of the glacial period. Toward the close of the ice age the majority of these animal species were extinct in North America.</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p5_8">61:5.8</a></small></sup>  Away from the <a href="/en/topic/ice">ice</a> the land and water life of the world was little changed. Between the ice invasions the climate was about as mild as at present, perhaps a little warmer. The glaciers were, after all, local phenomena, though they spread out to cover enormous areas. The coastwise climate varied greatly between the times of glacial inaction and those times when enormous icebergs were sliding off the coast of <a href="/en/topic/Maine">Maine</a> into the <a href="/en/topic/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</a>, slipping out through <a href="/en/topic/Puget_Sound">Puget Sound</a> into the Pacific, and thundering down Norwegian fiords into the <a href="/en/topic/North_Sea">North Sea</a>.</p>

<p id="p7_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_16">61:7.16</a></small></sup>  The enforced migration of life before the advancing ice led to an extraordinary commingling of plants and of animals, and with the retreat of the final ice invasion, many arctic species of both plants and animals were left stranded high upon certain mountain peaks, whither they had journeyed to escape destruction by the glacier. And so, today, these dislocated plants and animals may be found high up on the <a href="/en/topic/Alps">Alps</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> and even on the <a href="/en/topic/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> of <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a>.</p>
