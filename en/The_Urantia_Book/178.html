<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p0_1">178:0.1</a></small></sup>  JESUS planned to spend this <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a>, his last free day on earth as a divine Son incarnated in the flesh, with his apostles and a few loyal and devoted disciples. Soon after the breakfast hour on this beautiful morning, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> led them to a secluded spot a short distance above their camp and there taught them many new truths. Although <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> delivered other discourses to the apostles during the early evening hours of the day, this talk of Thursday forenoon was his farewell address to the combined camp group of apostles and chosen disciples, both <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and gentiles. The twelve were all present save Judas. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and several of the apostles remarked about his absence, and some of them thought Jesus had sent him into the city to attend to some matter, probably to arrange the details of their forthcoming celebration of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. Judas did not return to the camp until midafternoon, a short time before Jesus led the twelve into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to partake of the <a href="/en/topic/Last_Supper">Last Supper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. DISCOURSE ON SONSHIP AND CITIZENSHIP </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_1">178:1.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> talked to about fifty of his trusted followers for almost two hours and answered a score of questions regarding the relation of the kingdom of heaven to the kingdoms of this world, concerning the relation of <a href="/en/topic/sonship_with_God">sonship with God</a> to citizenship in earthly governments. This discourse, together with his answers to questions, may be summarized and restated in modern <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> as follows:</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_2">178:1.2</a></small></sup>  The kingdoms of this world, being material, may often find it necessary to employ physical force in the execution of their laws and for the maintenance of <a href="/en/topic/order">order</a>. In the kingdom of heaven true <a href="/en/topic/believers">believers</a> will not resort to the employment of physical force. The kingdom of heaven, being a spiritual brotherhood of the spirit-born sons of God, may be promulgated only by the power of the spirit. This distinction of procedure refers to the relations of the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/religionists">believers</a> to the kingdoms of secular <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> and does not nullify the right of social groups of believers to maintain order in their ranks and administer <a href="/en/topic/discipline">discipline</a> upon unruly and unworthy members.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_3">178:1.3</a></small></sup>  There is nothing incompatible between sonship in the spiritual kingdom and citizenship in the secular or civil government. It is the believer’s duty to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> the things which are God’s<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. There cannot be any disagreement between these two requirements, the one being material and the other spiritual, unless it should develop that a Caesar presumes to usurp the prerogatives of God and demand that spiritual homage and supreme worship be rendered to him. In such a case you shall worship only God while you seek to enlighten such misguided earthly rulers and in this way lead them also to the recognition of the Father in heaven. You shall not render spiritual worship to earthly rulers; neither should you employ the physical forces of earthly governments, whose rulers may sometime become believers, in the work of furthering the mission of the spiritual kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_4">178:1.4</a></small></sup>  Sonship in the kingdom, from the standpoint of advancing civilization, should assist you in becoming the ideal citizens of the kingdoms of this world since brotherhood and <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> are the cornerstones of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom. The love call of the spiritual kingdom should prove to be the effective destroyer of the hate urge of the unbelieving and war-minded citizens of the earthly kingdoms. But these material-minded sons in darkness will never know of your spiritual light of truth unless you draw very near them with that unselfish social service which is the natural outgrowth of the bearing of the fruits of the spirit in the life experience of each individual believer.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_5">178:1.5</a></small></sup>  As mortal and material men, you are indeed citizens of the earthly kingdoms, and you should be good citizens, all the better for having become reborn spirit sons of the heavenly kingdom. As faith-enlightened and spirit-liberated sons of the kingdom of heaven, you face a double responsibility of <a href="/en/topic/duty">duty</a> to man and duty to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> while you voluntarily assume a third and sacred obligation: service to the brotherhood of God-knowing <a href="/en/topic/believers">believers</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_6">178:1.6</a></small></sup>  You may not worship your temporal rulers, and you should not employ temporal power in the furtherance of the spiritual kingdom; but you should manifest the righteous ministry of loving <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> to believers and unbelievers alike. In the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom there resides the mighty <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a>, and presently I will pour out this same spirit upon all flesh. The fruits of the spirit, your sincere and loving service, are the mighty social lever to uplift the races of darkness, and this Spirit of Truth will become your power-multiplying fulcrum.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_7">178:1.7</a></small></sup>  Display wisdom and exhibit sagacity in your dealings with unbelieving civil rulers. By discretion show yourselves to be expert in ironing out minor disagreements and in adjusting trifling <a href="/en/topic/misunderstandings">misunderstandings</a>. In every possible way—in everything short of your spiritual allegiance to the rulers of the universe—seek to live peaceably with all men. Be you always as wise as serpents but as harmless as <a href="/en/topic/doves">doves</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_8">178:1.8</a></small></sup>  You should be made all the better citizens of the secular <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> as a result of becoming enlightened sons of the kingdom; so should the rulers of earthly governments become all the better rulers in civil affairs as a result of believing this <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the heavenly kingdom. The attitude of unselfish service of man and intelligent worship of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> should make all kingdom believers better world citizens, while the attitude of honest citizenship and sincere devotion to one’s temporal <a href="/en/topic/duty">duty</a> should help to make such a citizen the more easily reached by the spirit call to sonship in the heavenly kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_9">178:1.9</a></small></sup>  So long as the rulers of earthly governments seek to exercise the authority of religious <a href="/en/topic/dictators">dictators</a>, you who believe this gospel can expect only trouble, persecution, and even death. But the very light which you bear to the world, and even the very manner in which you will suffer and die for this gospel of the kingdom, will, in themselves, eventually enlighten the whole world and result in the gradual divorcement of politics and <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>. The persistent preaching of this gospel of the kingdom will some day bring to all nations a new and unbelievable liberation, intellectual freedom, and religious liberty.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_10">178:1.10</a></small></sup>  Under the soon-coming persecutions by those who hate this <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of joy and liberty, you will thrive and the kingdom will prosper. But you will stand in grave danger in subsequent times when most men will speak well of kingdom <a href="/en/topic/believers">believers</a> and many in high places nominally accept the gospel of the heavenly kingdom. Learn to be faithful to the kingdom even in times of peace and prosperity. Tempt not the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of your supervision to lead you in troublous ways as a loving <a href="/en/topic/discipline">discipline</a> designed to save your ease-drifting souls.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_11">178:1.11</a></small></sup>  Remember that you are commissioned to preach this gospel of the kingdom—the supreme desire to do the Father’s will coupled with the supreme joy of the faith realization of <a href="/en/topic/sonship_with_God">sonship with God</a>—and you must not allow anything to divert your devotion to this one <a href="/en/topic/duty">duty</a>. Let all mankind benefit from the overflow of your loving spiritual ministry, enlightening intellectual communion, and uplifting social <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a>; but none of these humanitarian labors, nor all of them, should be permitted to take the place of proclaiming the gospel. These mighty ministrations are the social by-products of the still more mighty and sublime ministrations and transformations wrought in the heart of the kingdom believer by the living <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> and by the personal realization that the faith of a spirit-born man confers the assurance of living fellowship with the eternal <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_12">178:1.12</a></small></sup>  You must not seek to promulgate <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> nor to establish <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a> by the power of civil governments or by the enaction of secular laws. You may always labor to persuade men’s minds, but you must never dare to compel them. You must not forget the great <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> of human fairness which I have taught you in positive form: Whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do even so to them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_13">178:1.13</a></small></sup>  When a kingdom believer is called upon to serve the civil <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>, let him render such service as a temporal citizen of such a government, albeit such a believer should display in his civil service all of the ordinary traits of citizenship as these have been enhanced by the spiritual enlightenment of the ennobling association of the mind of mortal man with the indwelling spirit of the eternal <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. If the unbeliever can qualify as a superior civil servant, you should seriously question whether the roots of truth in your heart have not died from the lack of the living waters of combined spiritual communion and social service. The consciousness of <a href="/en/topic/sonship_with_God">sonship with God</a> should quicken the entire life service of every man, woman, and child who has become the possessor of such a mighty stimulus to all the inherent powers of a human <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a>.</p>

You are indeed to be gentle in your dealings with erring <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, patient in your intercourse with ignorant men, and forbearing under provocation; but you are also to be valiant in defense of <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a>, mighty in the promulgation of <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>, and aggressive in the preaching of this <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom, even to the ends of the earth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>

I have told you it is like the <a href="/en/topic/leaven">leaven</a> in the dough, like the grain of <a href="/en/topic/mustard_seed">mustard seed</a>; and now I declare that it is like the seed of the living being, which, from generation to generation, while it remains the same living seed, unfailingly unfolds itself in new manifestations and grows acceptably in channels of new adaptation to the peculiar needs and conditions of each successive generation<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. The revelation I have made to you is a <i>living revelation,</i> and I desire that it shall bear appropriate fruits in each individual and in each generation in accordance with the laws of spiritual growth, increase, and adaptative development.

We clashed with these established leaders and recognized rulers only when they threw themselves directly in the <a href="/en/topic/way">way</a> of the preaching of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom to the sons of men. And even now, it is not we who assail them, but they who seek our destruction. Do not forget that you are commissioned to go forth preaching only the good news.

<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. AFTER THE NOONTIME MEAL </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_1">178:2.1</a></small></sup>  Not many of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s hearers were able to take in even a part of his forenoon address. Of all who heard him, the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> comprehended most. Even the eleven apostles were bewildered by his allusions to future political kingdoms and to successive generations of kingdom believers. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ most devoted followers could not reconcile the impending end of his earthly ministry with these references to an extended future of gospel activities. Some of these Jewish believers were beginning to sense that earth’s greatest tragedy was about to take place, but they could not reconcile such an impending <a href="/en/topic/disaster">disaster</a> with either the Master’s cheerfully indifferent personal attitude or his forenoon discourse, wherein he repeatedly alluded to the future transactions of the heavenly kingdom, extending over vast stretches of time and embracing relations with many and successive temporal kingdoms on earth.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_2">178:2.2</a></small></sup>  By noon of this day all the apostles and disciples had learned about the hasty flight of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> from <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>.

He knew all about the part of Judas in this plot, but he never disclosed this knowledge to the other apostles nor to any of the disciples. Shortly after lunch he did lead Jesus aside and, making bold, asked him whether he knew—but he never got further with his question. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, holding up his hand, stopped him, saying: “Yes, <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, I know all about it, and I know that you know, but see to it that you tell no man.

This runner hastened off for Philadelphia with this word for Abner: “Go on with your work. If I depart from you in the flesh, it is only that I may return in the spirit. I will not forsake you. I will be with you to the end.”</p>

<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_8">178:2.8</a></small></sup>  When the apostles reached the city, they met the man with the water pitcher near the gate and followed on after him to the home of <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a>, where the lad’s father met them and showed them the upper room in readiness for the evening meal<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_9">178:2.9</a></small></sup>  And all of this came to pass as the result of an understanding arrived at between the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and John Mark during the afternoon of the preceding day when they were alone in the hills. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> wanted to be sure he would have this one last meal undisturbed with his apostles, and believing if Judas knew beforehand of their place of meeting he might arrange with his enemies to take him, he made this secret arrangement with John Mark. In this way Judas did not learn of their place of meeting until later on when he arrived there in company with Jesus and the other apostles.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_10">178:2.10</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> had much business to transact with Judas so that he was easily prevented from following <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, John, and <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>, as he so much desired to do. When Judas gave <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> a certain sum of <a href="/en/topic/money">money</a> for provisions, David said to him: “Judas, might it not be well, under the circumstances, to provide me with a little money in advance of my actual needs?” And after Judas had reflected for a moment, he answered: “Yes, David, I think it would be wise. In fact, in view of the disturbed conditions in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, I think it would be best for me to turn over all the money to you. They plot against the Master, and in case anything should happen to me, you would not be hampered.”</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_11">178:2.11</a></small></sup>  And so David received all the apostolic cash funds and receipts for all money on deposit. Not until the evening of the next day did the apostles learn of this transaction.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p2_12">178:2.12</a></small></sup>  It was about half past four o’clock when the three apostles returned and informed <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> that everything was in readiness for the supper. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> immediately prepared to lead his twelve apostles over the trail to the <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> road and on into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. And this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> journey he ever made with all twelve of them.</p>

As they drew near the place where Jesus had tarried the previous evening to discourse on the destruction of Jerusalem, they unconsciously paused while they stood and looked down in silence upon the city. As they were a little early, and since Jesus did not wish to pass through the city until after sunset, he said to his associates:</p>
