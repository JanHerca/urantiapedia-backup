<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p0_1">48:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE Gods cannot‚Äîat least they do not‚Äîtransform a creature of gross animal nature into a perfected spirit by some mysterious act of creative magic. When the Creators desire to produce perfect beings, they do so by direct and original creation, but they never undertake to convert animal-origin and material creatures into beings of perfection in a single step.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p0_2">48:0.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> life, extending as it does over the various stages of the local universe career, is the only possible approach whereby material <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> could attain the threshold of the spirit world. What magic could <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a>, the natural dissolution of the material body, hold that such a simple step should instantly transform the mortal and material mind into an immortal and perfected spirit? Such beliefs are but ignorant superstitions and pleasing fables.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p0_3">48:0.3</a></small></sup>  Always this morontia transition intervenes between the mortal estate and the subsequent spirit status of surviving human beings. This intermediate state of universe progress differs markedly in the various local creations, but in intent and purpose they are all quite similar. The arrangement of the mansion and higher <a href="/en/topic/morontia_worlds">morontia worlds</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is fairly typical of the morontia transition regimes in this part of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. MORONTIA MATERIALS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_1">48:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> realms are the local universe liaison spheres between the material and spiritual levels of creature existence. This morontia life has been known on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> since the early days of the Planetary Prince. From time to time this transition state has been taught to <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, and the concept, in distorted form, has found a place in present-day religions.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_2">48:1.2</a></small></sup>  The morontia spheres are the transition phases of mortal ascension through the progression worlds of the local universe. Only the seven worlds surrounding the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a>‚Äô sphere of the <a href="/en/topic/local_systems">local systems</a> are called <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a>, but all fifty-six of the system transition abodes, in common with the higher spheres around the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellations</a> and the universe headquarters, are called <a href="/en/topic/morontia_worlds">morontia worlds</a>. These creations partake of the physical beauty and the morontia grandeur of the local universe headquarters spheres.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_3">48:1.3</a></small></sup>  All of these worlds are <a href="/en/topic/architectural_spheres">architectural spheres</a>, and they have just double the number of <a href="/en/topic/elements_(natural)">elements</a> of the evolved planets. Such made-to-order worlds not only abound in the heavy metals and crystals, having one hundred physical <a href="/en/topic/elements_(chemical)">elements</a>, but likewise have exactly one hundred forms of a unique energy organization called <i><a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> material.</i> The <a href="/en/topic/Master_Physical_Controllers">Master Physical Controllers</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Power_Supervisors">Morontia Power Supervisors</a> are able so to modify the revolutions of the primary units of <a href="/en/topic/matter">matter</a> and at the same time so to transform these associations of energy as to create this new substance.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_4">48:1.4</a></small></sup>  The early morontia life in the local systems is very much like that of your present material world, becoming less physical and more truly morontial on the constellation study worlds. And as you advance to the <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> spheres, you increasingly attain spiritual levels.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_5">48:1.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Power_Supervisors">Morontia Power Supervisors</a> are able to effect a union of material and of spiritual energies, thereby organizing a <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> form of materialization which is receptive to the superimposition of a controlling spirit. When you traverse the morontia life of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, these same patient and skillful Morontia Power Supervisors will successively provide you with 570 morontia bodies, each one a phase of your progressive transformation. From the time of leaving the material worlds until you are constituted a first-stage spirit on Salvington, you will undergo just 570 separate and ascending morontia changes. Eight of these occur in the system, seventy-one in the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a>, and 491 during the sojourn on the spheres of Salvington.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_6">48:1.6</a></small></sup>  In the days of the mortal flesh the divine spirit indwells you, almost as a thing apart‚Äîin reality an invasion of man by the bestowed spirit of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. But in the morontia life the spirit will become a real part of your personality, and as you successively pass through the 570 progressive transformations, you ascend from the material to the spiritual estate of creature life.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_1">48:2.1</a></small></sup>  These unique beings are exclusively concerned with the supervision of those activities which represent a working combination of spiritual and physical or semimaterial energies. They are exclusively devoted to the ministry of <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> progression. Not that they so much minister to <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> during the transition experience, but they rather make possible the transition environment for the progressing morontia creatures. They are the channels of morontia power which sustain and energize the morontia phases of the transition worlds.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_2">48:2.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Power_Supervisors">Morontia Power Supervisors</a> are the offspring of a local universe Mother Spirit. They are fairly standard in design though differing slightly in nature in the various local creations. They are created for their specific function and require no training before entering upon their responsibilities.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_3">48:2.3</a></small></sup>  The creation of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> Morontia Power Supervisors is simultaneous with the arrival of the first mortal survivor on the shores of some one of the first mansion worlds in a local universe. They are created in groups of one thousand, classified as follows:</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_4">48:2.4</a></small></sup>  1. <a href="/en/topic/circuit_regulators">Circuit Regulators</a> . . . 400</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_5">48:2.5</a></small></sup>  2. System Co-ordinators . . 200</p>

<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_9">48:2.9</a></small></sup>  6. Selective Assorters . . . . 50</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_10">48:2.10</a></small></sup>  7. <a href="/en/topic/associate_registrars">Associate Registrars</a> . . . 50</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_11">48:2.11</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/power_supervisors">power supervisors</a> always serve in their native universe. They are directed exclusively by the joint spirit activity of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Universe Son</a> and the Universe Spirit but are otherwise a wholly self-governing group. They maintain headquarters on each of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> mansion worlds of the local systems, where they work in close association with both the physical controllers and the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> but function in a world of their own as regards energy manifestation and spirit application.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_12">48:2.12</a></small></sup>  They also sometimes work in connection with supermaterial phenomena on the evolutionary worlds as ministers of temporary assignment. But they rarely serve on the inhabited planets; neither do they work on the higher training worlds of the superuniverse, being chiefly devoted to the transition regime of <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> progression in a local universe.</p>
<p id="p2_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_13">48:2.13</a></small></sup>  1. <i><a href="/en/topic/circuit_regulators">Circuit Regulators</a>.</i> These are the unique beings who co-ordinate physical and spiritual energy and regulate its flow into the segregated channels of the morontia spheres, and these circuits are exclusively planetary, limited to a single world. The morontia circuits are distinct from, and supplementary to, both physical and spiritual circuits on the transition worlds, and it requires millions of these regulators to energize even a system of mansion worlds like that of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_14">48:2.14</a></small></sup>  Circuit regulators initiate those changes in material energies which render them subject to the control and regulation of their associates. These beings are <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> power generators as well as circuit regulators. Much as a dynamo apparently generates electricity out of the atmosphere, so do these living morontia dynamos seem to transform the everywhere energies of space into those materials which the morontia supervisors weave into the bodies and life activities of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_15">48:2.15</a></small></sup>  2. <i>System Co-ordinators.</i> Since each morontia world has a separate order of morontia energy, it is exceedingly difficult for humans to visualize these spheres. But on each successive transition sphere, mortals will find the plant life and everything else pertaining to the morontia existence progressively modified to correspond with the advancing spiritization of the ascending survivor. And since the energy system of each world is thus individualized, these co-ordinators operate to harmonize and blend such differing power systems into a working unit for the associated spheres of any particular group.</p>
<p id="p2_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_16">48:2.16</a></small></sup>  Ascending <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> gradually progress from the physical to the spiritual as they advance from one <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> world to another; hence the necessity for providing an ascending scale of morontia spheres and an ascending scale of morontia forms.</p>
<p id="p2_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_17">48:2.17</a></small></sup>  When mansion world <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> pass from one sphere to another, they are delivered by the <a href="/en/topic/transport_seraphim">transport seraphim</a> to the receivers of the <a href="/en/topic/system_co-ordinators">system co-ordinators</a> on the advanced world. Here in those unique temples at the center of the seventy radiating wings wherein are the chambers of transition similar to the <a href="/en/topic/resurrection">resurrection</a> halls on the initial world of reception for earth-origin mortals, the necessary changes in creature form are skillfully effected by the system co-ordinators. These early morontia-form changes require about seven days of standard time for their accomplishment.</p>
<p id="p2_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_18">48:2.18</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Planetary Custodians.</i> Each <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> world, from the mansion spheres up to the universe headquarters, is in the custody‚Äîas regards morontia affairs‚Äîof seventy guardians. They constitute the local planetary council of supreme morontia authority. This council grants material for morontia forms to all ascending creatures who land on the spheres and authorizes those changes in creature form which make it possible for an ascender to proceed to the succeeding sphere. After the mansion worlds have been traversed, you will translate from one phase of morontia life to another without having to surrender consciousness. Unconsciousness attends only the earlier metamorphoses and the later transitions from one universe to another and from <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_19">48:2.19</a></small></sup>  4. <i><a href="/en/topic/combined_controllers">Combined Controllers</a>.</i> One of these highly mechanical beings is always stationed at the center of each administrative unit of a morontia world. A combined controller is sensitive to, and functional with, physical, spiritual, and morontial energies; and with this being there are always associated two <a href="/en/topic/system_co-ordinators">system co-ordinators</a>, four <a href="/en/topic/circuit_regulators">circuit regulators</a>, one planetary custodian, one liaison stabilizer, and either an associate registrar or a selective assorter.</p>
<p id="p2_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_20">48:2.20</a></small></sup>  5. <i>Liaison Stabilizers.</i> These are the regulators of the <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a> in association with the physical and spirit forces of the realm. They make possible the conversion of morontia energy into morontia material. The whole morontia organization of existence is dependent on the stabilizers. They slow down the energy revolutions to that point where physicalization can occur. But I have no terms with which I can compare or illustrate the ministry of such beings. It is quite beyond human imagination.</p>
<p id="p2_21"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_21">48:2.21</a></small></sup>  6. <i>Selective Assorters.</i> As you progress from one class or phase of a morontia world to another, you must be re-keyed or advance-tuned, and it is the task of the <a href="/en/topic/selective_assorters">selective assorters</a> to keep you in progressive synchrony with the morontia life.</p>
<p id="p2_22"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_22">48:2.22</a></small></sup>  While the basic <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> forms of life and <a href="/en/topic/matter">matter</a> are identical from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> mansion world to the last universe transition sphere, there is a functional progression which gradually extends from the material to the spiritual. Your adaptation to this basically uniform but successively advancing and spiritizing creation is effected by this selective re-keying. Such an adjustment in the mechanism of personality is tantamount to a new creation, notwithstanding that you retain the same morontia form.</p>
<p id="p2_23"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_23">48:2.23</a></small></sup>  You may repeatedly subject yourself to the test of these <a href="/en/topic/examinations">examiners</a>, and as soon as you register adequate spiritual achievement, they will gladly certify you for advanced standing. These progressive changes result in altered reactions to the morontia environment, such as modifications in food requirements and numerous other personal practices.</p>
<p id="p2_24"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_24">48:2.24</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/selective_assorters">selective assorters</a> are also of great service in the grouping of <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> personalities for purposes of study, teaching, and other projects. They naturally indicate those who will best function in temporary association.</p>
<p id="p2_25"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_25">48:2.25</a></small></sup>  7. <i><a href="/en/topic/associate_registrars">Associate Registrars</a>.</i> The morontia world has its own <a href="/en/topic/recorders">recorders</a>, who serve in association with the spirit recorders in the supervision and custody of the records and other data indigenous to the morontia creations. The morontia records are available to all orders of personalities.</p>
<p id="p2_26"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_26">48:2.26</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> transition realms are accessible alike to material and spirit beings. As <a href="/en/topic/morontia_progressors">morontia progressors</a> you will remain in full contact with the material world and with material personalities, while you will increasingly discern and fraternize with spirit beings; and by the time of departure from the morontia regime, you will have seen all orders of spirits with the exception of a few of the higher types, such as <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. MORONTIA COMPANIONS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_1">48:3.1</a></small></sup>  These hosts of the mansion and <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> worlds are the offspring of a local universe Mother Spirit. They are created from age to age in groups of one hundred thousand, and in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> there are at present over seventy billion of these unique beings.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_2">48:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Companions">Morontia Companions</a> are trained for service by the Melchizedeks on a special planet near <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>; they do not pass through the central <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> schools. In service they range from the lowest mansion worlds of the systems to the highest study spheres of Salvington, but they are seldom encountered on the inhabited worlds. They serve under the general supervision of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> and under the immediate direction of the Melchizedeks.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_3">48:3.3</a></small></sup>  The Morontia Companions maintain ten thousand headquarters in a local universe‚Äîon each of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a> of the local systems. They are almost wholly a self-governing order and are, in general, an intelligent and loyal group of beings; but every now and then, in connection with certain unfortunate celestial upheavals, they have been known to go astray. Thousands of these useful creatures were lost during the times of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. Your local system now has its full quota of these beings, the loss of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> rebellion having only recently been made up.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_4">48:3.4</a></small></sup>  There are two distinct types of <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Companions">Morontia Companions</a>; one type is aggressive, the other retiring, but otherwise they are equal in status. They are not sex creatures, but they manifest a touchingly beautiful affection for one another. And while they are hardly companionate in the material (human) sense, they are very close of kin to the human races in the order of creature existence. The midway creatures of the worlds are your nearest of kin; then come the <a href="/en/topic/morontia_cherubim">morontia cherubim</a>, and after them the Morontia Companions.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_5">48:3.5</a></small></sup>  These companions are touchingly affectionate and charmingly social beings. They possess distinct personalities, and when you meet them on the mansion worlds, after learning to recognize them as a class, you will soon discern their individuality. Mortals all resemble one another; at the same time each of you possesses a distinct and recognizable personality.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_6">48:3.6</a></small></sup>  Something of an idea of the nature of the work of these <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Companions">Morontia Companions</a> may be derived from the following classification of their activities in a local system:</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_7">48:3.7</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Pilgrim Guardians</i> are not assigned to specific duties in their association with the <a href="/en/topic/morontia_progressors">morontia progressors</a>. These companions are responsible for the whole of the <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> career and are therefore the co-ordinators of the work of all other morontia and <a href="/en/topic/transition_ministers">transition ministers</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_8">48:3.8</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Pilgrim Receivers and Free Associators.</i> These are the social companions of the new arrivals on the <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a>. One of them will certainly be on hand to welcome you when you awaken on the initial mansion world from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> transit sleep of time, when you experience the <a href="/en/topic/resurrection">resurrection</a> from the death of the flesh into the morontia life. And from the time you are thus formally welcomed on awakening to that day when you leave the local universe as a first-stage spirit, these <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Companions">Morontia Companions</a> are ever with you.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_9">48:3.9</a></small></sup>  Companions are not assigned permanently to individuals. An <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortal</a> on one of the mansion or higher worlds might have a different companion on each of several successive occasions and again might go for long periods without one.

The <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Companions">Morontia Companions</a> are skillful play sponsors, and they are most ably supported by the <a href="/en/topic/reversion_directors">reversion directors</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_3">48:4.3</a></small></sup>  You would probably best understand the work of the reversion directors if they were likened to the higher types of humorists on Urantia, though that would be an exceedingly crude and somewhat unfortunate way in which to try to convey an idea of the function of these directors of change and relaxation, these ministers of the exalted humor of the <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> and spirit realms.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_4">48:4.4</a></small></sup>  In discussing spirit <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a>, first let me tell you what it is <i>not.</i> Spirit jest is never tinged with the accentuation of the misfortunes of the weak and erring. Neither is it ever blasphemous of the righteousness and glory of divinity. Our humor embraces three general levels of appreciation:</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_5">48:4.5</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Reminiscent jests.</i> Quips growing out of the memories of past episodes in one‚Äôs experience of combat, struggle, and sometimes fearfulness, and ofttimes foolish and childish anxiety. To us, this phase of humor derives from the deep-seated and abiding ability to draw upon the past for memory material with which pleasantly to flavor and otherwise lighten the heavy loads of the present.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_6">48:4.6</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Current <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a>.</i> The senselessness of much that so often causes us serious concern, the joy at discovering the unimportance of much of our serious personal <a href="/en/topic/anxiety">anxiety</a>.

<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_7">48:4.7</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Prophetic joy.</i> It will perhaps be difficult for <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> to envisage this phase of humor, but we do get a peculiar satisfaction out of the assurance ‚Äúthat all things work together for <a href="/en/topic/good">good</a>‚Äù‚Äîfor spirits and <a href="/en/topic/morontians">morontians</a> as well as for mortals<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

And in this connection they have the hearty co-operation of the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_artisans">celestial artisans</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_9">48:4.9</a></small></sup>  The reversion directors themselves are not a created group; they are a recruited corps embracing beings ranging from the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> down through the messenger hosts of space and the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> of time to the <a href="/en/topic/morontia_progressors">morontia progressors</a> from the evolutionary worlds. All are volunteers, giving themselves to the work of assisting their fellows in the achievement of thought change and mind <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a>, for such attitudes are most helpful in recuperating depleted energies.</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_10">48:4.10</a></small></sup>  When partially exhausted by the efforts of attainment, and while awaiting the reception of new energy charges, there is agreeable pleasure in living over again the enactments of other days and ages. <i>The early experiences of the race or the order are restful to reminisce.</i> And that is exactly why these artists are called <a href="/en/topic/reversion_directors">reversion directors</a>‚Äîthey assist in reverting the memory to a former state of development or to a less experienced status of being.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_11">48:4.11</a></small></sup>  All beings enjoy this sort of reversion except those who are inherent Creators, hence automatic self-rejuvenators, and certain highly specialized types of creatures, such as the <a href="/en/topic/power_centers">power centers</a> and the physical controllers, who are always and eternally thoroughly businesslike in all their reactions. These periodic releases from the tension of functional duty are a regular part of life on all worlds throughout the universe of universes but not on the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>. Beings indigenous to the central abode are incapable of depletion and are not, therefore, subject to re-energizing.

<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_12">48:4.12</a></small></sup>  Most of us have come up through lower stages of existence or through progressive levels of our orders, and it is refreshing and in a measure amusing to look back upon certain episodes of our early experience. There is a restfulness in the contemplation of that which is old to one‚Äôs order, and which lingers as a memory possession of the mind. The <a href="/en/topic/future">future</a> signifies struggle and advancement; it bespeaks work, effort, and achievement; but the <a href="/en/topic/past">past</a> savors of things already mastered and achieved; contemplation of the past permits of <a href="/en/topic/relaxation">relaxation</a> and such a carefree review as to provoke spirit mirth and a <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> state of mind verging on merriment.</p>

You of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> have allowed much that is at once vulgar and unkind to become confused with your humor, but on the whole, you are to be congratulated on a comparatively keen sense of humor. Some of your races have a rich vein of it and are greatly helped in their earthly careers thereby. Apparently you received much in the way of humor from your Adamic inheritance, much more than was secured of either music or art.</p>

The sense of celestial humor we have with us always, even when engaged in the most difficult of assignments. It helps to avoid an overdevelopment of the notion of one‚Äôs <a href="/en/topic/self-importance">self-importance</a>. But we do not give rein to it freely, as you might say, ‚Äúhave fun,‚Äù except when we are in recess from the serious assignments of our respective orders.</p>
<p id="p4_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_15">48:4.15</a></small></sup>  When we are tempted to magnify our self-importance, if we stop to contemplate the infinity of the greatness and grandeur of our Makers, our own self-glorification becomes sublimely ridiculous, even verging on the humorous. One of the functions of <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a> is to help all of us take ourselves less seriously. <i>Humor is the divine antidote for exaltation of ego<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_16">48:4.16</a></small></sup>  The need for the relaxation and diversion of humor is greatest in those orders of ascendant beings who are subjected to sustained stress in their upward struggles. The two extremes of life have little need for humorous diversions. Primitive men have no capacity therefor, and beings of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> perfection have no need thereof. The hosts of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> are naturally a joyous and exhilarating assemblage of supremely happy personalities. On Paradise the quality of worship obviates the necessity for reversion activities. But among those who start their careers far below the goal of Paradise perfection, there is a large place for the ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/reversion_directors">reversion directors</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_17">48:4.17</a></small></sup>  The higher the mortal species, the greater the stress and the greater the capacity for humor as well as the necessity for it. In the spirit world the opposite is true: The higher we ascend, the less the need for the diversions of reversion experiences. But proceeding down the scale of spirit life from Paradise to the <a href="/en/topic/seraphic_hosts">seraphic hosts</a>, there is an increasing need for the mission of mirth and the ministry of merriment. Those beings who most need the refreshment of periodic reversion to the intellectual status of previous experiences are the higher types of the human species, the <a href="/en/topic/morontians">morontians</a>, <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>, together with all similar types of personality.</p>
<p id="p4_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_18">48:4.18</a></small></sup>  Humor should function as an automatic safety valve to prevent the building up of excessive pressures due to the monotony of sustained and serious self-contemplation in association with the intense struggle for developmental progress and noble achievement. Humor also functions to lessen the shock of the unexpected impact of <a href="/en/topic/facts">fact</a> or of <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>, rigid unyielding fact and flexible ever-living truth. The mortal personality, never sure as to which will next be encountered, through <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a> swiftly grasps‚Äîsees the point and achieves <a href="/en/topic/insight">insight</a>‚Äîthe unexpected nature of the situation be it fact or be it truth.</p>
<p id="p4_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_19">48:4.19</a></small></sup>  While the humor of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is exceedingly crude and most inartistic, it does serve a valuable purpose both as a health insurance and as a liberator of emotional pressure, thus preventing injurious nervous tension and overserious self-contemplation. Humor and play‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/relaxation">relaxation</a>‚Äîare never reactions of progressive exertion; always are they the echoes of a backward glance, a reminiscence of the <a href="/en/topic/past">past</a>. Even on Urantia and as you now are, you always find it rejuvenating when for a short time you can suspend the exertions of the newer and higher intellectual efforts and revert to the more simple engagements of your ancestors.</p>
<p id="p4_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_20">48:4.20</a></small></sup>  The principles of Urantian play life are philosophically sound and continue to apply on up through your ascending life, through the circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> to the eternal shores of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. As ascendant beings you are in possession of personal memories of all former and lower existences, and without such identity memories of the past there would be no basis for the <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a> of the present, either mortal laughter or <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> mirth. It is this recalling of past experiences that provides the basis for present diversion and amusement. And so you will enjoy the celestial equivalents of your earthly humor all the way up through your long morontia, and then increasingly spiritual, careers. And that part of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> (the Adjuster) which becomes an eternal part of the personality of an ascendant mortal contributes the overtones of divinity to the joyous expressions, even spiritual laughter, of the ascending creatures of time and space.</p>
