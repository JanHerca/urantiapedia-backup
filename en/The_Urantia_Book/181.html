<p id="p0_1"><sup><small>181:0.1</small></sup>  AFTER the conclusion of the farewell discourse to the eleven, <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> visited informally with them and recounted many experiences which concerned them as a group and as individuals. At <a href="/topic/last">last</a> it was beginning to dawn upon these Galileans that their friend and teacher was going to leave them, and their hope grasped at the promise that, after a little while, he would again be with them, but they were prone to forget that this return visit was also for a little while. Many of the apostles and the leading <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a> really <a href="/topic/thought">thought</a> that this promise to return for a short season (the short interval between the <a href="/topic/resurrection">resurrection</a> and the ascension) indicated that Jesus was just going away for a brief visit with his Father, after which he would return to establish the <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a>. And such an interpretation of his teaching conformed both with their preconceived beliefs and with their ardent <a href="/topic/hopes">hopes</a>. Since their lifelong beliefs and hopes of <a href="/topic/wish_fulfillment">wish fulfillment</a> were thus agreed, it was not <a href="/topic/difficulties">difficult</a> for them to find an interpretation of the <a href="/topic/Master">Master</a>’s <a href="/topic/words">words</a> which would justify their intense longings.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small>181:0.2</small></sup>  After the farewell discourse had been discussed and had begun to settle down in their minds, Jesus again called the apostles to <a href="/topic/order">order</a> and began the impartation of his final admonitions and <a href="/topic/warnings">warnings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. LAST WORDS OF COMFORT </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small>181:1.1</small></sup>  When the eleven had taken their seats, <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> stood and addressed them: “As long as I am with you in the <a href="/topic/flesh">flesh</a>, I can be but one <a href="/topic/individual">individual</a> in your midst or in the entire <a href="/topic/world_(earth)">world</a>. But when I have been delivered from this investment of mortal <a href="/topic/nature">nature</a>, I <a href="/topic/will">will</a> be able to return as a <a href="/topic/spirit">spirit</a> indweller of each of you and of all other <a href="/topic/believers">believers</a> in this <a href="/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a>. In this <a href="/topic/way">way</a> the <a href="/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> will become a spiritual <a href="/topic/incarnation">incarnation</a> in the souls of all true <a href="/topic/religionists">believers</a><sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small>181:1.2</small></sup>  “When I have returned to live in you and work through you, I can the better <a href="/topic/lead">lead</a> you on through this <a href="/topic/life">life</a> and guide you through the many <a href="/topic/abodes">abodes</a> in the <a href="/topic/future">future</a> life in the <a href="/topic/heaven">heaven</a> of heavens<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. Life in the Father’s eternal <a href="/topic/creation">creation</a> is not an endless <a href="/topic/rest">rest</a> of <a href="/topic/idleness">idleness</a> and selfish <a href="/topic/ease">ease</a> but rather a ceaseless progression in <a href="/topic/grace_(God’s_mercy)">grace</a>, <a href="/topic/truth">truth</a>, and <a href="/topic/glory">glory</a>. Each of the many, many stations in my <a href="/topic/Father’s_house">Father’s house</a> is a stopping place, a life designed to prepare you for the next one ahead. And so will the <a href="/topic/children">children</a> of <a href="/topic/light">light</a> go on from glory to glory until they attain the divine estate wherein they are spiritually perfected even as the Father is perfect in all things<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small>181:1.3</small></sup>  “If you would follow after me when I leave you, put forth your earnest efforts to live in accordance with the <a href="/topic/spirit">spirit</a> of my teachings and with the ideal of my life—the doing of my Father’s <a href="/topic/will">will</a><sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>. This do instead of trying to imitate my natural life in the <a href="/topic/flesh">flesh</a> as I have, perforce, been required to live it on this <a href="/topic/world_(earth)">world</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small>181:1.4</small></sup>  “The Father sent me into this world, but only a few of you have chosen fully to receive me<sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>. I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, but all men will not choose to receive this new teacher as the guide and counselor of the <a href="/topic/soul">soul</a><sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>. But as many as do receive him shall be enlightened, cleansed, and comforted. And this <a href="/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> will become in them a well of <a href="/topic/living">living</a> <a href="/topic/water">water</a> springing up into <a href="/topic/eternal_life">eternal life</a><sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small>181:1.5</small></sup>  “And now, as I am about to leave you, I would speak <a href="/topic/words">words</a> of comfort. Peace I leave with you; my <a href="/topic/peace">peace</a> I give to you. I make these <a href="/topic/gifts">gifts</a> not as the <a href="/topic/world_(earth)">world</a> gives—by measure—I give each of you all you <a href="/topic/will">will</a> receive. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be <a href="/topic/fear">fearful</a><sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup>. I have overcome the world, and in me you shall all <a href="/topic/triumph">triumph</a> through <a href="/topic/faith">faith</a><sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup>. I have warned you that the <a href="/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> will be killed, but I assure you I will come back before I go to the Father, even though it be for only a little while<sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup>. And after I have ascended to the Father, I will surely send the new teacher to be with you and to abide in your very <a href="/topic/hearts">hearts</a><sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup>. And when you see all this come to pass, be not dismayed, but rather believe, inasmuch as you knew it all beforehand<sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup>. I have loved you with a great <a href="/topic/affection">affection</a>, and I would not leave you, but it is the Father’s will<sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup>. My hour has come.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small>181:1.6</small></sup>  “Doubt not any of these truths even after you are scattered abroad by <a href="/topic/persecution">persecution</a> and are downcast by many sorrows. When you feel that you are alone in the world, I will know of your <a href="/topic/isolation">isolation</a> even as, when you are scattered every <a href="/topic/man">man</a> to his own place, leaving the Son of Man in the <a href="/topic/hands">hands</a> of his <a href="/topic/enemies">enemies</a>, you will know of mine. But I am never alone; always is the Father with me<sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup>. Even at such a <a href="/topic/time">time</a> I will pray for you. And all of these things have I told you that you <a href="/topic/might">might</a> have peace and have it more abundantly. In this world you will have tribulation, but be of <a href="/topic/good">good</a> cheer; I have triumphed in the world and shown you the <a href="/topic/way">way</a> to eternal <a href="/topic/joy">joy</a> and everlasting <a href="/topic/service">service</a>.”</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small>181:1.7</small></sup>  <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> gives <a href="/topic/peace">peace</a> to his fellow doers of the <a href="/topic/will_of_God">will of God</a> but not on the <a href="/topic/order">order</a> of the joys and satisfactions of this material <a href="/topic/world_(earth)">world</a><sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup>. Unbelieving materialists and <a href="/topic/fatalism">fatalists</a> can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and <a href="/topic/soul">soul</a> comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and to endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small>181:1.8</small></sup>  A certain amount of both <a href="/topic/stoicism_(attitude)">stoicism</a> and <a href="/topic/optimism">optimism</a> are serviceable in <a href="/topic/living">living</a> a <a href="/topic/life">life</a> on <a href="/topic/earth">earth</a>, but neither has aught to do with that superb peace which the <a href="/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a> bestows upon his <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a> in the <a href="/topic/flesh">flesh</a>. The peace which <a href="/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> gives his <a href="/topic/children">children</a> on earth is that very peace which filled his own soul when he himself lived the mortal life in the flesh and on this very world. The peace of Jesus is the <a href="/topic/joy">joy</a> and satisfaction of a God-knowing <a href="/topic/individual">individual</a> who has achieved the <a href="/topic/triumph">triumph</a> of learning fully how to do the will of God while living the mortal life in the flesh. The peace of Jesus’ <a href="/topic/mind">mind</a> was founded on an absolute human <a href="/topic/faith">faith</a> in the actuality of the divine Father’s wise and sympathetic overcare. Jesus had trouble on earth, he has even been falsely called the “<a href="/topic/man_of_sorrows">man of sorrows</a>,” but in and through all of these experiences he enjoyed the comfort of that <a href="/topic/confidence">confidence</a> which ever empowered him to proceed with his life purpose in the full <a href="/topic/assurance">assurance</a> that he was achieving the Father’s will<sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small>181:1.9</small></sup>  <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was determined, persistent, and thoroughly devoted to the accomplishment of his mission, but he was not an unfeeling and calloused stoic; he ever sought for the <a href="/topic/happiness">cheerful</a> aspects of his life experiences, but he was not a <a href="/topic/blind">blind</a> and self-deceived optimist. The <a href="/topic/Master">Master</a> knew all that was to befall him, and he was unafraid. After he had bestowed this <a href="/topic/peace">peace</a> upon each of his followers, he could consistently say, “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid<sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small>181:1.10</small></sup>  The peace of Jesus is, then, the peace and <a href="/topic/assurance">assurance</a> of a son who fully believes that his career for <a href="/topic/time">time</a> and <a href="/topic/eternity">eternity</a> is safely and wholly in the care and keeping of an all-wise, all-loving, and all-powerful <a href="/topic/spirit">spirit</a> Father. And this is, indeed, a peace which passes the <a href="/topic/understanding">understanding</a> of <a href="/topic/mortal_mind">mortal mind</a>, but which can be enjoyed to the full by the believing human heart<sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. FAREWELL PERSONAL ADMONITIONS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small>181:2.1</small></sup>  The <a href="/topic/Master">Master</a> had finished giving his farewell instructions and imparting his final admonitions to the apostles as a group. He then addressed himself to saying good-bye individually and to giving each a word of personal <a href="/topic/advice">advice</a>, together with his parting blessing. The apostles were still seated about the table as when they <a href="/topic/first">first</a> sat down to partake of the <a href="/topic/Last_Supper">Last Supper</a>, and as the Master went around the table talking to them, each <a href="/topic/man">man</a> rose to his <a href="/topic/feet">feet</a> when <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> addressed him.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small>181:2.2</small></sup>  To John, Jesus said: “You, John, are the youngest of my <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a>. You have been very near me, and while I <a href="/topic/love">love</a> you all with the same love which a father bestows upon his sons, you were designated by <a href="/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> as one of the <a href="/topic/3">three</a> who should always be near me. Besides this, you have acted for me and must continue so to act in many matters concerning my earthly <a href="/topic/family">family</a><sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup>. And I go to the Father, John, having full <a href="/topic/confidence">confidence</a> that you <a href="/topic/will">will</a> continue to watch over those who are mine in the <a href="/topic/flesh">flesh</a>. See to it that their <a href="/topic/present">present</a> <a href="/topic/confusion">confusion</a> regarding my mission does not in any <a href="/topic/way">way</a> prevent your extending to them all <a href="/topic/sympathy">sympathy</a>, <a href="/topic/counsel">counsel</a>, and help even as you know I would if I were to remain in the flesh. And when they all come to see the <a href="/topic/light">light</a> and enter fully into the <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a>, while you all will welcome them joyously, I depend upon you, John, to welcome them for me.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small>181:2.3</small></sup>  “And now, as I enter upon the closing hours of my earthly career, remain near at hand that I may leave any message with you regarding my family. As concerns the work put in my <a href="/topic/hands">hands</a> by the Father, it is now finished except for my <a href="/topic/death">death</a> in the flesh, and I am ready to drink this <a href="/topic/last">last</a> <a href="/topic/cup">cup</a><sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup>. But as for the responsibilities left to me by my earthly father, <a href="/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, while I have attended to these during my <a href="/topic/life">life</a>, I must now depend upon you to act in my stead in all these matters. And I have chosen you to do this for me, John, because you are the youngest and will therefore very likely outlive these other apostles.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small>181:2.4</small></sup>  “Once we called you and your brother <a href="/topic/sons_of_thunder">sons of thunder</a><sup id="cite27"><a href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup>. You started out with us strong-minded and intolerant, but you have changed much since you wanted me to call <a href="/topic/fire">fire</a> down upon the heads of ignorant and thoughtless <a href="/topic/unbelievers">unbelievers</a><sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup>. And you must <a href="/topic/change">change</a> yet more. You should become the apostle of the <a href="/topic/new_commandment">new commandment</a> which I have this night given you. Dedicate your life to teaching your <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a> how to <a href="/topic/love">love</a> one another, even as I have loved you<sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small>181:2.5</small></sup>  As <a href="/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> stood there in the upper chamber, the <a href="/topic/tears">tears</a> rolling down his cheeks, he looked into the <a href="/topic/Master">Master</a>’s face and said: “And so I <a href="/topic/will">will</a>, my Master, but how can I learn to love my brethren more?” And then answered <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>: “You will learn to love your brethren more when you <a href="/topic/first">first</a> learn to love their Father in <a href="/topic/heaven">heaven</a> more, and after you have become truly more interested in their <a href="/topic/welfare_(government)">welfare</a> in <a href="/topic/time">time</a> and in <a href="/topic/eternity">eternity</a>. And all such human interest is fostered by <a href="/topic/understanding">understanding</a> <a href="/topic/sympathy">sympathy</a>, unselfish <a href="/topic/service">service</a>, and unstinted <a href="/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a>. No <a href="/topic/man">man</a> should despise your youth, but I exhort you always to give due <a href="/topic/consideration">consideration</a> to the <a href="/topic/facts">fact</a> that age oftentimes represents <a href="/topic/experience">experience</a>, and that nothing in human affairs can take the place of <a href="/topic/actual">actual</a> experience. Strive to live peaceably with all men, especially your friends in the <a href="/topic/brotherhood_(attitude)">brotherhood</a> of the heavenly <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a><sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup>. And, John, always remember, strive not with the souls you would win for the kingdom<sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small>181:2.6</small></sup>  And then the Master, passing around his own seat, paused a moment by the side of the place of <a href="/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>. The apostles were rather surprised that Judas had not returned before this, and they were very <a href="/topic/curiosity">curious</a> to know the significance of Jesus’ sad countenance as he stood by the <a href="/topic/betrayer">betrayer</a>’s vacant seat. But none of them, except possibly <a href="/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, entertained even the slightest <a href="/topic/thought">thought</a> that their treasurer had gone out to betray his Master, as Jesus had intimated to them earlier in the evening and during the supper. So much had been going on that, for the time <a href="/topic/being">being</a>, they had quite forgotten about the Master’s announcement that one of them would betray him.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small>181:2.7</small></sup>  <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> now went over to <a href="/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, who stood up and listened to this admonition: “You are a true son of <a href="/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>, but what a <a href="/topic/time">time</a> I have had trying to make you a son of this heavenly <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a>. I <a href="/topic/love">love</a> you and so do all of your <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a>. I know that you love me, <a href="/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, and that you also love the kingdom, but you are still set on making this kingdom come according to your liking. I know full well that you <a href="/topic/will">will</a> eventually grasp the spiritual <a href="/topic/nature">nature</a> and meaning of my <a href="/topic/gospel">gospel</a>, and that you will do valiant work in its proclamation, but I am distressed about what may happen to you when I depart. I would rejoice to know that you would not falter; I would be made <a href="/topic/happiness">happy</a> if I could know that, after I go to the Father, you would not cease to be my apostle, and that you would acceptably deport yourself as an ambassador of the heavenly kingdom.”</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small>181:2.8</small></sup>  Jesus had hardly ceased speaking to Simon Zelotes when the fiery patriot, drying his <a href="/topic/eyes">eyes</a>, replied: “<a href="/topic/Master">Master</a>, have no <a href="/topic/fear">fears</a> for my <a href="/topic/loyalty">loyalty</a>. I have turned my back upon everything that I <a href="/topic/might">might</a> dedicate my <a href="/topic/life">life</a> to the establishment of your kingdom on <a href="/topic/earth">earth</a>, and I will not falter. I have survived every <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a> so far, and I will not forsake you.”</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small>181:2.9</small></sup>  And then, laying his <a href="/topic/hands">hand</a> on <a href="/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>’s shoulder, <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “It is indeed refreshing to hear you talk like that, especially at such a <a href="/topic/time">time</a> as this, but, my <a href="/topic/good">good</a> friend, you still do not know what you are talking about. Not for one moment would I <a href="/topic/doubt">doubt</a> your loyalty, your <a href="/topic/devotion">devotion</a>; I know you would not hesitate to go forth in battle and <a href="/topic/death">die</a> for me, as all these others would” (and they all nodded a vigorous approval), “but that <a href="/topic/will">will</a> not be required of you. I have repeatedly told you that my <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a> is not of this <a href="/topic/world_(earth)">world</a>, and that my <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a> will not <a href="/topic/fighting">fight</a> to effect its establishment. I have told you this many times, <a href="/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a>, but you refuse to face the <a href="/topic/truth">truth</a><sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup>. I am not concerned with your loyalty to me and to the kingdom, but what will you do when I go away and you at <a href="/topic/last">last</a> wake up to the realization that you have failed to grasp the meaning of my teaching, and that you must adjust your misconceptions to the <a href="/topic/reality">reality</a> of another and spiritual <a href="/topic/order">order</a> of affairs in the kingdom?”</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small>181:2.10</small></sup>  Simon wanted to speak further, but Jesus raised his hand and, stopping him, went on to say: “None of my apostles are more sincere and honest at heart than you, but not one of them will be so upset and disheartened as you, after my departure. In all of your <a href="/topic/discouragement">discouragement</a> my spirit shall abide with you, and these, your <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a>, will not forsake you. Do not forget what I have taught you regarding the relation of <a href="/topic/citizenship">citizenship</a> on <a href="/topic/earth">earth</a> to sonship in the Father’s spiritual kingdom. Ponder well all that I have said to you about rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and to <a href="/topic/God">God</a> that which is God’s<sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup>. Dedicate your <a href="/topic/life">life</a>, Simon, to showing how acceptably mortal <a href="/topic/man">man</a> may fulfill my <a href="/topic/commandments">injunction</a> concerning the simultaneous <a href="/topic/recognition">recognition</a> of temporal <a href="/topic/duty">duty</a> to civil powers and spiritual <a href="/topic/service">service</a> in the <a href="/topic/brotherhood_(attitude)">brotherhood</a> of the kingdom. If you will be taught by the <a href="/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a>, never will there be <a href="/topic/conflict">conflict</a> between the requirements of citizenship on earth and sonship in <a href="/topic/heaven">heaven</a> unless the temporal rulers presume to require of you the homage and <a href="/topic/worship">worship</a> which belong only to God.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small>181:2.11</small></sup>  “And now, <a href="/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, when you do finally see all of this, and after you have shaken off your <a href="/topic/depression">depression</a> and have gone forth proclaiming this <a href="/topic/gospel">gospel</a> in great <a href="/topic/power">power</a>, never forget that I was with you even through all of your season of discouragement, and that I <a href="/topic/will">will</a> go on with you to the very <a href="/topic/end">end</a><sup id="cite34"><a href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup>. You shall always be my apostle, and after you become willing to see by the <a href="/topic/eyes">eye</a> of the <a href="/topic/spirit">spirit</a> and more fully to yield your will to the will of the Father in heaven, then will you return to <a href="/topic/labor">labor</a> as my ambassador, and no one shall take away from you the <a href="/topic/authority">authority</a> which I have conferred upon you, because of your slowness of comprehending the truths I have taught you. And so, <a href="/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a>, once more I warn you that they who <a href="/topic/fighting">fight</a> with the sword perish with the sword, while they who labor in the spirit achieve life everlasting in the <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a> to come with <a href="/topic/joy">joy</a> and <a href="/topic/peace">peace</a> in the kingdom which now is<sup id="cite36"><a href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite37"><a href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup>. And when the work given into your <a href="/topic/hands">hands</a> is finished on earth, you, <a href="/topic/Simon_the_tanner">Simon</a>, shall sit down with me in my kingdom over there.

You know it is written, ‘The <a href="/topic/shepherd">shepherd</a> will be smitten and the <a href="/topic/sheep">sheep</a> will be scattered abroad.’ When I am absent, there is great danger that some of you will succumb to doubts and stumble because of what befalls me<sup id="cite62"><a href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup>. But I promise you now that I will come back to you for a little while, and that I will then go before you into <a href="/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a><sup id="cite63"><a href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_28"><sup><small>181:2.28</small></sup>  Then said Peter, placing his <a href="/topic/hands">hand</a> on <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ shoulder: “No <a href="/topic/matter">matter</a> if all my <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a> should succumb to doubts because of you, I promise that I <a href="/topic/will">will</a> not stumble over anything you may do.

<p id="p2_29"><sup><small>181:2.29</small></sup>  As <a href="/topic/Peter">Peter</a> stood there before his <a href="/topic/Master">Master</a>, all atremble with intense <a href="/topic/emotions">emotion</a> and overflowing with genuine <a href="/topic/love">love</a> for him, Jesus looked straight into his moistened <a href="/topic/eyes">eyes</a> as he said: “<a href="/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, verily, verily, I say to you, this night the <a href="/topic/cock">cock</a> will not crow until you have denied me <a href="/topic/3">three</a> or four times<sup id="cite65"><a href="#fn65">[65]</a></sup>.

<p id="p2_30"><sup><small>181:2.30</small></sup>  “But remember my promise: When I am raised up, I <a href="/topic/will">will</a> tarry with you for a season before I go to the Father<sup id="cite67"><a href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite68"><a href="#fn68">[68]</a></sup>.
