<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p0_1">14:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE perfect and divine universe occupies the center of all creation; it is the eternal core around which the vast creations of time and space revolve. <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> is the gigantic nuclear Isle of absolute stability which rests motionless at the very heart of the magnificent eternal universe. This central planetary family is called <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and is far-distant from the local universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. It is of enormous dimensions and almost unbelievable mass and consists of one billion spheres of unimagined beauty and superb grandeur, but the true magnitude of this vast creation is really beyond the understanding grasp of the human mind.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p0_2">14:0.2</a></small></sup>  This is the one and only settled, perfect, and established aggregation of worlds. This is a wholly created and perfect universe; it is not an evolutionary development. This is the eternal core of perfection, about which swirls that endless procession of universes which constitute the tremendous evolutionary experiment, the audacious adventure of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, who aspire to duplicate in time and to reproduce in space the pattern universe, the ideal of divine completeness, supreme finality, ultimate reality, and eternal perfection.</p>

<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_9">14:1.9</a></small></sup>  The billion worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> are arranged in seven concentric circuits immediately surrounding the three circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> satellites. There are upwards of thirty-five million worlds in the innermost Havona circuit and over two hundred and forty-five million in the outermost, with proportionate numbers intervening. Each circuit differs, but all are perfectly balanced and exquisitely organized, and each is pervaded by a specialized representation of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, one of the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Spirits_of_Havona_Circuits">Seven Spirits of the Circuits</a>. In addition to other functions this impersonal Spirit co-ordinates the conduct of celestial affairs throughout each circuit.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_10">14:1.10</a></small></sup>  The Havona planetary circuits are not superimposed; their worlds follow each other in an orderly linear procession. The central universe whirls around the stationary <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a> in one vast plane, consisting of ten concentric stabilized units—the three circuits of Paradise spheres and the seven circuits of Havona worlds. Physically regarded, the Havona and the Paradise circuits are all one and the same system; their separation is in recognition of functional and administrative segregation.</p>

<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_11">14:1.11</a></small></sup>  Time is not reckoned on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>; the sequence of successive events is inherent in the concept of those who are indigenous to the central Isle. But <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a> is germane to the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> circuits and to numerous beings of both celestial and terrestrial origin sojourning thereon. Each Havona world has its own local time, determined by its circuit. All worlds in a given circuit have the same length of year since they uniformly swing around Paradise, and the length of these planetary years decreases from the outermost to the innermost circuit.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_12">14:1.12</a></small></sup>  Besides Havona-circuit time, there is the Paradise-Havona standard day and other time designations which are determined on, and are sent out from, the seven Paradise satellites of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. The Paradise-Havona standard day is based on the length of time required for the planetary abodes of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> or inner Havona circuit to complete one revolution around the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>; and though their velocity is enormous, owing to their situation between the dark gravity bodies and gigantic Paradise, it requires almost one thousand years for these spheres to complete their circuit. You have unwittingly read the truth when your eyes rested on the statement “A day is as a thousand years with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, as but a watch in the night.” One Paradise-Havona day is just seven minutes, three and one-eighth seconds less than one thousand years of the present <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/Gregorian_calendar">leap-year calendar</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_13">14:1.13</a></small></sup>  This Paradise-Havona day is the standard <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a> measurement for the seven superuniverses, although each maintains its own internal time standards.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_14">14:1.14</a></small></sup>  On the outskirts of this vast central universe, far out beyond the seventh belt of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds, there swirl an unbelievable number of enormous <a href="/en/topic/dark_gravity_bodies">dark gravity bodies</a>. These multitudinous dark masses are quite unlike other space bodies in many particulars; even in form they are very different. These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light; they are nonreactive to physical-energy light, and they so completely encircle and enshroud Havona as to hide it from the view of even near-by inhabited universes of time and space.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_15">14:1.15</a></small></sup>  The great belt of dark gravity bodies is divided into two equal elliptical circuits by a unique space intrusion. The inner belt revolves counterclockwise; the outer revolves clockwise. These alternate directions of motion, coupled with the extraordinary mass of the dark bodies, so effectively equalize the lines of Havona gravity as to render the central universe a physically balanced and perfectly stabilized creation.</p>
<p id="p1_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_16">14:1.16</a></small></sup>  The inner procession of <a href="/en/topic/dark_gravity_bodies">dark gravity bodies</a> is tubular in arrangement, consisting of three circular groupings. A cross section of this circuit would exhibit three concentric circles of about equal <a href="/en/topic/density">density</a>. The outer circuit of dark gravity bodies is arranged perpendicularly, being ten thousand times higher than the inner circuit. The up-and-down diameter of the outer circuit is fifty thousand times that of the transverse diameter.</p>
<p id="p1_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_17">14:1.17</a></small></sup>  The intervening space which exists between these two circuits of gravity bodies is <i>unique</i> in that nothing like it is to be found elsewhere in all the wide universe. This zone is characterized by enormous wave movements of an up-and-down nature and is permeated by tremendous energy activities of an unknown order.</p>
<p id="p1_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_18">14:1.18</a></small></sup>  In our opinion, nothing like the <a href="/en/topic/dark_gravity_bodies">dark gravity bodies</a> of the central universe will characterize the future evolution of the outer space levels; we regard these alternate processions of stupendous gravity-balancing bodies as unique in the master universe.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. CONSTITUTION OF HAVONA </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_1">14:2.1</a></small></sup>  Spirit beings do not dwell in nebulous space; they do not inhabit ethereal worlds; they are domiciled on actual spheres of a material nature, worlds just as real as those on which <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> live. The <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds are actual and literal, albeit their literal substance differs from the material organization of the <a href="/en/topic/planets">planets</a> of the seven superuniverses.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_2">14:2.2</a></small></sup>  The physical realities of Havona represent an order of energy organization radically different from any prevailing in the evolutionary universes of space. Havona energies are threefold; superuniverse units of energy-matter contain a twofold energy charge, although one form of energy exists in negative and positive phases. The creation of the central universe is threefold (<a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a>); the creation of a local universe (directly) is twofold, by a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and a Creative Spirit.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_3">14:2.3</a></small></sup>  The material of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> consists of the organization of exactly one thousand basic chemical <a href="/en/topic/elements_(natural)">elements</a> and the balanced function of the seven forms of Havona <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a>. Each of these basic energies manifests seven phases of excitation, so that the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> respond to forty-nine differing sensation stimuli. In other words, viewed from a purely physical standpoint, the natives of the central universe possess forty-nine specialized forms of sensation. The morontia <a href="/en/topic/senses">senses</a> are seventy, and the higher spiritual orders of reaction response vary in different types of beings from seventy to two hundred and ten.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_4">14:2.4</a></small></sup>  None of the physical beings of the central universe would be visible to Urantians. Neither would any of the physical stimuli of those faraway worlds excite a reaction in your gross sense organs. If a <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> mortal could be transported to Havona, he would there be deaf, blind, and utterly lacking in all other sense reactions; he could only function as a limited self-conscious being deprived of all environmental stimuli and all reactions thereto.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_5">14:2.5</a></small></sup>  There are numerous physical phenomena and spiritual reactions transpiring in the central creation which are unknown on worlds such as Urantia. The basic organization of a threefold creation is wholly unlike that of the twofold constitution of the created universes of time and space.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_6">14:2.6</a></small></sup>  All natural law is co-ordinated on a basis entirely different than in the dual-energy systems of the evolving creations. The entire central universe is organized in accordance with the threefold system of perfect and symmetrical control. Throughout the whole <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a> there is maintained a perfect balance between all cosmic realities and all spiritual forces. <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, with an absolute grasp of material creation, perfectly regulates and maintains the physical energies of this central universe; the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, as a part of his all-embracing spirit grasp, most perfectly sustains the spiritual status of all who indwell <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>. On Paradise nothing is experimental, and the Paradise-Havona system is a unit of creative perfection.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_7">14:2.7</a></small></sup>  The universal spiritual gravity of the Eternal Son is amazingly active throughout the central universe<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>. All spirit <a href="/en/topic/values">values</a> and spiritual personalities are unceasingly drawn inward towards the abode of the Gods. This Godward urge is intense and inescapable. The ambition to attain <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is stronger in the central universe, not because spirit gravity is stronger than in the outlying universes, but because those beings who have attained Havona are more fully spiritualized and hence more responsive to the ever-present action of the universal spirit-gravity pull of the Eternal Son.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_8">14:2.8</a></small></sup>  Likewise does the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> draw all intellectual values Paradiseward. Throughout the central universe the <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> gravity of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit functions in liaison with the spirit gravity of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, and these together constitute the combined urge of the ascendant souls to find God, to attain <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, to achieve <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, and to know the Father.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_9">14:2.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is a spiritually perfect and physically stable universe. The control and balanced stability of the central universe appear to be perfect. Everything physical or spiritual is perfectly predictable, but mind phenomena and <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> volition are not. We do infer that <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> can be reckoned as impossible of occurrence, but we do this on the ground that the native freewill creatures of Havona have never been guilty of transgressing the will of Deity. Through all eternity these supernal beings have been consistently loyal to the <a href="/en/topic/Eternals_of_Days">Eternals of Days</a>. Neither has sin appeared in any creature who has entered Havona as a pilgrim. There has never been an instance of misconduct by any creature of any group of personalities ever created in, or admitted to, the central Havona universe. So perfect and so divine are the methods and means of selection in the universes of time that never in the records of Havona has an error occurred; no mistakes have ever been made; no ascendant soul has ever been prematurely admitted to the central universe.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE HAVONA WORLDS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_1">14:3.1</a></small></sup>  Concerning the <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> of the central universe, there is none. <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is so exquisitely perfect that no intellectual system of government is required. There are no regularly constituted courts, neither are there legislative assemblies; Havona requires only administrative direction. Here may be observed the height of the ideals of true <i>self-</i>government.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_2">14:3.2</a></small></sup>  There is no need of government among such perfect and near-perfect intelligences. They stand in no need of regulation, for they are beings of native perfection interspersed with evolutionary creatures who have long since passed the scrutiny of the supreme tribunals of the superuniverses.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_3">14:3.3</a></small></sup>  The administration of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is not automatic, but it is marvelously perfect and divinely efficient. It is chiefly planetary and is vested in the resident Eternal of Days, each Havona sphere being directed by one of these Trinity-origin personalities. <a href="/en/topic/Eternals_of_Days">Eternals of Days</a> are not creators, but they are perfect administrators. They teach with supreme skill and direct their planetary children with a perfection of wisdom bordering on absoluteness.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_4">14:3.4</a></small></sup>  The billion spheres of the central universe constitute the training worlds of the high personalities native to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and Havona and further serve as the final proving grounds for ascending creatures from the evolutionary worlds of time. In the execution of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>’s great plan of creature ascension the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> are landed on the receiving worlds of the outer or seventh circuit, and subsequent to increased training and enlarged experience, they are progressively advanced inward, planet by planet and circle by circle, until they finally attain the Deities and achieve residence on Paradise.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_5">14:3.5</a></small></sup>  At present, although the spheres of the seven circuits are maintained in all their supernal glory, only about one per cent of all planetary capacity is utilized in the work of furthering the Father’s universal plan of mortal ascension. About one tenth of one per cent of the area of these enormous worlds is dedicated to the life and activities of the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>, beings eternally settled in light and life who often sojourn and minister on the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds. These exalted beings have their personal residences on Paradise.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_6">14:3.6</a></small></sup>  The planetary construction of the Havona spheres is entirely unlike that of the evolutionary worlds and systems of space. Nowhere else in all the grand universe is it convenient to utilize such enormous spheres as inhabited worlds. Triata physical constitution, coupled with the balancing effect of the immense dark gravity bodies, makes it possible so perfectly to equalize the physical forces and so exquisitely to balance the various attractions of this tremendous creation. <a href="/en/topic/antigravity">Antigravity</a> is also employed in the organization of the material functions and the spiritual activities of these enormous worlds.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_7">14:3.7</a></small></sup>  The architecture, lighting, and heating, as well as the biologic and artistic embellishment, of the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> spheres, are quite beyond the greatest possible stretch of human imagination. You cannot be told much about Havona; to understand its beauty and grandeur you must see it. But there are real rivers and lakes on these perfect worlds.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p3_8">14:3.8</a></small></sup>  Spiritually these worlds are ideally appointed; they are fittingly adapted to their purpose of harboring the numerous orders of differing beings who function in the central universe. Manifold activities take place on these beautiful worlds which are far beyond human comprehension.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. CREATURES OF THE CENTRAL UNIVERSE </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_1">14:4.1</a></small></sup>  There are seven basic forms of living things and beings on the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds, and each of these basic forms exists in three distinct phases. Each of these three phases is divided into seventy major divisions, and each major division is composed of one thousand minor divisions, with yet other subdivisions, and so on. These basic life groups might be classified as:</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_2">14:4.2</a></small></sup>  1. Material.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_3">14:4.3</a></small></sup>  2. Morontial.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_4">14:4.4</a></small></sup>  3. Spiritual.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_5">14:4.5</a></small></sup>  4. Absonite.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_6">14:4.6</a></small></sup>  5. <a href="/en/topic/Ultimate">Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_7">14:4.7</a></small></sup>  6. Coabsolute.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_8">14:4.8</a></small></sup>  7. <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_9">14:4.9</a></small></sup>  Decay and death are not a part of the cycle of life on the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> worlds. In the central universe the lower living things undergo the transmutation of materialization. They do change form and manifestation, but they do not resolve by process of decay and cellular death.</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_10">14:4.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> are all the offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>. They are without creature parents, and they are nonreproducing beings. We cannot portray the creation of these citizens of the central universe, beings who never were created. The entire <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the creation of Havona is an attempt to time-space an <a href="/en/topic/eternity">eternity</a> fact which has no relation to time or space as mortal man comprehends them. But we must concede human philosophy a point of origin; even personalities far above the human level require a concept of “beginnings.” Nevertheless, the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a> is eternal.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_11">14:4.11</a></small></sup>  The natives of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> live on the billion spheres of the central universe in the same sense that other orders of permanent citizenship dwell on their respective spheres of nativity. As the material order of sonship carries on the material, intellectual, and spiritual economy of a billion local systems in a superuniverse, so, in a larger sense, do the Havona natives live and function on the billion worlds of the central universe. You might possibly regard these <a href="/en/topic/Havoners">Havoners</a> as material <a href="/en/topic/creatures">creatures</a> in the sense that the word “material” could be expanded to describe the physical realities of the divine universe.</p>

<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_13">14:4.13</a></small></sup>  As the worship of the faith sons of the evolutionary worlds ministers to the satisfaction of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>’s love, so the exalted adoration of the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> creatures satiates the perfect ideals of divine beauty and truth. As mortal man strives to do the <a href="/en/topic/will_of_God">will of God</a>, these beings of the central universe live to gratify the ideals of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>.

<p id="p4_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_14">14:4.14</a></small></sup>  Havoners have both optional present and future unrevealed destinies. And there is a progression of native creatures that is peculiar to the central universe, a progression that involves neither ascent to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> nor penetration of the superuniverses. This progression to higher Havona status may be suggested as follows:</p>
<p id="p4_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_15">14:4.15</a></small></sup>  1. Experiential progress outward from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to the seventh circuit.</p>

All beings in all universes are fashioned along the lines of some one order of pattern creature living on some one of the billion worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>. Even the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of time have their goal and ideals of creature existence on the outer circuits of these pattern spheres on high.</p>
<p id="p4_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_19">14:4.19</a></small></sup>  Then there are those beings who have attained the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, and who are entitled to go and come, who are assigned here and there in the universes on missions of special service. And on every Havona world will be found the attainment candidates, those who have physically attained the central universe, but who have not yet achieved that spiritual development which will enable them to claim <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> residence.</p>

On these worlds of divine perfection they perform the work indigenous to the normal conduct of this vast creation and, in addition, carry on the manifold tasks of teaching, training, and ministering to the enormous numbers of ascendant creatures who have climbed to glory from the dark worlds of space.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_1">14:5.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> you pass through a short and intense test during your initial <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> of material existence. On the mansion worlds and up through your system, constellation, and local universe, you traverse the morontia phases of ascension. On the training worlds of the superuniverse you pass through the true spirit stages of progression and are prepared for eventual transit to <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>. On the seven circuits of Havona your attainment is intellectual, spiritual, and experiential. And there is a definite task to be achieved on each of the worlds of each of these circuits.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_2">14:5.2</a></small></sup>  Life on the divine worlds of the central universe is so rich and full, so complete and replete, that it wholly transcends the human concept of anything a created being could possibly experience. The social and economic activities of this eternal creation are entirely dissimilar to the occupations of material creatures living on evolutionary worlds like Urantia. Even the technique of Havona <a href="/en/topic/thought">thought</a> is unlike the process of thinking on Urantia.</p>

<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_3">14:5.3</a></small></sup>  The regulations of the central universe are fittingly and inherently natural; the rules of conduct are not arbitrary. In every requirement of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> there is disclosed the reason of <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a> and the rule of justice. And these two factors, combined, equal what on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> would be denominated <i><a href="/en/topic/fairness">fairness</a>.</i> When you arrive in Havona, you will naturally enjoy doing things the way they should be done.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_4">14:5.4</a></small></sup>  When intelligent beings first attain the central universe, they are received and domiciled on the pilot world of the seventh Havona circuit. As the new arrivals progress spiritually, attain identity comprehension of their superuniverse <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Master Spirit</a>, they are transferred to the sixth circle. (It is from these arrangements in the central universe that the circles of progress in the human mind have been designated.) After <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> have attained a realization of <a href="/en/topic/Supremacy">Supremacy</a> and are thereby prepared for the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> adventure, they are taken to the fifth circuit; and after attaining the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, they are transferred to the fourth. Following the attainment of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, they are removed to the third; and when they have recognized the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, they go to sojourn on the second circuit of worlds, where they become more familiar with the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> hosts. Arrival on <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> circuit of Havona signifies the acceptance of the candidates of time into the service of Paradise. Indefinitely, according to the length and nature of the creature ascension, they will tarry on the inner circuit of progressive spiritual attainment. From this inner circuit the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> pass inward to Paradise residence and admission to the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_5">14:5.5</a></small></sup>  During your sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> as a pilgrim of ascent, you will be allowed to visit freely among the worlds of the circuit of your assignment. You will also be permitted to go back to the planets of those circuits you have previously traversed. And all this is possible to those who sojourn on the circles of Havona without the necessity of being ensupernaphimed. The pilgrims of time are able to equip themselves to traverse “achieved” <a href="/en/topic/space">space</a> but must depend on the ordained technique to negotiate “unachieved” space; a pilgrim cannot leave Havona nor go forward beyond his assigned circuit without the aid of a <a href="/en/topic/transport_supernaphim">transport supernaphim</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_6">14:5.6</a></small></sup>  There is a refreshing originality about this vast central creation. Aside from the physical organization of matter and the fundamental constitution of the basic orders of intelligent beings and other living things, there is nothing in common between the worlds of Havona. Every one of these planets is an original, unique, and exclusive creation; each planet is a matchless, superb, and perfect production. And this diversity of individuality extends to all features of the physical, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of planetary existence. Each of these billion perfection spheres has been developed and embellished in accordance with the plans of the resident Eternal of Days. And this is just why no two of them are alike.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_7">14:5.7</a></small></sup>  Not until you traverse <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> circuits and visit the last of the Havona worlds, will the tonic of adventure and the stimulus of <a href="/en/topic/curiosity">curiosity</a> disappear from your career. And then will the urge, the forward impulse of eternity, replace its forerunner, the adventure lure of time.</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_8">14:5.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/boredom">Monotony</a> is indicative of immaturity of the creative imagination and inactivity of intellectual co-ordination with the spiritual endowment. By the time an ascendant mortal begins the exploration of these heavenly worlds, he has already attained emotional, intellectual, and social, if not spiritual, maturity.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_9">14:5.9</a></small></sup>  Not only will you find undreamed-of changes confronting you as you advance from circuit to circuit in <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, but your astonishment will be inexpressible as you progress from planet to planet within each circuit. Each of these billion study worlds is a veritable university of surprises. Continuing astonishment, unending wonder, is the experience of those who traverse these circuits and tour these gigantic spheres. Monotony is not a part of the Havona career.</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_10">14:5.10</a></small></sup>  Love of <a href="/en/topic/adventure">adventure</a>, <a href="/en/topic/curiosity">curiosity</a>, and dread of monotony—these traits inherent in evolving human nature—were not put there just to aggravate and annoy you during your short sojourn on earth, but rather to suggest to you that <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> is only the beginning of an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery.</p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_11">14:5.11</a></small></sup>  Curiosity—the spirit of investigation, the urge of discovery, the drive of exploration—is a part of the inborn and divine endowment of evolutionary space creatures. These natural impulses were not given you merely to be frustrated and repressed. True, these ambitious urges must frequently be restrained during your short life on earth, disappointment must be often experienced, but they are to be fully realized and gloriously gratified during the long ages to come.</p>

It is possible that the central universe serves many purposes which are not revealed to me, as it functions in numerous ways beyond the comprehension of the created mind.

<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_9">14:6.9</a></small></sup>  Our Father beholds the central universe with perfect pleasure because it is a worthy revelation of spirit reality to all personalities of the universe of universes.</p>
<p id="p6_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_10">14:6.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of universes has favorable regard for <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> as the eternal power nucleus for all subsequent universe expansion in time and space.</p>
<p id="p6_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_11">14:6.11</a></small></sup>  The eternal Father views with never-ending satisfaction the Havona creation as the worthy and alluring goal for the ascension candidates of time, his mortal grandchildren of space achieving their Creator-Father’s eternal home.

It will probably be the finishing school when the seven superuniverses are functioning as the intermediate school for the graduates of the primary schools of outer space. And we incline to the opinion that the potentials of eternal Havona are really unlimited, that the central universe has eternal capacity to serve as an experiential training universe for all past, present, or future types of created beings.</p>
