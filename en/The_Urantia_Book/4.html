<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_1">4:1.1</a></small></sup>  For ages the inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> have misunderstood the <a href="/en/topic/providence">providence</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. There is a providence of divine outworking on your world, but it is not the childish, arbitrary, and material ministry many <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> have conceived it to be. The providence of God consists in the interlocking activities of the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> and the divine spirits who, in accordance with cosmic law, unceasingly labor for the honor of God and for the spiritual advancement of his <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a> children.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_2">4:1.2</a></small></sup>  Can you not advance in your concept of God’s dealing with man to that level where you recognize that the watchword of the universe is <i><a href="/en/topic/progress">progress</a>?</i> Through long ages the human race has struggled to reach its present position. Throughout all these millenniums Providence has been working out the plan of progressive <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a>. The two thoughts are not opposed in practice, only in man’s mistaken concepts. Divine providence is never arrayed in opposition to true human progress, either temporal or spiritual.

<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_7">4:1.7</a></small></sup>  A being of my order is able to discover ultimate harmony and to detect far-reaching and profound co-ordination in the routine affairs of universe administration. Much that seems disjointed and haphazard to the mortal mind appears orderly and constructive to my understanding. But there is very much going on in the universes that I do not fully comprehend. I have long been a student of, and am more or less conversant with, the recognized forces, energies, minds, morontias, spirits, and personalities of the local universes and the superuniverses. I have a general understanding of how these agencies and personalities operate, and I am intimately familiar with the workings of the accredited spirit intelligences of the grand universe. Notwithstanding my knowledge of the phenomena of the universes, I am constantly confronted with cosmic reactions which I cannot fully fathom. I am continually encountering apparently fortuitous conspiracies of the interassociation of forces, energies, intellects, and spirits, which I cannot satisfactorily explain.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_8">4:1.8</a></small></sup>  I am entirely competent to trace out and to analyze the working of all phenomena directly resulting from the functioning of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, and, to a large extent, the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>. My perplexity is occasioned by encountering what appears to be the performance of their mysterious co-ordinates, the three <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a> of potentiality. These Absolutes seem to supersede <a href="/en/topic/matter">matter</a>, to transcend <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a>, and to supervene <a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a>. I am constantly confused and often perplexed by my inability to comprehend these complex transactions which I attribute to the presences and performances of the <a href="/en/topic/Unqualified_Absolute">Unqualified Absolute</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Deity_Absolute">Deity Absolute</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Absolute">Universal Absolute</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_9">4:1.9</a></small></sup>  These Absolutes must be the not-fully-revealed presences abroad in the <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a> which, in the phenomena of <a href="/en/topic/absoluta">space potency</a> and in the function of other superultimates, render it impossible for physicists, philosophers, or even religionists to predict with certainty as to just how the primordials of force, concept, or spirit will respond to demands made in a complex reality situation involving supreme adjustments and ultimate values.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_10">4:1.10</a></small></sup>  There is also an organic <a href="/en/topic/unity">unity</a> in the universes of time and space which seems to underlie the whole fabric of cosmic events. This living presence of the evolving <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being, this <a href="/en/topic/Immanence_of_the_Projected_Incomplete">Immanence of the Projected Incomplete</a>, is inexplicably manifested ever and anon by what appears to be an amazingly fortuitous co-ordination of apparently unrelated universe happenings. This must be the function of Providence—the realm of the Supreme Being and the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_11">4:1.11</a></small></sup>  I am inclined to believe that it is this far-flung and generally unrecognizable control of the co-ordination and interassociation of all phases and forms of <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a> activity that causes such a variegated and apparently hopelessly confused medley of physical, mental, moral, and spiritual phenomena so unerringly to work out to the glory of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and for the <a href="/en/topic/good">good</a> of men and <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_12">4:1.12</a></small></sup>  But in the larger sense the apparent “accidents” of the cosmos are undoubtedly a part of the finite drama of the time-space adventure of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> in his eternal manipulation of the <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. GOD AND NATURE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_1">4:2.1</a></small></sup>  Nature is in a limited sense the physical habit of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. The conduct, or action, of God is qualified and provisionally modified by the experimental plans and the evolutionary patterns of a local <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>, a constellation, a system, or a planet. God acts in accordance with a well-defined, unchanging, immutable <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> throughout the wide-spreading master universe; but he modifies the patterns of his action so as to contribute to the co-ordinate and balanced conduct of each universe, constellation, system, planet, and personality in accordance with the local objects, aims, and plans of the finite projects of evolutionary unfolding.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_2">4:2.2</a></small></sup>  Therefore, <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a>, as mortal man understands it, presents the underlying foundation and fundamental background of a changeless <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> and his immutable laws, modified by, fluctuating because of, and experiencing upheavals through, the working of the local plans, purposes, patterns, and conditions which have been inaugurated and are being carried out by the local universe, constellation, system, and planetary forces and personalities. For example: As God’s laws have been ordained in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, they are modified by the plans established by the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and Creative Spirit of this local universe; and in addition to all this the operation of these laws has been further influenced by the errors, defaults, and insurrections of certain beings resident upon your planet and belonging to your immediate planetary system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_3">4:2.3</a></small></sup>  Nature is a time-space resultant of two cosmic factors: first, the immutability, perfection, and rectitude of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Deity, and second, the experimental plans, executive blunders, insurrectionary errors, incompleteness of development, and imperfection of wisdom of the extra-Paradise creatures, from the highest to the lowest. Nature therefore carries a uniform, unchanging, majestic, and marvelous thread of perfection from the circle of eternity; but in each <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>, on each planet, and in each individual life, this nature is modified, qualified, and perchance marred by the acts, the mistakes, and the disloyalties of the creatures of the evolutionary systems and universes; and therefore must nature ever be of a changing mood, whimsical withal, though stable underneath, and varied in accordance with the operating procedures of a local universe.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_4">4:2.4</a></small></sup>  Nature is the perfection of Paradise divided by the incompletion, evil, and sin of the unfinished universes. This quotient is thus expressive of both the perfect and the partial, of both the eternal and the temporal. Continuing <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> modifies <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a> by augmenting the content of Paradise perfection and by diminishing the content of the evil, error, and disharmony of relative reality.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_5">4:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is not personally present in nature or in any of the forces of nature, for the phenomenon of nature is the superimposition of the imperfections of progressive evolution and, sometimes, the consequences of insurrectionary rebellion, upon the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> foundations of God’s universal <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a>. As it appears on such a world as <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, nature can never be the adequate expression, the true representation, the faithful portrayal, of an all-wise and infinite God.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_6">4:2.6</a></small></sup>  Nature, on your world, is a qualification of the laws of perfection by the evolutionary plans of the local <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>. What a travesty to <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a> because it is in a limited, qualified sense pervaded by God; because it is a phase of the universal and, therefore, divine power! Nature also is a manifestation of the unfinished, the incomplete, the imperfect outworkings of the development, growth, and progress of a universe experiment in cosmic evolution.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_7">4:2.7</a></small></sup>  The apparent defects of the natural world are not indicative of any such corresponding defects in the character of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Rather are such observed imperfections merely the inevitable stop-moments in the exhibition of the ever-moving reel of infinity picturization. It is these very defect-interruptions of perfection-continuity which make it possible for the finite mind of material man to catch a fleeting glimpse of divine <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a> in time and space. The material manifestations of divinity appear defective to the evolutionary mind of man only because mortal man persists in viewing the phenomena of nature through natural eyes, human vision unaided by morontia <a href="/en/topic/mota">mota</a> or by <a href="/en/topic/revelation">revelation</a>, its compensatory substitute on the worlds of time.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_8">4:2.8</a></small></sup>  And <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a> is marred, her beautiful face is scarred, her features are seared, by the rebellion, the misconduct, the misthinking of the myriads of creatures who are a part of nature, but who have contributed to her disfigurement in time. No, nature is not God. Nature is not an object of <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a>.</p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p3_3">4:3.3</a></small></sup>  Much, very much, of the difficulty which <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> have in understanding <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is due to the far-reaching consequences of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> betrayal. On worlds not segregated by sin, the evolutionary races are able to formulate far better ideas of the Universal Father; they suffer less from <a href="/en/topic/confusion">confusion</a>, distortion, and perversion of concept.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p3_4">4:3.4</a></small></sup>  God repents of nothing he has ever done, now does, or ever will do<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>. He is all-wise as well as all-powerful. Man’s <a href="/en/topic/wisdom">wisdom</a> grows out of the trials and errors of human experience; God’s wisdom consists in the unqualified perfection of his infinite <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a> insight, and this divine foreknowledge effectively directs the creative free will.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p3_5">4:3.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> never does anything that causes subsequent sorrow or regret, but the will creatures of the planning and making of his Creator personalities in the outlying universes, by their unfortunate choosing, sometimes occasion emotions of divine sorrow in the personalities of their Creator parents. But though the Father neither makes <a href="/en/topic/mistakes">mistakes</a>, harbors regrets, nor experiences sorrows, he is a being with a father’s affection, and his heart is undoubtedly grieved when his children fail to attain the spiritual levels they are capable of reaching with the assistance which has been so freely provided by the spiritual-attainment plans and the mortal-ascension policies of the universes.</p>

God is purposive energy (creative spirit) and absolute will, and these are self-existent and universal.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_2">4:4.2</a></small></sup>  Since God is self-existent, he is absolutely independent. The very identity of God is inimical to change. “I, the Lord, change not<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.” God is immutable; but not until you achieve <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> status can you even begin to understand how God can pass from simplicity to complexity, from identity to variation, from quiescence to motion, from infinity to finitude, from the divine to the human, and from unity to duality and triunity. And God can thus modify the manifestations of his absoluteness because divine immutability does not imply immobility; God has will—he <i>is</i> will.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_3">4:4.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is the being of absolute self-determination; there are no limits to his <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a> reactions save those which are self-imposed, and his freewill acts are conditioned only by those divine qualities and perfect attributes which inherently characterize his eternal nature. Therefore is God related to the universe as the being of final goodness plus a free will of creative infinity.</p>

Personality, goodness, and numerous other characteristics, God shares with man and other beings, but infinity of will is his alone. God is limited in his creative acts only by the sentiments of his eternal nature and by the dictates of his infinite wisdom. God personally chooses only that which is infinitely perfect, hence the supernal perfection of the central universe; and while the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> fully share his divinity, even phases of his absoluteness, they are not altogether limited by that finality of wisdom which directs the Father’s infinity of will. Hence, in the <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> order of sonship, creative free will becomes even more active, wholly divine and well-nigh ultimate, if not absolute. The Father is infinite and eternal, but to deny the possibility of his volitional self-limitation amounts to a denial of this very concept of his volitional absoluteness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
