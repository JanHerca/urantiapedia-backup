The morose emperor was unusually cheerful on this day and chatted long with the trio.

His father had much business to transact, and desiring that his son grow up to become a worthy successor in the management of his vast commercial interests, he thought the time had come to introduce the boy to the business world. There were many citizens of India in Rome, and often one of Gonod‚Äôs own employees would accompany him as interpreter so that Jesus would have whole days to himself; this gave him time in which to become thoroughly acquainted with this city of two million inhabitants. He was frequently to be found in the <a href="/en/topic/forum">forum</a>, the center of political, legal, and business life. He often went up to the <a href="/en/topic/Capitolium">Capitolium</a> and pondered the bondage of ignorance in which these <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> were held as he beheld this magnificent <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> dedicated to <a href="/en/topic/Jupiter_(god)">Jupiter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Juno">Juno</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Minerva">Minerva</a>.

His desire to study and mingle with this cosmopolitan aggregation of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> was the chief reason why <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> consented to make this journey.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_27"><a href="#fn_a0_3_27">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4">132:0.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus learned much about men while in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, but the most valuable of all the manifold experiences of his six months‚Äô sojourn in that city was his contact with, and influence upon, the religious leaders of the empire‚Äôs capital. Before the end of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> week in Rome Jesus had sought out, and had made the acquaintance of, the worth-while leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Cynics">Cynics</a>, the Stoics, and the mystery cults, in particular the Mithraic group. Whether or not it was apparent to Jesus that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were going to reject his mission, he most certainly foresaw that his <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> were presently coming to Rome to proclaim the kingdom of heaven; and he therefore set about, in the most amazing manner, to prepare the way for the better and more certain reception of their message. He selected five of the leading Stoics, eleven of the Cynics, and sixteen of the mystery-cult leaders and spent much of his spare time for almost six months in intimate association with these religious teachers. And this was his method of instruction: Never once did he attack their errors or even mention the flaws in their teachings. In each case he would select the <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> in what they taught and then proceed so to embellish and illuminate this truth in their minds that in a very short time this enhancement of the truth effectively crowded out the associated <a href="/en/topic/error">error</a>; and thus were these Jesus-taught men and women prepared for the subsequent recognition of additional and similar truths in the teachings of the early Christian missionaries. It was this early acceptance of the teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> preachers which gave that powerful impetus to the rapid spread of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> in Rome and from there throughout the empire.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_4_11"><a href="#fn_a0_4_11">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_12"><a href="#fn_a0_4_12">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_22"><a href="#fn_a0_4_22">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_38"><a href="#fn_a0_4_38">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_45"><a href="#fn_a0_4_45">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p5_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_15">132:5.15</a></small></sup>  ‚Äú1. As steward of inherited <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a> you should consider its sources. You are under moral obligation to represent the past generation in the honest transmittal of legitimate wealth to succeeding generations after subtracting a fair toll for the benefit of the present generation. But you are not obligated to perpetuate any dishonesty or injustice involved in the unfair accumulation of wealth by your ancestors. Any portion of your inherited wealth which turns out to have been derived through fraud or unfairness, you may disburse in accordance with your convictions of justice, generosity, and restitution. The remainder of your legitimate inherited wealth you may use in equity and transmit in security as the trustee of one generation for another.

Everyone who enjoys wealth as a result of discovery should remember that one individual can live on earth but a short season and should, therefore, make adequate provision for the sharing of these <a href="/en/topic/discoveries">discoveries</a> in helpful ways by the largest possible number of his fellow men. While the discoverer should not be denied all reward for efforts of discovery, neither should he selfishly presume to lay claim to all of the advantages and blessings to be derived from the uncovering of nature‚Äôs hoarded resources.</p>
<p id="p5_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_17">132:5.17</a></small></sup>  ‚Äú3.

Every tradesman deserves wages for his services; the merchant is entitled to his hire. The fairness of trade and the honest treatment accorded one‚Äôs fellows in the organized business of the world create many different sorts of profit <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a>, and all these sources of wealth must be judged by the highest principles of justice, honesty, and fairness. The honest trader should not hesitate to take the same profit which he would gladly accord his fellow trader in a similar transaction. While this sort of wealth is not identical with individually earned income when business dealings are conducted on a large scale, at the same time, such honestly accumulated wealth endows its possessor with a considerable equity as regards a voice in its subsequent distribution.</p>

No noble man will strive to accumulate riches and amass wealth-power by the enslavement or unfair <a href="/en/topic/exploitation">exploitation</a> of his brothers in the flesh. Riches are a moral curse and a spiritual stigma when they are derived from the sweat of oppressed mortal man.

It would be equally unjust to deprive the genius of all his increment of wealth. And it will ever be impossible for men to establish rules and regulations applicable equally to all these problems of the equitable distribution of wealth. You must first recognize man as your brother, and if you honestly desire to do by him as you would have him do by you, the commonplace dictates of justice, honesty, and fairness will guide you in the just and impartial settlement of every recurring problem of economic rewards and social justice.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_20_32"><a href="#fn_a5_20_32">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_20_33"><a href="#fn_a5_20_33">[35]</a></sup></p>

Accidental riches should be regarded somewhat in the light of a trust to be expended for the benefit of one‚Äôs social or economic group. The possessors of such wealth should be accorded the major voice in the determination of the wise and effective distribution of such unearned resources.

Man must become hungry for truth as a result of the experiences of living, or he must desire to know God as the result of contact with the lives of those who are acquainted with the divine Father before another human being can act as the means of leading such a fellow mortal to the Father in heaven. If we know God, our real business on earth is so to live as to permit the Father to reveal himself in our lives, and thus will all God-seeking persons see the Father and ask for our help in finding out more about the God who in this manner finds expression in our lives.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_2_8"><a href="#fn_a7_2_8">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_45"><a href="#fn_a7_2_45">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_25"><a href="#fn_a7_2_25">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_3"><a href="#fn_a7_2_3">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_20"><a href="#fn_a7_2_20">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_39"><a href="#fn_a7_2_39">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_46"><a href="#fn_a7_2_46">[42]</a></sup></p>
