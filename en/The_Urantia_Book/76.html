<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p1_1">76:1.1</a></small></sup>  It required almost a full year for the caravan of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> to reach the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates River</a>. Finding it in flood tide, they remained camped on the plains west of the stream almost six weeks before they made their way across to the land between the rivers which was to become the <a href="/en/topic/second_garden">second garden</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p1_2">76:1.2</a></small></sup>  When word had reached the dwellers in the land of the second garden that the king and high priest of the Garden of Eden was marching on them, they had fled in haste to the eastern mountains. Adam found all of the desired territory vacated when he arrived. And here in this new location Adam and his helpers set themselves to work to build new homes and establish a new center of culture and religion.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p1_3">76:1.3</a></small></sup>  This site was known to <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> as one of the three original selections of the committee assigned to choose possible locations for the Garden proposed by <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Amadon">Amadon</a>.

Nature was once again taking its course. Now were the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> compelled to wrest a living from unprepared soil and to cope with the realities of life in the face of the natural hostilities and incompatibilities of mortal existence. They found <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> garden partially prepared for them, but the second had to be created by the labor of their own hands and in the ‚Äúsweat of their faces<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_1">76:2.1</a></small></sup>  Less than two years after <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a>‚Äôs birth, <a href="/en/topic/Abel">Abel</a> was born, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> child of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> to be born in the <a href="/en/topic/second_garden">second garden</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. When Abel grew up to the age of twelve years, he elected to be a herder; Cain had chosen to follow agriculture.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_2">76:2.2</a></small></sup>  Now, in those days it was customary to make offerings to the priesthood of the things at hand<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. Herders would bring of their flocks, farmers of the fruits of the fields; and in accordance with this custom, Cain and Abel likewise made periodic offerings to the priests. The two boys had many times argued about the relative merits of their vocations, and Abel was not slow to note that preference was shown for his animal sacrifices. In vain did Cain appeal to the traditions of the first Eden, to the former preference for the fruits of the fields. But this Abel would not allow, and he taunted his older brother in his discomfiture.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_3">76:2.3</a></small></sup>  In the days of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> Eden, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> had indeed sought to discourage the offering of animal <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> so that <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a> had a justifiable precedent for his contentions. It was, however, difficult to organize the religious life of the second Eden. <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> was burdened with a thousand and one details associated with the work of building, defense, and agriculture. Being much depressed spiritually, he intrusted the organization of worship and education to those of Nodite extraction who had served in these capacities in the first <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>; and in even so short a time the officiating Nodite priests were reverting to the standards and rulings of pre-Adamic times.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_4">76:2.4</a></small></sup>  The two boys never got along well, and this matter of sacrifices further contributed to the growing hatred between them. <a href="/en/topic/Abel">Abel</a> knew he was the son of both Adam and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> and never failed to impress upon Cain that Adam was not his father. Cain was not pure violet as his father was of the Nodite race later admixed with the blue and the red man and with the aboriginal Andonic stock. And all of this, with Cain‚Äôs natural bellicose inheritance, caused him to nourish an ever-increasing hatred for his younger brother.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_5">76:2.5</a></small></sup>  The boys were respectively eighteen and twenty years of age when the tension between them was finally resolved, one day, when Abel‚Äôs taunts so infuriated his bellicose brother that <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a> turned upon him in wrath and slew him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_6">76:2.6</a></small></sup>  The observation of <a href="/en/topic/Abel">Abel</a>‚Äôs conduct establishes the value of environment and <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> as factors in <a href="/en/topic/character">character</a> development. Abel had an ideal inheritance, and heredity lies at the bottom of all character; but the influence of an inferior environment virtually neutralized this magnificent inheritance. Abel, especially during his younger years, was greatly influenced by his unfavorable surroundings. He would have become an entirely different person had he lived to be twenty-five or thirty; his superb inheritance would then have shown itself. While a good environment cannot contribute much toward really overcoming the character handicaps of a base heredity, a bad environment can very effectively spoil an excellent inheritance, at least during the younger years of life. Good social environment and proper education are indispensable soil and atmosphere for getting the most out of a good inheritance.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_7">76:2.7</a></small></sup>  The death of Abel became known to his parents when his <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dogs</a> brought the flocks home without their master. To <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a> was fast becoming the grim reminder of their folly, and they encouraged him in his decision to leave the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_8">76:2.8</a></small></sup>  Cain‚Äôs life in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> had not been exactly happy since he was in such a peculiar way symbolic of the default. It was not that his associates were unkind to him, but he had not been unaware of their subconscious resentment of his presence. But Cain knew that, since he bore no <a href="/en/topic/tribal_mark">tribal mark</a>, he would be killed by <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> neighboring tribesmen who might chance to meet him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/fear">Fear</a>, and some remorse, led him to repent. Cain had never been indwelt by an Adjuster, had always been defiant of the family discipline and disdainful of his father‚Äôs religion. But he now went to Eve, his mother, and asked for spiritual help and guidance, and when he honestly sought divine assistance, an Adjuster indwelt him. And this Adjuster, dwelling within and looking out, gave Cain a distinct advantage of superiority which classed him with the greatly feared tribe of Adam<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_9">76:2.9</a></small></sup>  And so <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a> departed for the land of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(land_of)">Nod</a>, east of the second Eden<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. He became a great leader among one group of his father‚Äôs people and did, to a certain degree, fulfill the predictions of <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a>, for he did promote peace between this division of the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> throughout his lifetime. Cain married <a href="/en/topic/Remona">Remona</a>, his distant cousin, and their first son, <a href="/en/topic/Enoch">Enoch</a>, became the head of the Elamite Nodites<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.

<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. LIFE IN MESOPOTAMIA </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_1">76:3.1</a></small></sup>  As time passed in the <a href="/en/topic/second_garden">second garden</a>, the consequences of default became increasingly apparent. <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> greatly missed their former home of beauty and tranquillity as well as their children who had been deported to <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>. It was indeed pathetic to observe this magnificent couple reduced to the status of the common flesh of the realm; but they bore their diminished estate with grace and fortitude.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_2">76:3.2</a></small></sup>  Adam wisely spent most of the time training his children and their associates in civil administration, educational methods, and religious devotions. Had it not been for this foresight, pandemonium would have broken loose upon his death. As it was, the death of Adam made little difference in the conduct of the affairs of his people. But long before Adam and Eve passed away, they recognized that their children and followers had gradually learned to forget the days of their glory in Eden. And it was better for the majority of their followers that they did forget the grandeur of Eden; they were not so likely to experience undue dissatisfaction with their less fortunate environment.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_3">76:3.3</a></small></sup>  The civil rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> were derived hereditarily from the sons of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>‚Äôs first son, <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a> (<a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> ben <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a>), founded a secondary center of the violet race to the north of the second Eden. Adam‚Äôs second son, <a href="/en/topic/Eveson">Eveson</a>, became a masterly leader and administrator; he was the great helper of his father. Eveson lived not quite so long as Adam, and his eldest son, <a href="/en/topic/Jansad">Jansad</a>, became the successor of Adam as the head of the Adamite tribes.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_4">76:3.4</a></small></sup>  The religious rulers, or priesthood, originated with <a href="/en/topic/Seth">Seth</a>, the eldest surviving son of Adam and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> born in the <a href="/en/topic/second_garden">second garden</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. He was born one hundred and twenty-nine years after Adam‚Äôs arrival on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Seth became absorbed in the work of improving the spiritual status of his father‚Äôs people, becoming the head of the new priesthood of the second garden. His son, <a href="/en/topic/Enos">Enos</a>, founded the new order of worship, and his grandson, <a href="/en/topic/Kenan">Kenan</a>, instituted the foreign missionary service to the surrounding tribes, near and far<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_5">76:3.5</a></small></sup>  The Sethite priesthood was a threefold undertaking, embracing religion, health, and education. The priests of this order were trained to officiate at religious ceremonies, to serve as physicians and sanitary inspectors, and to act as teachers in the schools of the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_6">76:3.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>‚Äôs caravan had carried the seeds and bulbs of hundreds of plants and cereals of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> garden with them to the land between the rivers; they also had brought along extensive herds and some of all the domesticated animals. Because of this they possessed great advantages over the surrounding tribes. They enjoyed many of the benefits of the previous culture of the original Garden.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_7">76:3.7</a></small></sup>  Up to the time of leaving the first <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, Adam and his family had always subsisted on fruits, cereals, and nuts. On the way to <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> they had, for the first time, partaken of herbs and vegetables. The eating of meat was early introduced into the <a href="/en/topic/second_garden">second garden</a>, but Adam and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> never partook of flesh as a part of their regular diet. Neither did <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a> nor <a href="/en/topic/Eveson">Eveson</a> nor the other children of the first generation of the first garden become flesh eaters.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_8">76:3.8</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> greatly excelled the surrounding peoples in cultural achievement and intellectual development. They produced the third alphabet and otherwise laid the foundations for much that was the forerunner of modern art, science, and literature. Here in the lands between the <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> they maintained the arts of <a href="/en/topic/writing">writing</a>, <a href="/en/topic/metalworking">metalworking</a>, <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> making, and <a href="/en/topic/weaving">weaving</a> and produced a type of architecture that was not excelled in thousands of years.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_9">76:3.9</a></small></sup>  The home life of the violet peoples was, for their day and age, ideal.

They fully believed this <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of resurrection and rehabilitation which the Melchizedeks so touchingly proclaimed to them. Their transgression had been an <a href="/en/topic/error">error</a> of judgment and not the sin of conscious and deliberate rebellion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup></p>

But shortly after their reduction to mortal status they became conscious of a new presence within them and awakened to the realization that human status coupled with sincere repentance had made it possible for Adjusters to indwell them. It was this knowledge of being Adjuster indwelt that greatly heartened Adam and Eve throughout the remainder of their lives; they knew that they had failed as <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, but they also knew that the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> career was still open to them as ascending sons of the universe.</p>

This message, among other expressions of friendship and comfort, said: ‚ÄúI have given consideration to the circumstances of your default, I have remembered the desire of your hearts ever to be loyal to my Father‚Äôs will, and you will be called from the embrace of mortal slumber when I come to Urantia if the subordinate Sons of my realm do not send for you before that time.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p5_4">76:5.4</a></small></sup>  And this was a great mystery to Adam and Eve. They could comprehend the veiled promise of a possible special resurrection in this message, and such a possibility greatly cheered them, but they could not grasp the meaning of the intimation that they might rest until the time of a resurrection associated with Michael‚Äôs personal appearance on Urantia. And so the Edenic pair always proclaimed that a <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a> would sometime come, and they communicated to their loved ones the belief, at least the longing hope, that the world of their blunders and sorrows might possibly be the realm whereon the ruler of this universe would elect to function as the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> bestowal Son. It seemed too good to be true, but Adam did entertain the thought that strife-torn Urantia might, after all, turn out to be the most fortunate world in the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, the envied planet of all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a17"><a href="#fn_a17">[17]</a></sup></p>
