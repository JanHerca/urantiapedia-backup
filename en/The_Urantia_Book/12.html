<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p0_1">12:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE immensity of the far-flung creation of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> is utterly beyond the grasp of finite imagination; the enormousness of the <a href="/en/topic/master_universe">master universe</a> staggers the concept of even my order of being. But the mortal mind can be taught much about the plan and arrangement of the universes; you can know something of their physical organization and marvelous administration; you may learn much about the various groups of intelligent beings who inhabit the seven superuniverses of time and the central universe of eternity.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p0_2">12:0.2</a></small></sup>  In principle, that is, in eternal potential, we conceive of material creation as being infinite because the Universal Father is actually infinite, but as we study and observe the total material creation, we know that at any given moment in time it is limited, although to your finite minds it is comparatively limitless, virtually boundless.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p0_3">12:0.3</a></small></sup>  We are convinced, from the study of physical law and from the observation of the starry realms, that the infinite Creator is not yet manifest in finality of cosmic expression, that much of the cosmic potential of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> is still self-contained and unrevealed. To created beings the <a href="/en/topic/master_universe">master universe</a> might appear to be almost infinite, but it is far from finished; there are still physical limits to the material creation, and the experiential revelation of the eternal purpose is still in progress.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_1">12:1.1</a></small></sup>  The universe of universes is not an infinite plane, a boundless cube, nor a limitless circle; it certainly has dimensions. The laws of physical organization and administration prove conclusively that the whole vast aggregation of force-energy and matter-power functions ultimately as a space unit, as an organized and co-ordinated whole. The observable behavior of the material creation constitutes evidence of a physical universe of definite limits. The final proof of both a circular and delimited universe is afforded by the, to us, well-known fact that all forms of basic <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a> ever swing around the curved path of the space levels of the <a href="/en/topic/master_universe">master universe</a> in obedience to the incessant and absolute pull of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_gravity">Paradise gravity</a>.</p>

If the master universe were not a series of elliptical space levels of lessened resistance to motion, alternating with zones of relative quiescence, we conceive that some of the cosmic energies would be observed to shoot off on an infinite range, off on a straight-line path into trackless space; but we never find force, energy, or matter thus behaving; ever they whirl, always swinging onward in the tracks of the great space circuits.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>

This never-beginning, never-ending universe consists of one billion spheres of sublime perfection and is surrounded by the enormous <a href="/en/topic/dark_gravity_bodies">dark gravity bodies</a>. At the center of Havona is the stationary and absolutely stabilized <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>, surrounded by its twenty-one satellites. Owing to the enormous encircling masses of the dark gravity bodies about the fringe of the central universe, the mass content of this central creation is far in excess of the total known mass of all seven sectors of the grand universe.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_11">12:1.11</a></small></sup>  <i>The Paradise-Havona System,</i> the eternal universe encircling the eternal Isle, constitutes the perfect and eternal nucleus of the <a href="/en/topic/master_universe">master universe</a>; all seven of the superuniverses and all regions of outer space revolve in established orbits around the gigantic central aggregation of the Paradise satellites and the Havona spheres.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_12">12:1.12</a></small></sup>  <i>The Seven Superuniverses</i> are not primary physical organizations; nowhere do their boundaries divide a nebular family, neither do they cross a local universe, a prime creative unit. Each superuniverse is simply a geographic space clustering of approximately one seventh of the organized and partially inhabited post-Havona creation, and each is about equal in the number of local universes embraced and in the space encompassed. <i><a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>,</i> your local universe, is one of the newer creations in <i><a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>,</i> the seventh superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13">12:1.13</a></small></sup>  <i>The Grand Universe</i> is the present organized and inhabited creation. It consists of the seven <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a>, with an aggregate evolutionary potential of around seven trillion inhabited planets, not to mention the eternal spheres of the central creation. But this tentative estimate takes no account of architectural administrative spheres, neither does it include the outlying groups of unorganized universes. The present ragged edge of the <a href="/en/topic/grand_universe">grand universe</a>, its uneven and unfinished periphery, together with the tremendously unsettled condition of the whole astronomical plot, suggests to our star students that even the seven superuniverses are, as yet, uncompleted. As we move from within, from the divine center outward in any one direction, we do, eventually, come to the outer limits of the organized and inhabited creation; we come to the outer limits of the grand universe. And it is near this outer border, in a far-off corner of such a magnificent creation, that your local universe has its eventful existence.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14">12:1.14</a></small></sup>  <i>The Outer Space Levels.</i> Far out in space, at an enormous distance from the seven inhabited superuniverses, there are assembling vast and unbelievably stupendous circuits of force and materializing energies. Between the energy circuits of the seven superuniverses and this gigantic outer belt of force activity, there is a space zone of comparative quiet, which varies in width but averages about four hundred thousand <a href="/en/topic/light-years">light-years</a>. These space zones are free from star dust—cosmic fog. Our students of these phenomena are in doubt as to the exact status of the space-forces existing in this zone of relative quiet which encircles the seven superuniverses. But about one-half million light-years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe we observe the beginnings of a zone of an unbelievable energy action which increases in volume and intensity for over twenty-five million light-years. These tremendous wheels of energizing forces are situated in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> outer space level, a continuous belt of cosmic activity encircling the whole of the known, organized, and inhabited creation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>

And there are those who maintain that the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> can never attain full expression short of infinity; and therefore do they postulate an additional and unrevealed creation beyond the fourth and outermost space level, a possible ever-expanding, never-ending universe of infinity. In theory we do not know how to limit either the infinity of the Creator or the potential infinity of creation, but as it exists and is administered, we regard the master universe as having limitations, as being definitely delimited and bounded on its outer margins by open space.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_1">12:2.1</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> astronomers peer through their increasingly powerful telescopes into the mysterious stretches of outer space and there behold the amazing evolution of almost countless physical universes, they should realize that they are gazing upon the mighty outworking of the unsearchable plans of the <a href="/en/topic/Architects_of_the_Master_Universe">Architects of the Master Universe</a>. True, we do possess evidences which are suggestive of the presence of certain <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> personality influences here and there throughout the vast energy manifestations now characteristic of these outer regions, but from the larger viewpoint the space regions extending beyond the outer borders of the seven superuniverses are generally recognized as constituting the domains of the <a href="/en/topic/Unqualified_Absolute">Unqualified Absolute</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_2">12:2.2</a></small></sup>  Although the unaided human eye can see only two or three nebulae outside the borders of the superuniverse of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>, your <a href="/en/topic/telescopes">telescopes</a> literally reveal millions upon millions of these physical universes in process of formation. Most of the starry realms visually exposed to the search of your present-day telescopes are in <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(Paradise_satellite)">Orvonton</a>, but with photographic technique the larger telescopes penetrate far beyond the borders of the grand universe into the domains of outer space, where untold universes are in process of organization.

The physicists of Uversa calculate that the energy and matter of these outer and uncharted regions already equal many times the total material mass and energy charge embraced in all seven superuniverses. We are informed that the metamorphosis of <a href="/en/topic/absoluta">cosmic force</a> in these outer <a href="/en/topic/space_levels">space levels</a> is a function of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_force_organizers">Paradise force organizers</a>. We also know that these forces are ancestral to those physical energies which at present activate the grand universe. The <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a> power directors, however, have nothing to do with these far-distant realms, neither are the energy movements therein discernibly connected with the power circuits of the organized and inhabited creations.</p>

<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_7">12:3.7</a></small></sup>  In this connection it is interesting to record certain observations made on <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> during recent millenniums by the corps of gravity researchers. This expert group of workers has arrived at the following conclusions regarding the different gravity systems of the <a href="/en/topic/master_universe">master universe</a>:</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_8">12:3.8</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Physical Gravity.</i> Having formulated an estimate of the summation of the entire physical-gravity capacity of the <a href="/en/topic/grand_universe">grand universe</a>, they have laboriously effected a comparison of this finding with the estimated total of absolute <a href="/en/topic/gravity">gravity</a> presence now operative. These calculations indicate that the total gravity action on the grand universe is a very small part of the estimated gravity pull of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, computed on the basis of the gravity response of basic physical units of universe matter. These investigators reach the amazing conclusion that the central universe and the surrounding seven superuniverses are at the present time making use of only about five per cent of the active functioning of the Paradise absolute-gravity grasp. In other words: At the present moment about ninety-five per cent of the active cosmic-gravity action of the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>, computed on this totality theory, is engaged in controlling material systems beyond the borders of the present organized universes. These calculations all refer to absolute gravity; linear gravity is an interactive phenomenon which can be computed only by knowing the actual <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_gravity">Paradise gravity</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_9">12:3.9</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Spiritual Gravity.</i> By the same technique of comparative estimation and calculation these researchers have explored the present reaction capacity of spirit gravity and, with the co-operation of <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a> and other spirit personalities, have arrived at the summation of the active spirit gravity of the <a href="/en/topic/Second_Source_and_Center">Second Source and Center</a>. And it is most instructive to note that they find about the same value for the actual and functional presence of spirit gravity in the grand universe that they postulate for the present total of active spirit gravity. In other words: At the present time practically the entire spirit gravity of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, computed on this theory of totality, is observable as functioning in the grand universe. If these findings are dependable, we may conclude that the universes now evolving in outer space are at the present time wholly nonspiritual. And if this is true, it would satisfactorily explain why spirit-endowed beings are in possession of little or no information about these vast energy manifestations aside from knowing the fact of their physical existence.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_10">12:3.10</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Mind Gravity.</i> By these same principles of comparative computation these experts have attacked the problem of mind-gravity presence and response. The mind unit of estimation was arrived at by averaging three material and three spiritual types of mentality, although the type of mind found in the power directors and their associates proved to be a disturbing factor in the effort to arrive at a basic unit for mind-gravity estimation. There was little to impede the estimation of the present capacity of the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a> for mind-gravity function in accordance with this theory of totality. Although the findings in this instance are not so conclusive as in the estimates of physical and spirit <a href="/en/topic/gravity">gravity</a>, they are, comparatively considered, very instructive, even intriguing. These investigators deduce that about eighty-five per cent of the mind-gravity response to the intellectual drawing of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> takes origin in the existing grand universe. This would suggest the possibility that mind activities are involved in connection with the observable physical activities now in progress throughout the realms of outer space. While this estimate is probably far from accurate, it accords, in principle, with our belief that intelligent force organizers are at present directing universe evolution in the <a href="/en/topic/space_levels">space levels</a> beyond the present outer limits of the grand universe. Whatever the nature of this postulated intelligence, it is apparently not spirit-gravity responsive.</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_11">12:3.11</a></small></sup>  But all these computations are at best estimates based on assumed laws. We think they are fairly reliable. Even if a few spirit beings were located in outer space, their collective presence would not markedly influence calculations involving such enormous measurements.</p>
