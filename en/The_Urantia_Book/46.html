Your local system has passed through some stormy experiences, but it is at present being administered most efficiently, and as the ages pass, the results of disharmony are being slowly but surely eradicated. Order and good will are being restored, and the conditions on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> are more and more approaching the heavenly status of your traditions, for the system headquarters is truly the <a href="/en/topic/heaven">heaven</a> visualized by the majority of twentieth-century religious believers.</p>

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF JERUSEM </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_1">46:1.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> is divided into one thousand latitudinal sectors and ten thousand longitudinal zones. The sphere has seven major capitals and seventy minor administrative centers. The seven sectional capitals are concerned with diverse activities, and the System Sovereign is present in each at least once a year.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_2">46:1.2</a></small></sup>  The standard <a href="/en/topic/mile">mile</a> of Jerusem is equivalent to about seven <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> miles. The standard weight, the ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/gradant">gradant</a>,‚Äù is built up through the decimal system from the mature ultimaton and represents almost exactly ten ounces of your weight. The <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> day equals three days of Urantia <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a>, less one hour, four minutes, and fifteen seconds, that being the time of the axial revolution of Jerusem. The system year consists of one hundred Jerusem days. The time of the system is broadcast by the master <a href="/en/topic/chronoldeks">chronoldeks</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_3">46:1.3</a></small></sup>  The energy of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> is superbly controlled and circulates about the sphere in the zone channels, which are directly fed from the energy charges of space and expertly administered by the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Physical_Controllers">Master Physical Controllers</a>. The natural resistance to the passage of these energies through the physical channels of conduction yields the heat required for the production of the equable temperature of Jerusem. The full-light temperature is maintained at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, while during the period of light recession it falls to a little lower than 50 degrees.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_4">46:1.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/lighting">lighting</a> system of Jerusem should not be so difficult for you to comprehend<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. There are no days and nights, no seasons of heat and cold. The <a href="/en/topic/power_transformers">power transformers</a> maintain one hundred thousand centers from which rarefied energies are projected upward through the planetary atmosphere, undergoing certain changes, until they reach the electric air-ceiling of the sphere; and then these energies are reflected back and down as a gentle, sifting, and even light of about the intensity of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> sunlight when the sun is shining overhead at ten o‚Äôclock in the morning.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_5">46:1.5</a></small></sup>  Under such conditions of lighting, the light rays do not seem to come from one place; they just sift out of the sky, emanating equally from all space directions. This light is very similar to natural sunlight except that it contains very much less heat. Thus it will be recognized that such headquarters worlds are not luminous in space; if <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> were very near Urantia, it would not be visible.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_6">46:1.6</a></small></sup>  The gases which reflect this light-energy from the Jerusem upper ionosphere back to the ground are very similar to those in the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> upper air belts which are concerned with the auroral phenomena of your so-called <a href="/en/topic/northern_lights">northern lights</a>, although these are produced by different causes. On Urantia it is this same gas shield which prevents the escape of the terrestrial broadcast waves, reflecting them earthward when they strike this gas belt in their direct outward flight. In this way <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> are held near the surface as they journey through the air around your world.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_7">46:1.7</a></small></sup>  This <a href="/en/topic/lighting">lighting</a> of the sphere is uniformly maintained for seventy-five per cent of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> day, and then there is a gradual recession until, at the time of minimum illumination, the light is about that of your full moon on a clear night. This is the quiet hour for all Jerusem. Only the broadcast-receiving stations are in operation during this period of rest and rehabilitation.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_8">46:1.8</a></small></sup>  Jerusem receives faint light from several near-by suns‚Äîa sort of brilliant starlight‚Äîbut it is not dependent on them; worlds like Jerusem are not subject to the vicissitudes of sun disturbances, neither are they confronted with the problem of a cooling or dying sun.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_9">46:1.9</a></small></sup>  The seven transitional study worlds and their forty-nine satellites are heated, lighted, energized, and watered by the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> technique.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_1">46:2.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> you will miss the rugged mountain ranges of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and other evolved worlds since there are neither earthquakes nor rainfalls, but you will enjoy the beauteous highlands and other unique variations of topography and landscape. Enormous areas of Jerusem are preserved in a ‚Äúnatural state,‚Äù and the grandeur of such districts is quite beyond the powers of human imagination.</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_2">46:2.2</a></small></sup>  There are thousands upon thousands of small <a href="/en/topic/lakes">lakes</a> but no raging <a href="/en/topic/rivers">rivers</a> nor expansive <a href="/en/topic/oceans">oceans</a>. There is no rainfall, neither <a href="/en/topic/storms">storms</a> nor blizzards, on any of the architectural worlds, but there is the daily precipitation of the condensation of moisture during the time of lowest temperature attending the light recession. (The <a href="/en/topic/dew_point">dew point</a> is higher on a three-gas world than on a two-gas planet like Urantia.) The physical plant life and the morontia world of living things both require moisture, but this is largely supplied by the subsoil system of circulation which extends all over the sphere, even up to the very tops of the highlands. This <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> system is not entirely subsurface, for there are many canals interconnecting the sparkling lakes of Jerusem.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_3">46:2.3</a></small></sup>  The atmosphere of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> is a three-gas mixture. This air is very similar to that of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> with the addition of a gas adapted to the <a href="/en/topic/respiration">respiration</a> of the morontia order of life. This third gas in no way unfits the air for the respiration of animals or plants of the material orders.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_4">46:2.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/transportation">transportation</a> system is allied with the circulatory streams of energy movement, these main energy currents being located at ten-mile intervals. By adjustment of physical mechanisms the material beings of the planet can proceed at a pace varying from two to five hundred miles per hour. The transport <a href="/en/topic/birds">birds</a> fly at about one hundred miles an hour. The air mechanisms of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> travel around five hundred miles per hour. Material and early morontia beings must utilize these mechanical means of transport, but spirit personalities proceed by liaison with the superior forces and spirit sources of energy.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_5">46:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> and its associated worlds are endowed with the ten standard divisions of physical life characteristic of the <a href="/en/topic/architectural_spheres">architectural spheres</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. And since there is no organic <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> on Jerusem, there are no conflicting forms of life, no struggle for existence, no survival of the fittest. Rather is there a creative adaptation which foreshadows the beauty, the harmony, and the perfection of the eternal worlds of the central and divine universe. And in all this creative perfection there is the most amazing intermingling of physical and of morontia life, artistically contrasted by the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_artisans">celestial artisans</a> and their fellows.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_6">46:2.6</a></small></sup>  Jerusem is indeed a foretaste of paradisiacal glory and grandeur. But you can never hope to gain an adequate idea of these glorious architectural worlds by any attempted <a href="/en/topic/Revelations,_Book_of">description</a>. There is so little that can be compared with aught on your world, and even then the things of Jerusem so transcend the things of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> that the comparison is almost grotesque. Until you actually arrive on Jerusem, you can hardly entertain anything like a true concept of the heavenly worlds, but that is not so long a time in the future when your coming experience on the system capital is compared with your sometime arrival on the more remote training spheres of the universe, the superuniverse, and <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_7">46:2.7</a></small></sup>  The manufacturing or laboratory sector of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> is an extensive domain, one which Urantians would hardly recognize since it has no smoking chimneys; nevertheless, there is an intricate material economy associated with these special worlds, and there is a perfection of mechanical technique and physical achievement which would astonish and even awe your most experienced chemists and inventors. Pause to consider that this first world of detention in the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> journey is far more material than spiritual. Throughout your stay on Jerusem and its transition worlds you are far nearer your earth life of material things than your later life of advancing spirit existence.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_8">46:2.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Seraph">Mount Seraph</a> is the highest elevation on Jerusem, almost fifteen thousand feet, and is the point of departure for all <a href="/en/topic/transport_seraphim">transport seraphim</a>. Numerous mechanical developments are used in providing initial energy for escaping the planetary gravity and overcoming the air resistance. A seraphic transport departs every three seconds of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time throughout the light period and, sometimes, far into the recession. The transporters take off at about twenty-five standard miles per second of Urantia time and do not attain standard velocity until they are over two thousand miles away from Jerusem.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_9">46:2.9</a></small></sup>  Transports arrive on the crystal field, the so-called sea of glass<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Around this area are the receiving stations for the various orders of beings who traverse space by seraphic transport.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p3_1">46:3.1</a></small></sup>  The superuniverse and Paradise-Havona <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> are received on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> in liaison with <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and by a technique involving the polar crystal, the sea of glass. In addition to provisions for the reception of these extra-Nebadon communications, there are three distinct groups of receiving stations. These separate but tricircular groups of stations are adjusted to the reception of broadcasts from the local worlds, from the constellation headquarters, and from the capital of the local universe. All these broadcasts are automatically displayed so as to be discernible by all types of beings present in the central broadcast <a href="/en/topic/amphitheater">amphitheater</a>; of all preoccupations for an ascendant mortal on Jerusem, none is more engaging and engrossing than that of listening in on the never-ending stream of universe space reports.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p3_2">46:3.2</a></small></sup>  This Jerusem broadcast-receiving station is encircled by an enormous amphitheater, constructed of scintillating materials largely unknown on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and seating over five billion beings‚Äîmaterial and morontia‚Äîbesides accommodating innumerable spirit personalities. It is the favorite diversion for all Jerusem to spend their leisure at the broadcast station, there to learn of the welfare and state of the universe. And this is the only planetary activity which is not slowed down during the recession of light.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p3_3">46:3.3</a></small></sup>  At this broadcast-receiving <a href="/en/topic/amphitheater">amphitheater</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> messages are coming in continuously<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. Near by, the <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> word of the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a> is received at least once a day. Periodically the regular and special <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> are relayed through Salvington, and when <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> messages are in reception, the entire population is assembled around the sea of glass, and the Uversa friends add the <a href="/en/topic/reflectivity">reflectivity</a> phenomena to the technique of the Paradise broadcast so that everything heard becomes visible. And it is in this manner that continual foretastes of advancing beauty and grandeur are afforded the mortal survivors as they journey inward on the eternal adventure.</p>

On Jerusem and in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> these arrangements are designed as follows:</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p4_2">46:4.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/circles">circles</a>‚Äî</i>the nonnative residential areas.</p>

<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p4_7">46:4.7</a></small></sup>  Our narrative of these residential and administrative areas takes no account of the vast and beautiful estates of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/permanent_citizens">permanent citizens</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, neither do we mention numerous other fascinating orders of spirit and near-spirit creatures. For example: Jerusem enjoys the efficient services of the <a href="/en/topic/spironga">spironga</a> of design for system function. These beings are devoted to spiritual ministry in behalf of the supermaterial residents and visitors. They are a wonderful group of intelligent and beautiful beings who are the transition servants of the higher morontia creatures and of the morontia helpers who labor for the upkeep and embellishment of all morontia creations. They are on Jerusem what the midway creatures are on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, midway helpers functioning between the material and the spiritual.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p4_8">46:4.8</a></small></sup>  The system capitals are unique in that they are the only worlds which exhibit well-nigh perfectly all three phases of universe existence: the material, the morontial, and the spiritual. Whether you are a material, morontia, or spirit personality, you will feel at home on Jerusem; so also do the combined beings, such as the midway creatures and the Material Sons.</p>

They have a vision which permits them to recognize‚Äîin addition to material beings‚Äîthe morontia creations, the lower angelic orders, midway creatures, and some of the lower orders of spirit personalities. They do not comprehend worship of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a>, nor do they grasp the import of the Eternal, but they do, through affection for their masters, join in the outward spiritual devotions of their realms.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_8">46:7.8</a></small></sup>  There are those who believe that, in a future universe age, these faithful <a href="/en/topic/spornagia">spornagia</a> will escape from their animal level of existence and attain a worthy evolutional destiny of progressive intellectual growth and even spiritual achievement.</p>

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_1">46:8.1</a></small></sup>  The purely local and routine affairs of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> are directed from the one hundred <i><a href="/en/topic/triangles">triangles</a>.</i> These units are clustered around the ten marvelous structures domiciling the local administration of Jerusem. The triangles are surrounded by the panoramic depiction of the system headquarters history. At present there is an erasure of over two standard miles in this circular <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a>. This sector will be restored upon the readmission of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> into the constellation family. Every provision for this event has been made by the decrees of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, but the tribunal of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> has not yet finished the adjudication of the affairs of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>. Satania may not come back into the full fellowship of <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a> so long as it harbors archrebels, high created beings who have fallen from light into darkness.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_2">46:8.2</a></small></sup>  When Satania can return to the constellation fold, then will come up for consideration the readmission of the isolated worlds into the system family of inhabited planets, accompanied by their restoration to the spiritual communion of the realms. But even if <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> were restored to the system circuits, you would still be embarrassed by the fact that your whole system rests under a Norlatiadek <a href="/en/topic/quarantine">quarantine</a> partially segregating it from all other systems.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_3">46:8.3</a></small></sup>  But ere long, the adjudication of <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> and his associates will restore the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> system to the <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a> constellation, and subsequently, Urantia and the other isolated spheres will be restored to the Satania circuits, and again will such worlds enjoy the privileges of interplanetary communication and intersystem communion.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_4">46:8.4</a></small></sup>  There will come an end for rebels and rebellion. The <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Rulers">Supreme Rulers</a> are merciful and patient, but the law of deliberately nourished evil is universally and unerringly executed. ‚ÄúThe wages of <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> is death‚Äù‚Äîeternal obliteration<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
