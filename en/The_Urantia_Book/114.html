<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_1">114:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> rule in the kingdoms of men through many celestial forces and agencies but chiefly through the ministry of <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a><sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_2">114:0.2</a></small></sup>  At noon today the roll call of planetary <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, guardians, and others on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> was 501,234,619 pairs of seraphim. There were assigned to my command two hundred <a href="/en/topic/seraphic_hosts">seraphic hosts</a>—597,196,800 pairs of seraphim, or 1,194,393,600 individual angels. The registry, however, shows 1,002,469,238 individuals; it follows therefore that 191,924,362 angels were absent from this world on transport, messenger, and death duty. (On Urantia there are about the same number of <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a> as seraphim, and they are similarly organized.)</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_3">114:0.3</a></small></sup>  Seraphim and their associated cherubim have much to do with the details of the superhuman government of a planet, especially of worlds which have been isolated by rebellion. The angels, ably assisted by the <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>, function on Urantia as the actual supermaterial ministers who execute the mandates of the resident governor general and all his associates and subordinates. Seraphim as a class are occupied with many assignments other than those of personal and group guardianship.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_4">114:0.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is not without proper and effective supervision from the system, constellation, and universe rulers. But the planetary government is unlike that of any other world in the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> system, even in all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. This uniqueness in your plan of supervision is due to a number of unusual circumstances:</p>

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE SOVEREIGNTY OF URANTIA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_1">114:1.1</a></small></sup>  The original sovereignty of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> was held in trust by the sovereign of the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> system. It was first delegated by him to a joint commission of Melchizedeks and <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, and this group functioned on Urantia until the arrival of a regularly constituted Planetary Prince. Subsequent to the downfall of Prince <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>, at the time of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>, Urantia had no sure and settled relationship with the local universe and its administrative divisions until the completion of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>’s bestowal in the flesh, when he was proclaimed, by the Union of Days, <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Prince_of_Urantia">Planetary Prince of Urantia</a>. Such a proclamation in surety and in principle forever settled the status of your world, but in practice the Sovereign <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> made no gesture of personal administration of the planet aside from the establishment of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> commission of twenty-four former Urantians with authority to represent him in the government of Urantia and all other quarantined planets in the system<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>. One of this council is now always resident on Urantia as resident governor general<sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_2">114:1.2</a></small></sup>  Vicegerent authority to act for Michael as Planetary Prince has been recently vested in <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, but this Son of the local universe has made not the slightest move toward modifying the present planetary regime of the successive administrations of the resident governors general.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_3">114:1.3</a></small></sup>  There is little likelihood that any marked change will be made in the government of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> during the present dispensation unless the vicegerent Planetary Prince should arrive to assume his titular responsibilities. It appears to certain of our associates that at some time in the near future the plan of sending one of the twenty-four counselors to Urantia to act as governor general will be superseded by the formal arrival of Machiventa Melchizedek with the vicegerent mandate of the sovereignty of Urantia. As acting Planetary Prince he would undoubtedly continue in charge of the planet until the final adjudication of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a> and probably on into the distant future of planetary settlement in light and life.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_4">114:1.4</a></small></sup>  Some believe that Machiventa will not come to take personal direction of Urantian affairs until the end of the current dispensation. Others hold that the vicegerent Prince may not come, as such, until <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> sometime returns to Urantia as he promised when still in the flesh. Still others, including this narrator, look for <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>’s appearance any day or hour.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE BOARD OF PLANETARY SUPERVISORS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_1">114:2.1</a></small></sup>  Since the times of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>’s bestowal on your world the general management of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> has been intrusted to a special group on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> of twenty-four onetime Urantians. Qualification for membership on this commission is unknown to us, but we have observed that those who have been thus commissioned have all been contributors to the enlarging sovereignty of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> in the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. By nature they were all real leaders when they functioned on Urantia, and (excepting <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>) these qualities of leadership have been further augmented by mansion world experience and supplemented by the training of Jerusem citizenship. Members are nominated to the twenty-four by the cabinet of <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, seconded by the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>, approved by the <a href="/en/topic/Assigned_Sentinels">Assigned Sentinel</a> of Jerusem, and appointed by <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> in accordance with the mandate of Michael. The temporary appointees function just as fully as do the permanent members of this commission of special supervisors.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_2">114:2.2</a></small></sup>  This board of planetary directors is especially concerned with the supervision of those activities on this world which result from the fact that Michael here experienced his terminal bestowal. They are kept in close and immediate touch with Michael by the liaison activities of a certain <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Star</a>, the identical being who attended upon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> throughout the mortal bestowal.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_3">114:2.3</a></small></sup>  At the present time one John, known to you as “the Baptist,” is chairman of this council when it is in session on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>. But the ex officio head of this council is the <a href="/en/topic/Assigned_Sentinel_of_Satania">Assigned Sentinel of Satania</a>, the direct and personal representative of the Associate Inspector on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Executive_#7_(of_Orvonton)">Supreme Executive of Orvonton</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_4">114:2.4</a></small></sup>  The members of this same commission of former Urantians also act as advisory supervisors of the thirty-six other rebellion-isolated worlds of the system; they perform a very valuable service in keeping <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, the System Sovereign, in close and sympathetic touch with the affairs of these planets, which still remain more or less under the overcontrol of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a>. These twenty-four counselors make frequent trips as individuals to each of the quarantined planets, especially to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_5">114:2.5</a></small></sup>  Each of the other isolated worlds is advised by similar and varying sized commissions of its onetime inhabitants, but these other commissions are subordinate to the Urantian group of twenty-four. While the members of the latter commission are thus actively interested in every phase of human progress on each quarantined world in <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, they are especially and particularly concerned with the welfare and advancement of the mortal races of Urantia, for they immediately and directly supervise the affairs of none of the planets except Urantia, and even here their authority is not complete excepting in certain domains concerned with mortal survival.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_6">114:2.6</a></small></sup>  No one knows how long these twenty-four <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> counselors will continue in their present status, detached from the regular program of universe activities. They will no doubt continue to serve in their present capacities until some change in planetary status ensues, such as the end of a dispensation, the assumption of full authority by <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, the final adjudication of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>, or the reappearance of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> on the world of his final bestowal. The present resident governor general of Urantia seems inclined to the opinion that all but Machiventa may be released for <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascension the moment the system of Satania is restored to the constellation circuits. But other opinions are also current.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE RESIDENT GOVERNOR GENERAL </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_1">114:3.1</a></small></sup>  Every one hundred years of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time, the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> corps of twenty-four planetary supervisors designate one of their number to sojourn on your world to act as their executive representative, as resident governor general. During the times of the preparation of these narratives this executive officer was changed, the nineteenth so to serve being succeeded by the twentieth. The name of the current planetary supervisor is withheld from you only because mortal man is so prone to venerate, even to deify, his extraordinary compatriots and superhuman superiors.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_2">114:3.2</a></small></sup>  The resident governor general has no actual personal authority in the management of world affairs except as the representative of the twenty-four Jerusem counselors. He acts as the co-ordinator of superhuman administration and is the respected head and universally recognized leader of the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> functioning on Urantia. All orders of angelic hosts regard him as their co-ordinating director, while the United Midwayers, since the departure of 1-2-3 <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to become one of the twenty-four counselors, really look upon the successive governors general as their planetary fathers.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_3">114:3.3</a></small></sup>  Although the governor general does not possess actual and personal authority on the planet, he hands down scores of rulings and decisions each day which are accepted as final by all personalities concerned. He is much more of a fatherly adviser than a technical ruler. In certain ways he functions as would a Planetary Prince, but his administration much more closely resembles that of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_4">114:3.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> government is represented in the councils of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> in accordance with an arrangement whereby the returning governor general sits as a temporary member of the System Sovereign’s cabinet of <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a>. It was expected, when Machiventa was designated vicegerent Prince, that he would immediately assume his place in the council of the Planetary Princes of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, but thus far he has made no gesture in this direction.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_5">114:3.5</a></small></sup>  The supermaterial government of Urantia does not maintain a very close organic relationship with the higher units of the local universe. In a way, the resident governor general represents <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> as well as Jerusem since he acts on behalf of the twenty-four counselors, who are directly representative of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>. And being a Jerusem citizen, the planetary governor can function as a spokesman for the System Sovereign. The constellation authorities are represented directly by a Vorondadek Son, the <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">observer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE MOST HIGH OBSERVER </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_1">114:4.1</a></small></sup>  The sovereignty of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is further complicated by the onetime arbitrary seizure of planetary authority by the government of <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a> shortly after the planetary rebellion. There is still resident on Urantia a Vorondadek Son, an <a href="/en/topic/observer">observer</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> and, in the absence of direct action by <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>, trustee of planetary sovereignty. The present <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a> (and sometime regent) is the twenty-third thus to serve on Urantia.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_2">114:4.2</a></small></sup>  There are certain groups of planetary problems which are still under the control of the Most Highs of Edentia, jurisdiction over them having been seized at the time of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>. Authority in these matters is exercised by a Vorondadek Son, the Norlatiadek observer, who maintains very close advisory relations with the planetary supervisors. The <a href="/en/topic/race_commissioners">race commissioners</a> are very active on Urantia, and their various group chiefs are informally attached to the resident Vorondadek observer, who acts as their advisory director.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_3">114:4.3</a></small></sup>  In a crisis the actual and sovereign head of the government, excepting in certain purely spiritual matters, would be this Vorondadek Son of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> now on observation duty. (In these exclusively spiritual problems and in certain purely personal matters, the supreme authority seems to be vested in the commanding archangel attached to the divisional headquarters of that order which was recently established on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.)</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_4">114:4.4</a></small></sup>  A <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a> is empowered, at his discretion, to seize the planetary government in times of grave planetary crises, and it is of record that this has happened thirty-three times in the history of Urantia. At such times the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> <a href="/en/topic/observer">observer</a> functions as the Most High regent, exercising unquestioned authority over all ministers and administrators resident on the planet excepting only the divisional organization of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_5">114:4.5</a></small></sup>  Vorondadek regencies are not peculiar to rebellion-isolated planets, for the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> may intervene at any time in the affairs of the inhabited worlds, interposing the superior wisdom of the constellation rulers in the affairs of the kingdoms of men.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. THE PLANETARY GOVERNMENT </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_1">114:5.1</a></small></sup>  The actual administration of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is indeed difficult to describe. There exists no formal government along the lines of universe organization, such as separate legislative, executive, and judicial departments. The twenty-four counselors come the nearest to being the legislative branch of the planetary government. The governor general is a provisional and advisory chief executive with the <a href="/en/topic/veto">veto</a> power resident in the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a>. And there are no absolutely authoritative judicial powers operative on the planet—only the <a href="/en/topic/conciliating_commissions">conciliating commissions</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_2">114:5.2</a></small></sup>  A majority of the problems involving <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> and <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> are, by mutual consent, decided by the governor general. But except when voicing the mandates of the twenty-four counselors, his rulings are all subject to appeal to conciliating commissions, to local authorities constituted for planetary function, or even to the System Sovereign of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_3">114:5.3</a></small></sup>  The absence of the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> of a Planetary Prince and the material regime of an Adamic Son and Daughter is partially compensated by the special ministry of seraphim and by the unusual services of the midway creatures. The absence of the Planetary Prince is effectively compensated by the triune presence of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a>, and the governor general.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_4">114:5.4</a></small></sup>  This rather loosely organized and somewhat personally administered planetary government is more than expectedly effective because of the timesaving assistance of the archangels and their ever-ready circuit, which is so frequently utilized in planetary emergencies and administrative difficulties. Technically, the planet is still spiritually isolated in the <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a> circuits, but in an emergency this handicap can now be circumvented through utilization of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels’_circuit">archangels’ circuit</a>. Planetary isolation is, of course, of little concern to individual <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> since the pouring out of the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> upon all flesh nineteen hundred years ago.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_5">114:5.5</a></small></sup>  Each administrative day on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> begins with a consultative conference, which is attended by the governor general, the planetary chief of <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a>, the supervising <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, the chief of resident <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, and invited guests from among the high Sons of the universe or from among certain of the <a href="/en/topic/student_visitors">student visitors</a> who may chance to be sojourning on the planet.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_6">114:5.6</a></small></sup>  The direct administrative cabinet of the governor general consists of twelve <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>, the acting chiefs of the twelve groups of special angels functioning as the immediate superhuman directors of planetary progress and stability.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. THE MASTER SERAPHIM OF PLANETARY SUPERVISION </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_1">114:6.1</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> governor general arrived on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, concurrent with the outpouring of the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a>, he was accompanied by twelve corps of special <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Seraphington">Seraphington</a> graduates, who were immediately assigned to certain special planetary services. These exalted <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> are known as the <a href="/en/topic/master_seraphim_of_planetary_supervision">master seraphim of planetary supervision</a> and are, aside from the overcontrol of the planetary <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">Most High observer</a>, under the immediate direction of the resident governor general.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_2">114:6.2</a></small></sup>  These twelve groups of angels, while functioning under the general supervision of the resident governor general, are immediately directed by the seraphic council of twelve, the acting chiefs of each group.

These celestial ministers are intrusted with the oversight and direction of the affairs of each generation as they are designed to fit into the mosaic of the age in which they occur. The present corps of epochal angels serving on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is the third group assigned to the planet during the current dispensation.</p>

<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_7">114:6.7</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/religious_guardians">religious guardians</a>.</i> These are the “<a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of the churches,” the earnest contenders for that which is and has been<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. They endeavor to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of moral values from one epoch to another. They are the checkmates of the angels of progress, all the while seeking to translate from one generation to another the imperishable values of the old and passing forms into the new and therefore less stabilized patterns of thought and conduct. These angels do contend for spiritual forms, but they are not the source of ultrasectarianism and meaningless controversial divisions of professed religionists.

These <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> are closely associated with the ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/race_commissioners">race commissioners</a>, and the group now on Urantia is the original corps assigned to the planet soon after the day of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>.</p>

<p id="p6_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_17">114:6.17</a></small></sup>  When these groups of master <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> disagree in matters of planetary policy or procedure, their differences are usually composed by the governor general, but all his rulings are subject to appeal in accordance with the nature and gravity of the issues involved in the disagreement.</p>
<p id="p6_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_18">114:6.18</a></small></sup>  None of these angelic groups exercise direct or arbitrary control over the domains of their assignment.

<p id="p6_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_20">114:6.20</a></small></sup>  But aside from these many means of positive action, the master seraphim insure planetary progress against vital jeopardy through the mobilization, training, and maintenance of the <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>. The chief function of these <a href="/en/topic/reservists">reservists</a> is to insure against breakdown of evolutionary progress; they are the provisions which the celestial forces have made against surprise; they are the guarantees against disaster.</p>
<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. THE RESERVE CORPS OF DESTINY </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_1">114:7.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a> consists of living men and women who have been admitted to the special service of the superhuman administration of world affairs. This corps is made up of the men and women of each generation who are chosen by the spirit directors of the realm to assist in the conduct of the ministry of mercy and wisdom to the children of time on the evolutionary worlds. It is the general practice in the conduct of the affairs of the ascension plans to begin this liaison utilization of mortal will creatures immediately they are competent and trustworthy to assume such responsibilities. Accordingly, as soon as men and women appear on the stage of temporal action with sufficient mental capacity, adequate moral status, and requisite spirituality, they are quickly assigned to the appropriate celestial group of planetary personalities as human liaisons, mortal assistants.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_2">114:7.2</a></small></sup>  When human beings are chosen as protectors of planetary destiny, when they become pivotal individuals in the plans which the world administrators are prosecuting, at that time the planetary chief of <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> confirms their temporal attachment to the seraphic corps and appoints personal destiny guardians to serve with these mortal <a href="/en/topic/reservists">reservists</a>. All reservists have self-conscious Adjusters, and most of them function in the higher cosmic circles of intellectual achievement and spiritual attainment.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_3">114:7.3</a></small></sup>  Mortals of the realm are chosen for service in the <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a> on the inhabited worlds because of:</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_4">114:7.4</a></small></sup>  1. Special capacity for being secretly rehearsed for numerous possible emergency missions in the conduct of various activities of world affairs.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_5">114:7.5</a></small></sup>  2. Wholehearted dedication to some special social, economic, political, spiritual, or other cause, coupled with willingness to serve without human <a href="/en/topic/recognition">recognition</a> and rewards.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_6">114:7.6</a></small></sup>  3. The possession of a Thought Adjuster of extraordinary versatility and probable pre-Urantia experience in coping with planetary difficulties and contending with impending world emergency situations.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_7">114:7.7</a></small></sup>  Each division of planetary celestial service is entitled to a liaison corps of these <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of destiny standing. The average inhabited world employs seventy separate corps of destiny, which are intimately connected with the superhuman current conduct of world affairs. On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> there are twelve <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>, one for each of the planetary groups of seraphic supervision.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_8">114:7.8</a></small></sup>  The twelve groups of Urantia <a href="/en/topic/destiny_reservists">destiny reservists</a> are composed of mortal inhabitants of the sphere who have been rehearsed for numerous crucial positions on earth and are held in readiness to act in possible planetary emergencies. This combined corps now consists of 962 persons. The smallest corps numbers 41 and the largest 172. With the exception of less than a score of <a href="/en/topic/contact_personalities">contact personalities</a>, the members of this unique group are wholly unconscious of their preparation for possible function in certain planetary crises. These mortal <a href="/en/topic/reservists">reservists</a> are chosen by the corps to which they are respectively attached and are likewise trained and rehearsed in the deep mind by the combined technique of Thought Adjuster and seraphic guardian ministry. Many times numerous other celestial personalities participate in this unconscious training, and in all this special preparation the <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> perform valuable and indispensable services.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9">114:7.9</a></small></sup>  On many worlds the better adapted secondary midway creatures are able to attain varying degrees of contact with the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> of certain favorably constituted <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> through the skillful penetration of the minds of the latters’ indwelling. (And it was by just such a fortuitous combination of cosmic adjustments that these revelations were materialized in the <a href="/en/topic/English_language">English language</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.) Such potential contact mortals of the evolutionary worlds are mobilized in the numerous reserve corps, and it is, to a certain extent, through these small groups of forward-looking personalities that spiritual civilization is advanced and the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> are able to rule in the kingdoms of men. The men and women of these <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a> thus have various degrees of contact with their Adjusters through the intervening ministry of the midway creatures; but these same mortals are little known to their fellows except in those rare social emergencies and spiritual exigencies wherein these reserve personalities function for the prevention of the breakdown of evolutionary culture or the extinction of the light of living truth. On Urantia these reservists of destiny have seldom been emblazoned on the pages of human history.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_10">114:7.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/reservists">reservists</a> unconsciously act as conservators of essential planetary information. Many times, upon the death of a reservist, a transfer of certain vital data from the mind of the dying reservist to a younger successor is made by a liaison of the two Thought Adjusters. The Adjusters undoubtedly function in many other ways unknown to us, in connection with these reserve corps.</p>
<p id="p7_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_11">114:7.11</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> the <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>, though having no permanent head, does have its own permanent councils which constitute its governing organization. These embrace the judiciary council, the historicity council, the council on political sovereignty, and many others. From time to time, in accordance with the corps organization, titular (mortal) heads of the whole reserve corps have been commissioned by these permanent councils for specific function. The tenure of such reservist chiefs is usually a matter of a few hours’ duration, being limited to the accomplishment of some specific task at hand.</p>
<p id="p7_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_12">114:7.12</a></small></sup>  The Urantia reserve corps had its largest membership in the days of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a>, steadily declining with the dilution of the violet blood and reaching its low point around the time of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>, since which time reserve corps membership has steadily increased.</p>
<p id="p7_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_13">114:7.13</a></small></sup>  (The cosmic reserve corps of universe-conscious citizens on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> now numbers over one thousand <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> whose insight of cosmic citizenship far transcends the sphere of their terrestrial abode, but I am forbidden to reveal the real nature of the function of this unique group of living human beings.)</p>
<p id="p7_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_14">114:7.14</a></small></sup>  Urantia mortals should not allow the comparative spiritual isolation of their world from certain of the local universe circuits to produce a feeling of cosmic desertion or planetary orphanage. There is operative on the planet a very definite and effective superhuman supervision of world affairs and human destinies.</p>
<p id="p7_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_15">114:7.15</a></small></sup>  But it is true that you can have, at best, only a meager idea of an ideal planetary government. Since the early times of the Planetary Prince, <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> has suffered from the miscarriage of the divine plan of world growth and racial development. The loyal inhabited worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> are not governed as is Urantia. Nevertheless, compared with the other isolated worlds, your planetary governments have not been so inferior; only one or two worlds may be said to be worse, and a few may be slightly better, but the majority are on a plane of equality with you.</p>
<p id="p7_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_16">114:7.16</a></small></sup>  No one in the local universe seems to know when the unsettled status of the planetary administration will terminate. The <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> Melchizedeks are inclined to the opinion that little change will occur in the planetary government and administration until <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>’s second personal arrival on Urantia. Undoubtedly at this time, if not before, sweeping changes will be effected in planetary management. But as to the nature of such modifications of world administration, no one seems to be able even to conjecture. There is no precedent for such an episode in all the history of the inhabited worlds of the universe of Nebadon. Among the many things difficult to understand concerning the future government of Urantia, a prominent one is the location on the planet of a circuit and divisional headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_17">114:7.17</a></small></sup>  Your isolated world is not forgotten in the counsels of the universe. <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is not a cosmic orphan stigmatized by sin and shut away from divine watchcare by rebellion. From <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and on down to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, even in <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, they all know we are here; and you <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> now dwelling on Urantia are just as lovingly cherished and just as faithfully watched over as if the sphere had never been betrayed by a faithless Planetary Prince, even more so.
