<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p0_1">35:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> previously introduced have had a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> origin. They are the offspring of the divine Rulers of the universal domains. Of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> Paradise order of sonship, the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a>, there is in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> only one, <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, the universe father and sovereign. Of the second order of Paradise sonship, the Avonal or <a href="/en/topic/Magisterial_Sons">Magisterial Sons</a>, Nebadon has its full quota‚Äî1,062. And these ‚Äúlesser Christs‚Äù are just as effective and all-powerful in their planetary bestowals as was the Creator and <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Son on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. The third order, being of <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> origin, do not register in a local universe, but I estimate there are in Nebadon between fifteen and twenty thousand <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a> exclusive of 9,642 <a href="/en/topic/creature-trinitized_sons">creature-trinitized assistants</a> of record. These Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Daynals,_order_of">Daynals</a> are neither magistrates nor administrators; they are superteachers.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p0_2">35:0.2</a></small></sup>  The types of Sons about to be considered are of local universe origin; they are the offspring of a Paradise Creator Son in varied association with the complemental Universe Mother Spirit. The following orders of local universe sonship find mention in these narratives:</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p0_3">35:0.3</a></small></sup>  1. <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedek Sons</a>.</p>

<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p0_7">35:0.7</a></small></sup>  Triune <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> functions for the creation of three orders of sonship: the <a href="/en/topic/Michael,_order_of">Michaels</a>, the Avonals, and the <a href="/en/topic/Daynals,_order_of">Daynals</a>. Dual Deity in the local universe, the Son and the Spirit, also functions in the creation of three high orders of Sons: the Melchizedeks, the Vorondadeks, and the Lanonandeks; and having achieved this threefold expression, they collaborate with the next level of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Sevenfold">God the Sevenfold</a> in the production of the versatile order of <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>. These beings are classified with the <a href="/en/topic/descending_Sons_of_God">descending Sons of God</a>, but they are a unique and original form of universe life. Their consideration will occupy the whole of the next paper.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. THE FATHER MELCHIZEDEK </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p1_1">35:1.1</a></small></sup>  After bringing into existence the beings of personal aid, such as the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a> and other administrative personalities, in accordance with the divine purpose and creative plans of a given universe, there occurs a new form of creative union between the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the Creative Spirit, the local universe Daughter of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. The personality offspring resulting from this creative partnership is the original <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>‚Äîthe <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a>‚Äîthat unique being who subsequently collaborates with the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit to bring into existence the entire group of that name.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p1_2">35:1.2</a></small></sup>  In the universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> the Father Melchizedek acts as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> executive associate of the Bright and Morning Star. <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> is occupied more with universe policies, Melchizedek with practical procedures. Gabriel presides over the regularly constituted tribunals and councils of Nebadon, Melchizedek over the special, extraordinary, and emergency commissions and advisory bodies. Gabriel and the Father Melchizedek are never away from <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> at the same time, for in Gabriel‚Äôs absence the Father Melchizedek functions as the chief executive of Nebadon.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p1_3">35:1.3</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks of our universe were all created within one millennial period of standard time by the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the Creative Spirit in liaison with the <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a>. Being an order of sonship wherein one of their own number functioned as co-ordinate creator, Melchizedeks are in constitution partly of self-origin and therefore candidates for the realization of a supernal type of self-government. They periodically elect their own administrative chief for a term of seven years of standard time and otherwise function as a self-regulating order, though the original <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> does exercise certain inherent coparental prerogatives. From time to time this Father Melchizedek designates certain individuals of his order to function as special <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> to the midsonite worlds, a type of inhabited planet not heretofore revealed on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p1_4">35:1.4</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks do not function extensively outside the local universe except when they are called as witnesses in matters pending before the tribunals of the superuniverse, and when designated special <a href="/en/topic/ambassadors">ambassadors</a>, as they sometimes are, representing one universe to another in the same superuniverse. The original or first-born Melchizedek of each universe is always at liberty to journey to the neighboring universes or to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> on missions having to do with the interests and duties of his order.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. THE MELCHIZEDEK SONS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_1">35:2.1</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks are <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> order of divine Sons to approach sufficiently near the lower creature life to be able to function directly in the ministry of mortal uplift, to serve the evolutionary races without the necessity of incarnation. These Sons are naturally at the mid-point of the great personality descent, by origin being just about midway between the highest Divinity and the lowest creature life of will endowment. They thus become the natural intermediaries between the higher and divine levels of living existence and the lower, even the material, forms of life on the evolutionary worlds. The seraphic orders, the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, delight to work with the Melchizedeks; in fact, all forms of intelligent life find in these Sons understanding friends, sympathetic teachers, and wise counselors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_2">35:2.2</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks are a self-governing order. With this unique group we encounter the first attempt at self-determination on the part of local universe beings and observe the highest type of true self-government. These Sons organize their own machinery for their group and home-planet administration, as well as that for the six associated spheres and their tributary worlds. And it should be recorded that they have never abused their prerogatives; not once throughout all the superuniverse of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a> have these <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedek Sons</a> ever betrayed their trust. They are the hope of every universe group which aspires to self-government; they are the pattern and the teachers of self-government to all the spheres of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. All orders of intelligent beings, superiors from above and subordinates from below, are wholehearted in their praise of the government of the Melchizedeks.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_3">35:2.3</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedek order of sonship occupies the position, and assumes the responsibility, of the eldest son in a large family. Most of their work is regular and somewhat routine, but much of it is voluntary and altogether self-imposed. A majority of the special assemblies which, from time to time, convene on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> are called on motion of the Melchizedeks. On their own initiative these Sons patrol their native universe. They maintain an autonomous organization devoted to universe intelligence, making periodical reports to the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> independent of all information coming up to universe headquarters through the regular agencies concerned with the routine administration of the realm. They are by nature unprejudiced observers; they have the full confidence of all classes of intelligent beings.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_4">35:2.4</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks function as mobile and advisory review courts of the realms; these universe Sons go in small groups to the worlds to serve as advisory commissions, to take <a href="/en/topic/depositions">depositions</a>, to receive suggestions, and to act as counselors, thus helping to compose the major difficulties and settle the serious differences which arise from time to time in the affairs of the evolutionary domains.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_5">35:2.5</a></small></sup>  These eldest Sons of a universe are the chief aids of the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a> in carrying out the mandates of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>. When a <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> goes to a remote world in the name of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, he may, for the purposes of that particular mission, be deputized in the name of the sender and in that event will appear on the planet of assignment with the full authority of the Bright and Morning Star. Especially is this true on those spheres where a higher Son has not yet appeared in the likeness of the creatures of the realm.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_6">35:2.6</a></small></sup>  When a Creator Son enters upon the bestowal career on an evolutionary world, he goes alone; but when one of his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> brothers, an Avonal Son, enters upon a bestowal, he is accompanied by the Melchizedek supporters, twelve in number, who so efficiently contribute to the success of the bestowal mission. They also support the Paradise Avonals on magisterial missions to the inhabited worlds, and in these assignments the Melchizedeks are visible to mortal eyes if the Avonal Son is also thus manifest.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_7">35:2.7</a></small></sup>  There is no phase of planetary spiritual need to which they do not minister. They are the teachers who so often win whole worlds of advanced life to the final and full recognition of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and his Paradise Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_8">35:2.8</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks are well-nigh perfect in wisdom, but they are not infallible in judgment. When detached and alone on planetary missions, they have sometimes erred in minor matters, that is, they have elected to do certain things which their supervisors did not subsequently approve. Such an error of judgment temporarily disqualifies a <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> until he goes to <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and, in audience with the Creator Son, receives that instruction which effectually purges him of the disharmony which caused disagreement with his fellows; and then, following the <a href="/en/topic/correctional_rest">correctional rest</a>, reinstatement to service ensues on the third day. But these minor misadaptations in Melchizedek function have rarely occurred in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_9">35:2.9</a></small></sup>  These Sons are not an increasing order; their number is stationary, although varying in each local universe. The number of Melchizedeks of record on their headquarters planet in Nebadon is upward of ten million.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. THE MELCHIZEDEK WORLDS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_1">35:3.1</a></small></sup>  The Melchizedeks occupy a world of their own near <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, the universe headquarters. This sphere, by name <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, is the pilot world of the Salvington circuit of seventy primary spheres, each of which is encircled by six tributary spheres devoted to specialized activities. These marvelous spheres‚Äîseventy primaries and 420 tributaries‚Äîare often spoken of as the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_University">Melchizedek University</a>. Ascending <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> from all the constellations of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> pass through training on all 490 worlds in the acquirement of residential status on Salvington. But the <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> of <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> is only one phase of the manifold activities taking place on the Salvington cluster of architectural spheres.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_2">35:3.2</a></small></sup>  The 490 spheres of the Salvington circuit are divided into ten groups, each containing seven primary and forty-two tributary spheres. Each of these groups is under the general supervision of some one of the major orders of universe life. The first group, embracing the pilot world and the next six primary spheres in the encircling planetary procession, is under the supervision of the Melchizedeks. These <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">Melchizedek worlds</a> are:</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_3">35:3.3</a></small></sup>  1. The pilot world‚Äîthe home world of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedek Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_4">35:3.4</a></small></sup>  2. The world of the physical-life schools and the laboratories of living energies.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_5">35:3.5</a></small></sup>  3. The world of morontia life.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_6">35:3.6</a></small></sup>  4. The sphere of initial spirit life.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_7">35:3.7</a></small></sup>  5. The world of mid-spirit life.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_8">35:3.8</a></small></sup>  6. The sphere of advancing spirit life.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_9">35:3.9</a></small></sup>  7. The domain of co-ordinate and supreme self-realization.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_10">35:3.10</a></small></sup>  The six tributary worlds of each of these <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> spheres are devoted to activities germane to the work of the associated primary sphere.</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_11">35:3.11</a></small></sup>  The pilot world, the sphere <i>Melchizedek,</i> is the common meeting ground for all beings who are engaged in educating and spiritualizing the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> of time and space. To an ascender this world is probably the most interesting place in all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. All evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who graduate from their constellation training are destined to land on Melchizedek, where they are initiated into the regime of the disciplines and spirit progression of the <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> educational system. And never will you forget your reactions to <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> day of life on this unique world, not even after you have reached your <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> destination.</p>
<p id="p3_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_12">35:3.12</a></small></sup>  Ascending mortals maintain residence on the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> world while pursuing their training on the six encircling planets of specialized <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a>. And this same method is adhered to throughout their sojourn on the seventy cultural worlds, the primary spheres of the Salvington circuit.</p>
<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_13">35:3.13</a></small></sup>  Many diverse activities occupy the time of the numerous beings who reside on the six tributary worlds of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_sphere">Melchizedek sphere</a>, but as concerns the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>, these satellites are devoted to the following special phases of study:</p>
<p id="p3_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_14">35:3.14</a></small></sup>  1. Sphere number one is occupied with the review of the initial planetary life of the ascending mortals. This work is carried on in classes composed of those who hail from a given world of mortal origin. Those from <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> pursue such an experiential review together.</p>
<p id="p3_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_15">35:3.15</a></small></sup>  2. The special work of sphere number two consists in a similar review of the experiences passed through on the mansion worlds encircling the premier satellite of the local system headquarters.</p>
<p id="p3_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_16">35:3.16</a></small></sup>  3. The reviews of this sphere pertain to the sojourn on the capital of the local system and embrace the activities of the remainder of the architectural worlds of the system headquarters cluster.</p>
<p id="p3_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_17">35:3.17</a></small></sup>  4. The fourth sphere is occupied with a review of the experiences of the seventy tributary worlds of the constellation and of their associated spheres.</p>
<p id="p3_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_18">35:3.18</a></small></sup>  5. On the fifth sphere there is conducted the review of the ascendant sojourn on the constellation headquarters world.</p>
<p id="p3_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_19">35:3.19</a></small></sup>  6. The time on sphere number six is devoted to an attempt to correlate these five epochs and thus achieve co-ordination of experience preparatory to entering the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> primary schools of universe training.</p>
<p id="p3_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_20">35:3.20</a></small></sup>  The schools of universe administration and spiritual wisdom are located on the Melchizedek home world, where also are to be found those schools devoted to a single line of research, such as energy, matter, organization, <a href="/en/topic/communication">communication</a>, records, ethics, and comparative creature existence.</p>
<p id="p3_21"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_21">35:3.21</a></small></sup>  In the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_College_of_Spiritual_Endowment">Melchizedek College of Spiritual Endowment</a> all orders‚Äîeven the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> orders‚Äîof the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> co-operate with the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> and the seraphic teachers in training the hosts who go forth as <a href="/en/topic/evangels_of_destiny">evangels of destiny</a>, proclaiming spiritual liberty and divine sonship even to the remote worlds of the universe. This particular school of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_University">Melchizedek University</a> is an exclusive universe institution; <a href="/en/topic/student_visitors">student visitors</a> are not received from other realms.</p>
<p id="p3_22"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_22">35:3.22</a></small></sup>  The highest course of training in universe administration is given by the Melchizedeks on their home world. This <a href="/en/topic/College_of_High_Ethics">College of High Ethics</a> is presided over by the original <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a>. It is to these schools that the various universes send exchange students. While the young universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> stands low in the scale of universes as regards spiritual achievement and high ethical development, nevertheless, our administrative troubles have so turned the whole universe into a vast clinic for other near-by creations that the Melchizedek colleges are thronged with student visitors and observers from other realms. Besides the immense group of local registrants there are always upward of one hundred thousand foreign students in attendance upon the Melchizedek schools, for the order of Melchizedeks in Nebadon is renowned throughout all <a href="/en/topic/Splandon">Splandon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. SPECIAL WORK OF THE MELCHIZEDEKS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p4_1">35:4.1</a></small></sup>  A highly specialized branch of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> activities has to do with the supervision of the progressive morontia career of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>. Much of this training is conducted by the patient and wise seraphic ministers, assisted by <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who have ascended to relatively higher levels of universe attainment, but all of this educational work is under the general supervision of the Melchizedeks in association with the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p4_2">35:4.2</a></small></sup>  While the Melchizedek orders are chiefly devoted to the vast educational system and experiential training regime of the local universe, they also function in unique assignments and in unusual circumstances. In an evolving universe eventually embracing approximately ten million inhabited worlds, many things out of the ordinary are destined to happen, and it is in such emergencies that the Melchizedeks act.

They are more generally known as <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a> because a Son of this order is uniformly found at the head of each constellation government in every local universe.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p5_2">35:5.2</a></small></sup>  The number of Vorondadeks varies in each local universe, just one million being the recorded number in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. These Sons, like their co-ordinates, the Melchizedeks, possess no power of reproduction. There exists no known method whereby they can increase their numbers.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p5_3">35:5.3</a></small></sup>  In many respects these Sons are a self-governing body; as individuals and as groups, even as a whole, they are largely self-determinative, much as are the Melchizedeks, but Vorondadeks do not function through such a wide range of activities. They do not equal their <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> brethren in brilliant versatility, but they are even more reliable and efficient as rulers and farseeing administrators. Neither are they quite the administrative peers of their subordinates, the Lanonandek <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a>, but they excel all orders of universe sonship in stability of purpose and in divinity of judgment.</p>

<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p9_3">35:9.3</a></small></sup>  When System Sovereigns or assistants are recalled, their places are filled by selections made by the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Lanonandek_councils">supreme council</a> located on the constellation headquarters from the reserves of that order, a group which is larger on <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> than the average indicated.</p>

Of this entire number of failures only three were System Sovereigns; practically all of these Sons belonged to the second and third orders, Planetary Princes and tertiary Lanonandeks.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p9_7">35:9.7</a></small></sup>  The large number of these Sons who have lapsed from integrity does not indicate any fault in creatorship.

I do not make this observation by way of criticism. The Creator of our universe has full authority and power to do this. It is the contention of our high rulers that, while such free-choosing Sons make excessive trouble in the earlier ages of the universe, when things are fully sifted and finally settled, the gains of higher loyalty and fuller volitional service on the part of these thoroughly tested Sons will far more than compensate for the confusion and tribulations of earlier times.</p>

<p id="p10_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p10_2">35:10.2</a></small></sup>  These administrative schools of the local universe are supervised by a corps of <a href="/en/topic/Lanonandek_Sons">Lanonandek Sons</a> who have had long experience as <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a> and as constellation counselors. These executive colleges are excelled only by the administrative schools of <a href="/en/topic/Ensa">Ensa</a>.</p>
<p id="p10_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p10_3">35:10.3</a></small></sup>  While serving as training spheres for <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>, the Lanonandek worlds are the centers for extensive undertakings having to do with the normal and routine administrative operations of the universe. All the way in to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> pursue their studies in the practical schools of applied knowledge‚Äîactual training in really doing the things they are being taught. The universe educational system sponsored by the Melchizedeks is practical, progressive, meaningful, and experiential. It embraces training in things material, intellectual, morontial, and spiritual.</p>
<p id="p10_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p10_4">35:10.4</a></small></sup>  It is in connection with these administrative spheres of the Lanonandeks that most of the salvaged Sons of that order serve as custodians and directors of planetary affairs. And these defaulting <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> and their associates in <a href="/en/topic/rebellion_(spiritual)">rebellion</a> who choose to accept the proffered rehabilitation will continue to serve in these routine capacities, at least until the universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> is settled in light and life.</p>
<p id="p10_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p10_5">35:10.5</a></small></sup>  Many of the <a href="/en/topic/Lanonandek_Sons">Lanonandek Sons</a> in the older systems, however, have established wonderful records of service, administration, and spiritual achievement. They are a noble, faithful, and loyal group, notwithstanding their tendency to fall into error through fallacies of personal <a href="/en/topic/liberty">liberty</a> and fictions of <a href="/en/topic/self-determination">self-determination</a>.</p>
