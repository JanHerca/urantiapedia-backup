<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_1">31:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Corps of Mortal Finaliters</a> represents the present known destination of the ascending <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster-fused_mortals">Adjuster-fused mortals</a> of time. But there are other groups who are also assigned to this corps. The primary <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a> is composed of the following:</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_2">31:0.2</a></small></sup>  1. <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> Natives.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_3">31:0.3</a></small></sup>  2. <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_4">31:0.4</a></small></sup>  3. Glorified Mortals.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_5">31:0.5</a></small></sup>  4. Adopted Seraphim.</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_6">31:0.6</a></small></sup>  5. Glorified <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_7">31:0.7</a></small></sup>  6. Glorified Midway Creatures.</p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_8">31:0.8</a></small></sup>  These six groups of glorified beings compose this unique body of eternal destiny. We think we know their future work, but we are not certain. While the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Corps of the Mortal Finality</a> is mobilizing on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, and while they now so extensively minister to the universes of space and administer the worlds settled in light and life, their future destination must be the now-organizing universes of outer space. At least that is the conjecture of <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_9">31:0.9</a></small></sup>  The corps is organized in accordance with the working associations of the worlds of space and in keeping with the associative experience acquired throughout the long and eventful <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant career</a>. All the ascendant creatures admitted to this corps are received in equality, but this exalted equality in no way abrogates individuality or destroys personal identity. We can immediately discern, in communicating with a <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a>, whether he is an ascendant mortal, <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> native, adopted <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>, midway creature, or Material Son.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_10">31:0.10</a></small></sup>  During the present universe age the finaliters return to serve in the universes of time. They are assigned to labor successively in the different superuniverses and never in their native superuniverses until after they have served in all the other six supercreations. Thus may they acquire the sevenfold concept of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being.</p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_11">31:0.11</a></small></sup>  One or more companies of the mortal <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> are constantly in service on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. There is no domain of universe service to which they are not assigned; they function universally and with alternating and equal periods of assigned duty and free service.</p>
<p id="p0_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_12">31:0.12</a></small></sup>  We have no idea as to the nature of the future organization of this extraordinary group, but the finaliters are now wholly a self-governing body. They choose their own permanent, periodic, and assignment leaders and directors. No outside influence can ever be brought to bear upon their policies, and their oath of allegiance is only to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_13">31:0.13</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> maintain their own headquarters on Paradise, in the superuniverses, in the local universes, and on all the divisional capitals. They are a separate order of evolutionary creation. We do not directly manage them or control them, and yet they are absolutely loyal and always co-operative with all our plans. They are indeed the accumulating tried and true souls of time and space—the evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/salt">salt</a> of the universe—and they are forever proof against evil and secure against sin.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE HAVONA NATIVES </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p1_1">31:1.1</a></small></sup>  Many of the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> who serve as teachers in the pilgrim-training schools of the central universe become greatly attached to the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> and still more intrigued with the future work and destiny of the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Corps of Mortal Finaliters</a>. On <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> there is maintained, at the administrative headquarters of the corps, a registry for <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> volunteers presided over by the associate of <a href="/en/topic/Grandfanda">Grandfanda</a>. Today, you will find millions upon millions of Havona natives upon this waiting list. These perfect beings of direct and divine creation are of great assistance to the Mortal Corps of Finality, and they will undoubtedly be of even greater service in the far-distant future. They provide the viewpoint of one born in perfection and divine repleteness. The <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> thus embrace both phases of experiential existence—perfect and perfected.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p1_2">31:1.2</a></small></sup>  Havona natives must achieve certain experiential developments in liaison with evolutionary beings which will create reception capacity for the bestowal of a fragment of the spirit of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. The Mortal Finaliter Corps has as permanent members only such beings as have been fused with the spirit of the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>, or who, like the <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a>, innately embody this spirit of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Father">God the Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p1_3">31:1.3</a></small></sup>  The inhabitants of the central universe are received into the corps in the ratio of one in a thousand—a <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> company. The corps is organized for temporary service in companies of one thousand, the ascendant creatures numbering 997 to one <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> native and one Gravity Messenger. Finaliters are thus mobilized in companies, but the finality oath is administered individually. It is an oath of sweeping implications and eternal import. The Havona native takes the same oath and becomes forever attached to the corps.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p1_4">31:1.4</a></small></sup>  The Havona recruits follow the company of their assignment; wherever the group goes, they go. And you should see their enthusiasm in the new work of the finaliters. The possibility of attaining the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a> is one of the superb thrills of Havona; the possibility of becoming a finaliter is one of the supreme adventures of these perfect races.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p1_5">31:1.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a> are also received, in the same ratio, into the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Conjoint_Trinitized_Finaliters">Corps of Conjoint Trinitized Finaliters</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Vicegerington">Vicegerington</a> and into the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Transcendental_Finaliters">Corps of Transcendental Finaliters</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> citizens regard these three destinies as constituting the supreme goals of their supernal careers, together with their possible admission to the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Havona_Finaliters">Corps of Havona Finaliters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. GRAVITY MESSENGERS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p2_1">31:2.1</a></small></sup>  Wherever and whenever <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a> are functioning, the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> are in command. All Gravity Messengers are under the exclusive jurisdiction of <a href="/en/topic/Grandfanda">Grandfanda</a>, and they are assigned only to the primary <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>. They are invaluable to the finaliters even now, and they will be all-serviceable in the eternal future. No other group of intelligent creatures possesses such a personalized <a href="/en/topic/messenger_corps_(Lanonandek)">messenger corps</a> able to transcend time and space. Similar types of messenger-recorders attached to other <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a> are not personalized; they are <a href="/en/topic/absonity">absonitized</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p2_2">31:2.2</a></small></sup>  Gravity Messengers hail from <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a>, and they are modified and personalized Adjusters, but no one of our <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> group will undertake to explain the nature of one of these <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>. We know they are highly personal beings, divine, intelligent, and touchingly understanding, but we do not comprehend their timeless technique of traversing space. They seem to be competent to utilize any and all energies, circuits, and even gravity. Finaliters of the mortal corps cannot defy time and space, but they have associated with them and subject to their command all but infinite spirit personalities who can. We presume to call Gravity Messengers personalities, but in reality they are superspirit beings, unlimited and boundless personalities. They are of an entirely different order of personality as compared with <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p2_3">31:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a> may be attached to a <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> company in unlimited numbers, but only one messenger, the chief of his fellows, is mustered into the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Mortal Corps of the Finality</a>. This chief however has assigned to him a permanent staff of 999 fellow messengers, and as occasion may require, he may call upon the reserves of the order for assistants in unlimited numbers.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p2_4">31:2.4</a></small></sup>  Gravity Messengers and glorified mortal finaliters achieve a touching and profound affection for one another; they have much in common: One is a direct personalization of a fragment of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, the other a creature personality existent in the surviving immortal soul fused with a fragment of the same Universal Father, the spirit Thought Adjuster.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. GLORIFIED MORTALS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_1">31:3.1</a></small></sup>  Ascendant <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster-fused_mortals">Adjuster-fused mortals</a> compose the bulk of the primary <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>. Together with the adopted and glorified <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> they usually constitute 990 in each finaliter company. The proportion of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> and <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> in any one group varies, though the mortals far outnumber the seraphim. The <a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a>, glorified <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>, glorified midway creatures, the <a href="/en/topic/Gravity_Messengers">Gravity Messengers</a>, and the unknown and missing member make up only one per cent of the corps; each company of one thousand <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> has places for just ten of these nonmortal and nonseraphic personalities.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_2">31:3.2</a></small></sup>  We of <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> do not know the “finality destiny” of the ascendant mortals of time. At present they reside on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and temporarily serve in the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Light_and_Life">Corps of Light and Life</a>, but such a tremendous course of ascendant training and such lengthy universe discipline must be designed to qualify them for even greater tests of trust and more sublime services of responsibility.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_3">31:3.3</a></small></sup>  Notwithstanding that these ascendant <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> have attained Paradise, have been mustered into the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>, and have been sent back in large numbers to participate in the conduct of local universes and to assist in the administration of superuniverse affairs—in the face of even this <i>apparent</i> destiny, there remains the significant fact that they are of record as only sixth-stage <a href="/en/topic/spirits">spirits</a>. There undoubtedly remains one more step in the career of the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Mortal Corps of the Finality</a>. We do not know the nature of that step, but we have taken cognizance of, and here call attention to, three facts:</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_4">31:3.4</a></small></sup>  1. We know from the records that mortals are spirits of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> order during their sojourn in the <a href="/en/topic/minor_sectors">minor sectors</a>, and that they advance to the second order when translated to the <a href="/en/topic/major_sectors">major sectors</a>, and to the third when they go forward to the central training worlds of the superuniverse. Mortals become quartan or graduate spirits after reaching the sixth circle of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and become spirits of the fifth order when they find the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. They subsequently attain the sixth stage of spirit existence upon taking the oath that musters them forever into the eternity assignment of the Corps of the Mortal Finality.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_5">31:3.5</a></small></sup>  We observe that spirit classification, or designation, has been determined by actual advancement from one realm of universe service to another realm of universe service or from one universe to another universe; and we surmise that the bestowal of seventh-spirit classification upon the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Mortal Corps of the Finality</a> will be simultaneous with their advancement to eternal assignment for service on hitherto unrecorded and unrevealed spheres and concomitant with their attainment of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Supreme">God the Supreme</a>. But aside from these bold conjectures, we really know no more about all this than you do; our knowledge of the mortal career does not go beyond present <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> destiny.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_6">31:3.6</a></small></sup>  2. The mortal <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> have fully complied with the <a href="/en/topic/commandments">injunction</a> of the ages, “Be you perfect”; they have ascended the universal path of mortal attainment; they have found God, and they have been duly inducted into the Corps of the Finality<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Such beings have attained the present limit of spirit progression but not <i>finality of ultimate spirit status.</i> They have achieved the present limit of creature <a href="/en/topic/perfection">perfection</a> but not <i>finality of creature service.</i> They have experienced the fullness of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> worship but not <i>finality of experiential Deity attainment.</i></p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_7">31:3.7</a></small></sup>  3. The glorified <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Corps of Finality are ascendant beings in possession of experiential knowledge of every step of the actuality and philosophy of the fullest possible life of intelligent existence, while during the ages of this ascent from the lowest material worlds to the spiritual heights of Paradise, these surviving creatures have been trained to the limits of their capacity respecting every detail of every divine principle of the just and efficient, as well as merciful and patient, administration of all the universal creation of time and space.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_8">31:3.8</a></small></sup>  We deem that human beings are entitled to share our opinions, and that you are free to conjecture with us respecting the mystery of the ultimate destiny of the Paradise Corps of Finality. It seems evident to us that the present assignments of the perfected evolutionary creatures partake of the nature of postgraduate courses in universe understanding and superuniverse administration; and we all ask, “Why should the Gods be so concerned in so thoroughly training surviving mortals in the technique of universe management?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. ADOPTED SERAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p4_1">31:4.1</a></small></sup>  Many of the faithful seraphic guardians of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> are permitted to go through the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant career</a> with their human wards, and many of these <a href="/en/topic/guardian_angels">guardian angels</a>, after becoming Father fused, join their subjects in taking the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> oath of eternity and forever accept the destiny of their mortal associates. Angels who pass through the ascending experience of mortal beings may share the destiny of human nature; they may equally and eternally be mustered into this <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>. Large numbers of the adopted and glorified <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> are attached to the various nonmortal <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. GLORIFIED MATERIAL SONS </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p5_1">31:5.1</a></small></sup>  There is provision in the universes of time and space whereby the Adamic citizens of the local systems, when long delayed in receiving planetary assignment, may initiate a petition for release from permanent-citizenship status. And if granted, they join the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> on the universe capitals and thence proceed onward to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p5_2">31:5.2</a></small></sup>  When an advanced evolutionary world attains the later eras of the age of light and life, the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>, the Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>, may elect to humanize, receive Adjusters, and embark upon the evolutionary course of universe ascent leading to the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Corps of Mortal Finaliters</a>. Certain of these Material Sons have partially failed or technically defaulted in their mission as biologic accelerators, as <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> did on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>; and then are they compelled to take the natural course of the peoples of the realm, receive Adjusters, pass through death, and progress by faith through the ascendant regime, subsequently attaining Paradise and the Corps of the Finality.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p5_3">31:5.3</a></small></sup>  These Material Sons are not to be found in many <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> companies. Their presence lends great potential to the possibilities of high service for such a group, and they are invariably chosen as its leaders. If both of the Edenic pair are attached to the same group, they are usually permitted to function jointly, as one personality. Such ascendant pairs are far more successful in the adventure of trinitizing than are the ascendant <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. GLORIFIED MIDWAY CREATURES </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p6_1">31:6.1</a></small></sup>  On many planets the midway creatures are produced in large numbers, but they seldom tarry on their native world subsequent to its being settled in light and life. Then, or soon thereafter, they are released from permanent-citizenship status and start on the ascension to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, passing through the morontia worlds, the superuniverse, and <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> in company with the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of time and space.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p6_2">31:6.2</a></small></sup>  The midway creatures from various universes differ greatly in origin and nature, but they are all destined to one or another of the Paradise finality corps. The secondary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> are all eventually Adjuster fused and are mustered into the mortal corps. Many <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> companies have one of these glorified beings in their group.</p>
<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. THE EVANGELS OF LIGHT </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p7_1">31:7.1</a></small></sup>  At the present time every <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> company numbers 999 personalities of oath status, permanent members.

But these beings are only transient members of the corps.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p7_2">31:7.2</a></small></sup>  Any celestial personality assigned to the service of any <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a> is denominated an Evangel of Light. These beings do not take the finaliter oath, and though subject to the corps organization they are not of permanent attachment. This group may embrace <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a>, or their trinitized offspring—any being required in the prosecution of a transient finaliter assignment. Whether or not the corps is to have these beings attached to the eternal mission, we do not know. At the conclusion of attachment these Evangels of Light resume their former status.</p>
