<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_1">6:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> is the perfect and final expression of the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù personal and absolute concept of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. Accordingly, whenever and however the Father personally and absolutely expresses himself, he does so through his Eternal Son, who ever has been, now is, and ever will be, the living and divine Word. And this Eternal Son is residential at the center of all things, in association with, and immediately enshrouding the personal presence of, the Eternal and Universal Father.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_2">6:0.2</a></small></sup>  We speak of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst‚Äù thought and allude to an impossible time origin of the Eternal Son for the purpose of gaining access to the thought channels of the human intellect. Such distortions of <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> represent our best efforts at contact-compromise with the time-bound minds of mortal creatures. In the sequential sense the Universal Father never could have had a first thought, nor could the Eternal Son ever have had a beginning. But I was instructed to portray the realities of <a href="/en/topic/eternity">eternity</a> to the time-limited minds of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> by such symbols of thought and to designate the relationships of eternity by such time concepts of sequentiality.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_3">6:0.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> is the spiritual personalization of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father‚Äôs universal and infinite concept of divine reality, unqualified spirit, and absolute personality. And thereby does the Son constitute the divine revelation of the creator identity of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. The perfect personality of the Son discloses that the Father is actually the eternal and universal source of all the meanings and values of the spiritual, the volitional, the purposeful, and the personal.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_4">6:0.4</a></small></sup>  In an effort to enable the finite <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> of time to form some sequential concept of the relationships of the eternal and infinite beings of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>, we utilize such license of conception as to refer to the ‚ÄúFather‚Äôs first personal, universal, and infinite concept.‚Äù It is impossible for me to convey to the human mind any adequate idea of the eternal relations of the Deities; therefore do I employ such terms as will afford the finite mind something of an idea of the relationship of these eternal beings in the subsequent eras of time. We believe the Son sprang from the Father; we are taught that both are unqualifiedly eternal. It is apparent, therefore, that no time creature can ever fully comprehend this mystery of a Son who is derived from the Father, and yet who is co-ordinately eternal with the Father himself.</p>

On <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a>, the headquarters of the superuniverse, we designate the Son as the Co-ordinate Spirit Center and as the Eternal Spirit Administrator. On <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, the headquarters of your local universe, this Son is of record as the Second Eternal Source and Center. The Melchizedeks speak of him as the Son of Sons.

<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. NATURE OF THE ETERNAL SON </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_1">6:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> is just as changeless and infinitely dependable as the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. He is also just as spiritual as the Father, just as truly an unlimited spirit. To you of lowly origin the Son would appear to be more personal since he is one step nearer you in approachability than is the Universal Father.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_2">6:2.2</a></small></sup>  The Eternal Son is the eternal Word of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. He is wholly like the Father; in fact, the Eternal Son <i>is</i> <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Father">God the Father</a> personally manifest to the universe of universes. And thus it was and is and forever will be true of the Eternal Son and of all the co-ordinate <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a>: ‚ÄúHe who has seen the Son has seen the Father<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_3">6:2.3</a></small></sup>  In nature the Son is wholly like the spirit Father. When we <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, actually we at the same time worship <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Son">God the Son</a> and <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Spirit">God the Spirit</a>. God the Son is just as divinely real and eternal in nature as God the Father.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_4">6:2.4</a></small></sup>  The Son not only possesses all the Father‚Äôs infinite and transcendent righteousness, but the Son is also reflective of all the Father‚Äôs holiness of character. The Son shares the Father‚Äôs perfection and jointly shares the responsibility of aiding all creatures of imperfection in their spiritual efforts to attain divine perfection.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_5">6:2.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> possesses all the Father‚Äôs character of divinity and attributes of spirituality. The Son <i>is</i> the fullness of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äôs absoluteness in personality and spirit, and these qualities the Son reveals in his personal management of the spiritual government of the universe of universes.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_6">6:2.6</a></small></sup>  God is, indeed, a universal spirit; God is spirit; and this spirit nature of the Father is focalized and personalized in the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> of the Eternal Son<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. In the Son all spiritual characteristics are apparently greatly enhanced by differentiation from the universality of the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>. And as the Father shares his spirit nature with the Son, so do they together just as fully and unreservedly share the divine spirit with the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_7">6:2.7</a></small></sup>  In the love of truth and in the creation of beauty the Father and the Son are equal except that the Son <i>appears</i> to devote himself more to the realization of the exclusively spiritual beauty of universal values.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p2_8">6:2.8</a></small></sup>  In divine goodness I discern no difference between the Father and the Son. The Father loves his universe children as a father; the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> looks upon all creatures both as father and as brother.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. MINISTRY OF THE FATHER‚ÄôS LOVE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p3_1">6:3.1</a></small></sup>  The Son shares the justice and righteousness of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> but overshadows these divinity traits by the infinite personalization of the Father‚Äôs <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> and mercy; the Son is the revelation of divine love to the universes. As <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is love, so the Son is mercy<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. The Son cannot love more than the Father, but he can show mercy to creatures in one additional way, for he not only is a primal creator like the Father, but he is also the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> of that same Father, thereby sharing in the sonship experience of all other sons of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p3_2">6:3.2</a></small></sup>  The Eternal Son is the great <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a> minister to all creation<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. Mercy is the essence of the Son‚Äôs spiritual character. The mandates of the Eternal Son, as they go forth over the spirit circuits of the <a href="/en/topic/Second_Source_and_Center">Second Source and Center</a>, are keyed in tones of mercy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p3_3">6:3.3</a></small></sup>  To comprehend the <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, you must first perceive its divine source, the Father, who <i>is</i> love, and then behold the unfolding of this infinite affection in the far-flung ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and his almost limitless host of ministering personalities<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p3_4">6:3.4</a></small></sup>  The ministry of the Eternal Son is devoted to the revelation of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of love to the universe of universes. This divine Son is not engaged in the ignoble task of trying to persuade his gracious Father to love his lowly creatures and to show mercy to the wrongdoers of time. How wrong to envisage the Eternal Son as appealing to the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> to show mercy to his lowly creatures on the material worlds of space! Such concepts of God are crude and grotesque. Rather should you realize that all the merciful ministrations of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> are a direct revelation of the Father‚Äôs heart of universal love and infinite compassion. The Father‚Äôs love is the real and eternal source of the Son‚Äôs mercy.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p3_5">6:3.5</a></small></sup>  God is <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a>, the Son is <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>. Mercy is applied love, the Father‚Äôs love in action in the person of his <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>. The love of this universal Son is likewise universal. As love is comprehended on a sex planet, the love of God is more comparable to the love of a father, while the love of the Eternal Son is more like the affection of a mother. Crude, indeed, are such illustrations, but I employ them in the hope of conveying to the human mind the thought that there is a difference, not in divine content but in quality and technique of expression, between the love of the Father and the love of the Son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. ATTRIBUTES OF THE ETERNAL SON </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_1">6:4.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> motivates the <a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a> level of cosmic reality; the spiritual power of the Son is absolute in relation to all universe actualities. He exercises perfect control over the interassociation of all undifferentiated spirit energy and over all actualized spirit reality through his absolute grasp of spirit <a href="/en/topic/gravity">gravity</a>. All pure unfragmented spirit and all spiritual beings and values are responsive to the infinite drawing power of the primal Son of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. And if the eternal future should witness the appearance of an unlimited universe, the spirit gravity and the spirit power of the <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> Son will be found wholly adequate for the spiritual control and effective administration of such a boundless creation.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_2">6:4.2</a></small></sup>  The Son is omnipotent only in the spiritual realm. In the eternal economy of universe administration, wasteful and needless repetition of function is never encountered; the Deities are not given to useless <a href="/en/topic/duplication">duplication</a> of universe ministry.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_3">6:4.3</a></small></sup>  The omnipresence of the <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> Son constitutes the <a href="/en/topic/spiritual_unity">spiritual unity</a> of the universe of universes. The spiritual cohesion of all creation rests upon the everywhere active presence of the divine spirit of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>. When we conceive of the Father‚Äôs spiritual presence, we find it difficult to differentiate it in our thinking from the spiritual presence of the Eternal Son. The spirit of the Father is eternally resident in the spirit of the Son.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_4">6:4.4</a></small></sup>  The Father must be spiritually omnipresent, but such omnipresence appears to be inseparable from the everywhere spirit activities of the Eternal Son. We do, however, believe that in all situations of Father-Son presence of a dual spiritual nature the spirit of the Son is co-ordinate with the spirit of the Father.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_5">6:4.5</a></small></sup>  In his contact with personality, the Father acts in the <a href="/en/topic/personality_circuit">personality circuit</a>. In his personal and detectable contact with spiritual creation, he appears in the fragments of the totality of his <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, and these <a href="/en/topic/Father_fragments">Father fragments</a> have a solitary, unique, and exclusive function wherever and whenever they appear in the universes. In all such situations the spirit of the Son is co-ordinate with the spiritual function of the fragmented presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_6">6:4.6</a></small></sup>  Spiritually the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> is omnipresent. The spirit of the Eternal Son is most certainly with you and around you, but not within you and a part of you like the Mystery Monitor. The indwelling Father fragment adjusts the human mind to progressively divine attitudes, whereupon such an ascending mind becomes increasingly responsive to the spiritual drawing power of the all-powerful spirit-gravity circuit of the <a href="/en/topic/Second_Source_and_Center">Second Source and Center</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_7">6:4.7</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> Son is universally and spiritually self-conscious. In wisdom the Son is the full equal of the Father. In the realms of knowledge, omniscience, we cannot distinguish between the First and Second Sources; like the Father, the Son knows all; he is never surprised by any universe event; he comprehends the <a href="/en/topic/end">end</a> from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_8">6:4.8</a></small></sup>  The Father and the Son really know the number and whereabouts of all the spirits and spiritualized beings in the universe of universes. Not only does the Son know all things by virtue of his own omnipresent spirit, but the Son, equally with the Father and the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>, is fully cognizant of the vast reflectivity intelligence of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being, which intelligence is at all times aware of all things that transpire on all the worlds of the seven superuniverses. And there are other ways in which the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Son is omniscient.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_9">6:4.9</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, as a loving, merciful, and ministering spiritual personality, is wholly and infinitely equal with the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, while in all those merciful and affectionate personal contacts with the ascendant beings of the lower realms the Eternal Son is just as kind and considerate, just as patient and long-suffering, as are his <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Paradise Sons</a> in the local universes who so frequently bestow themselves upon the evolutionary worlds of time.</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_10">6:4.10</a></small></sup>  It is needless further to expatiate on the attributes of the Eternal Son. With the exceptions noted, it is only necessary to study the spiritual attributes of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Father">God the Father</a> to understand and correctly evaluate the attributes of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Son">God the Son</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 5. LIMITATIONS OF THE ETERNAL SON </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_1">6:5.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> does not personally function in the physical domains, nor does he function, except through the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>, in the levels of mind ministry to creature beings. But these qualifications do not in any manner otherwise limit the Eternal Son in the full and free exercise of all the divine attributes of <i>spiritual</i> omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_2">6:5.2</a></small></sup>  The Eternal Son does not personally pervade the potentials of <a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a> inherent in the infinity of the <a href="/en/topic/Deity_Absolute">Deity Absolute</a>, but as these potentials become actual, they come within the all-powerful grasp of the spirit-gravity circuit of the Son.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_3">6:5.3</a></small></sup>  Personality is the exclusive gift of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> derives <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> from the Father, but he does not, without the Father, bestow personality. The Son gives origin to a vast spirit host, but such derivations are not personalities. When the Son creates personality, he does so in conjunction with the Father or with the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Creator">Conjoint Creator</a>, who may act for the Father in such relationships. The Eternal Son is thus a cocreator of personalities, but he bestows personality upon no being and of himself, alone, never creates personal beings. This limitation of action does not, however, deprive the Son of the ability to create any or all types of other-than-personal reality.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_4">6:5.4</a></small></sup>  The Eternal Son is limited in transmittal of creator prerogatives. The Father, in eternalizing the <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> Son, bestowed upon him the power and privilege of subsequently joining with the Father in the divine act of producing additional Sons possessing creative attributes, and this they have done and now do. But when these co-ordinate Sons have been produced, the prerogatives of creatorship are apparently not further transmissible. The Eternal Son transmits creatorship powers only to <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> or direct personalization. Therefore, when the Father and the Son unite to personalize a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, they achieve their purpose; but the Creator Son thus brought into existence is never able to transmit or delegate the prerogatives of creatorship to the various orders of Sons which he may subsequently create, notwithstanding that, in the highest local universe Sons, there does appear a very limited reflection of the creative attributes of a Creator Son.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_5">6:5.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, as an infinite and exclusively personal being, cannot fragmentize his nature, cannot distribute and bestow individualized portions of his selfhood upon other entities or persons as do the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. But the Son can and does bestow himself as an unlimited spirit to bathe all creation and unceasingly draw all spirit personalities and spiritual realities to himself.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p5_6">6:5.6</a></small></sup>  Ever remember, the Eternal Son is the personal portrayal of the spirit Father to all creation.

Mortal man perceives mind on the finite, cosmic, material, and personal levels. Man also observes mind phenomena in living organisms functioning on the subpersonal (animal) level, but it is difficult for him to grasp the nature of mind when associated with supermaterial beings and as a part of exclusive spirit personalities. Mind must, however, be differently defined when it refers to the spirit level of existence, and when it is used to denote spirit functions of intelligence. That kind of mind which is directly allied with spirit is comparable neither to that mind which co-ordinates spirit and matter nor to that mind which is allied only with matter.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p6_2">6:6.2</a></small></sup>  Spirit is ever conscious, minded, and possessed of varied phases of <a href="/en/topic/identity">identity</a>.

The Son is <i>absolute personality;</i> <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is <i>father personality‚Äî</i>the source of personality, the bestower of personality, the cause of personality.

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p8_1">6:8.1</a></small></sup>  Concerning identity, nature, and other attributes of personality, the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> is the full equal, the perfect complement, and the eternal counterpart of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. In the same sense that <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is the Universal Father, the Son is the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Mother">Universal Mother</a>.

<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p8_2">6:8.2</a></small></sup>  To appreciate the character of the Son, you should study the revelation of the divine character of the Father; they are forever and inseparably one. As divine personalities they are virtually indistinguishable by the lower orders of intelligence. They are not so difficult of separate recognition by those whose origin is in the creative acts of the Deities themselves. Beings of nativity in the central universe and on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> discern the Father and the Son not only as one personal unity of universal control but also as two separate personalities functioning in definite domains of universe administration.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup></p>

But as you ascend in the Paradise path of spiritual progression, the personality of the Eternal Son will become increasingly real to you, and the reality of his infinitely spiritual mind will become more discernible to your progressively spiritualizing mind.</p>
