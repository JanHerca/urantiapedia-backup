<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p0_1">142:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE month of April <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles worked in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, going out of the city each evening to spend the night at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Jesus himself spent one or two nights each week in Jerusalem at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a>, a <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> Jew, where many prominent <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> came in secret to interview him.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p0_2">142:0.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">first day</a> in Jerusalem Jesus called upon his friend of former years, <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, the onetime high priest and relative of <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s wife. Annas had been hearing about Jesus and his teachings, and when Jesus called at the high priest’s home, he was received with much reserve. When Jesus perceived Annas’s coldness, he took immediate leave, saying as he departed: “<a href="/en/topic/fear">Fear</a> is man’s chief enslaver and <a href="/en/topic/pride">pride</a> his great weakness; will you betray yourself into bondage to both of these destroyers of joy and liberty?” But Annas made no reply. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> did not again see Annas until the time when he sat with his son-in-law in judgment on the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_1">142:1.1</a></small></sup>  Throughout this month <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> or one of the apostles taught daily in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>. When the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> crowds were too great to find entrance to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> teaching, the apostles conducted many teaching groups outside the sacred precincts. The burden of their message was:</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_2">142:1.2</a></small></sup>  1. The kingdom of heaven is at hand<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_3">142:1.3</a></small></sup>  2. By faith in the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> you may enter the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>, thus becoming the sons of God<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_4">142:1.4</a></small></sup>  3. Love is the rule of living within the kingdom—supreme devotion to God while loving your neighbor as yourself<sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_5">142:1.5</a></small></sup>  4. Obedience to the will of the Father, yielding the fruits of the spirit in one’s personal life, is the law of the kingdom<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_6">142:1.6</a></small></sup>  The multitudes who came to celebrate the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> heard this teaching of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and hundreds of them rejoiced in the good news<sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>. The chief priests and rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> became much concerned about Jesus and his apostles and debated among themselves as to what should be done with them.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p1_7">142:1.7</a></small></sup>  Besides teaching in and about the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>, the apostles and other believers were engaged in doing much personal work among the Passover throngs. These interested men and women carried the news of Jesus’ message from this Passover celebration to the uttermost parts of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> and also to the East. This was the beginning of the spread of the gospel of the kingdom to the outside world. No longer was the work of Jesus to be confined to <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. GOD’S WRATH </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p2_1">142:2.1</a></small></sup>  There was in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in attendance upon the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> festivities one <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>, a wealthy Jewish trader from <a href="/en/topic/Crete">Crete</a>, and he came to <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> making request to see <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> privately. Andrew arranged this secret meeting with Jesus at <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a>’s home the evening of the next day. This man could not comprehend the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings, and he came because he desired to inquire more fully about the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Said <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a> to Jesus: “But, Rabbi, <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> and the olden prophets tell us that <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> is a jealous God, a God of great <a href="/en/topic/wrath">wrath</a> and fierce <a href="/en/topic/anger">anger</a>. The prophets say he hates evildoers and takes vengeance on those who obey not his law. You and your disciples teach us that God is a kind and compassionate Father who so loves all men that he would welcome them into this new kingdom of heaven, which you proclaim is so near at hand<sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p2_2">142:2.2</a></small></sup>  When Jacob finished speaking, Jesus replied: “Jacob, you have well stated the teachings of the olden <a href="/en/topic/prophets">prophets</a> who taught the children of their generation in accordance with the light of their day. Our Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> is changeless. But the concept of his nature has enlarged and grown from the days of Moses down through the times of <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a> and even to the generation of the prophet <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a>. And now have I come in the flesh to reveal the Father in new glory and to show forth his love and mercy to all men on all worlds. As the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of this kingdom shall spread over the world with its message of good cheer and good will to all men, there will grow up improved and better relations among the families of all nations. As time passes, fathers and their children will love each other more, and thus will be brought about a better understanding of the love of the Father in heaven for his children on earth. Remember, Jacob, that a good and true father not only loves his <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> as a whole—as a family—but he also truly loves and affectionately cares for each <i>individual</i> member.”</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p2_3">142:2.3</a></small></sup>  After considerable discussion of the heavenly Father’s character, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> paused to say: “You, <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>, being a father of many, know well the truth of my words.” And <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a> said: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, who told you I was the father of six children? How did you know this about me?” And the Master replied: “Suffice it to say that the Father and the Son know all things, for indeed they see all. Loving your children as a father on earth, you must now accept as a reality the love of the heavenly Father for <i>you—</i>not just for all the children of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>, but for you, your individual soul.”</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p2_4">142:2.4</a></small></sup>  Then Jesus went on to say: “When your <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a> are very young and immature, and when you must chastise them, they may reflect that their father is <a href="/en/topic/anger">angry</a> and filled with resentful <a href="/en/topic/wrath">wrath</a>. Their immaturity cannot penetrate beyond the <a href="/en/topic/punishment">punishment</a> to discern the father’s farseeing and corrective affection. But when these same children become grown-up men and women, would it not be folly for them to cling to these earlier and misconceived notions regarding their father? As men and women they should now discern their father’s love in all these early disciplines. And should not mankind, as the centuries pass, come the better to understand the true nature and loving character of the Father in heaven? What profit have you from successive generations of spiritual illumination if you persist in viewing <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> and the prophets saw him? I say to you, Jacob, under the bright light of this hour you should see the Father as none of those who have gone before ever beheld him. And thus seeing him, you should rejoice to enter the kingdom wherein such a merciful Father rules, and you should seek to have his will of love dominate your life henceforth.”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p2_5">142:2.5</a></small></sup>  And <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> answered: “Rabbi, I believe; I desire that you lead me into the Father’s kingdom.”</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE CONCEPT OF GOD </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_1">142:3.1</a></small></sup>  The twelve apostles, most of whom had listened to this discussion of the character of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, that night asked <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> many questions about the Father in heaven. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s answers to these questions can best be presented by the following summary in modern phraseology:</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_2">142:3.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus mildly upbraided the twelve, in substance saying: Do you not know the traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> relating to the growth of the idea of <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, and are you ignorant of the teaching of the Scriptures concerning the doctrine of God? And then did the Master proceed to instruct the apostles about the evolution of the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> throughout the course of the development of the Jewish people. He called attention to the following phases of the growth of the God idea:</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_3">142:3.3</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Yahweh—</i>the god of the Sinai clans<sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>. This was the primitive concept of Deity which <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> exalted to the higher level of the <a href="/en/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a>. The Father in heaven never fails to accept the sincere <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> of his children on earth, no matter how crude their concept of Deity or by what name they symbolize his divine nature.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_4">142:3.4</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a>.</i> This concept of the Father in heaven was proclaimed by <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> and was carried far from <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> by those who subsequently believed in this enlarged and expanded idea of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. Abraham and his brother left <a href="/en/topic/Ur">Ur</a> because of the establishment of sun worship, and they became believers in Melchizedek’s teaching of <a href="/en/topic/El_Elyon">El Elyon</a>—the Most High God<sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>. Theirs was a composite concept of God, consisting in a blending of their older Mesopotamian ideas and the Most High doctrine.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_5">142:3.5</a></small></sup>  3. <i><a href="/en/topic/El_Shaddai">El Shaddai</a><sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>.</i> During these early days many of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> worshiped El Shaddai, the Egyptian concept of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of heaven, which they learned about during their captivity in the land of the Nile. Long after the times of Melchizedek all three of these concepts of God became joined together to form the doctrine of the creator Deity, the <a href="/en/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_6">142:3.6</a></small></sup>  4. <i><a href="/en/topic/Elohim">Elohim</a><sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup>.</i> From the times of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> the teaching of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> has persisted. Do you not recall how the Scriptures begin by asserting that “In the beginning the Gods created the heavens and the earth”? This indicates that when that record was made the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> concept of three Gods in one had found lodgment in the religion of our forebears.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_7">142:3.7</a></small></sup>  5. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>.</i> By the times of <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a> these beliefs about <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> had expanded into the concept of a <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Creator">Universal Creator</a> who was simultaneously all-powerful and all-merciful<sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup>. And this evolving and enlarging concept of God virtually supplanted all previous ideas of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> in our fathers’ religion.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_8">142:3.8</a></small></sup>  6. <i>The Father in heaven<sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup>.</i> And now do we know God as our Father in heaven. Our teaching provides a religion wherein the believer <i>is</i> a son of God. That is the good news of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom of heaven. Coexistent with the Father are the Son and the Spirit, and the revelation of the nature and ministry of these <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Deities">Paradise Deities</a> will continue to enlarge and brighten throughout the endless ages of the eternal spiritual progression of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_sons_of_God">ascending sons of God</a>. At all times and during all ages the true <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> of any human being—as concerns individual spiritual progress—is recognized by the indwelling spirit as homage rendered to the Father in heaven.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_9">142:3.9</a></small></sup>  Never before had the apostles been so shocked as they were upon hearing this recounting of the growth of the concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in the Jewish minds of previous generations; they were too bewildered to ask questions. As they sat before <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in silence, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> continued: “And you would have known these truths had you read the Scriptures. Have you not read in <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> where it says: ‘And the anger of the Lord was kindled against <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, so much so that he moved <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> against them, saying, go number Israel and <a href="/en/topic/Judah">Judah</a>’? And this was not strange because in the days of Samuel the children of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> really believed that <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> created both good and evil. But when a later writer narrated these events, subsequent to the enlargement of the Jewish concept of the nature of God, he did not dare attribute evil to Yahweh; therefore he said: ‘And <a href="/en/topic/Satan">Satan</a> stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel.’ Cannot you discern that such records in the Scriptures clearly show how the concept of the nature of God continued to grow from one generation to another?<sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_10">142:3.10</a></small></sup>  “Again should you have discerned the growth of the understanding of divine law in perfect keeping with these enlarging concepts of divinity. When the children of Israel came out of <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> in the days before the enlarged revelation of Yahweh, they had ten <a href="/en/topic/commandments">commandments</a> which served as their law right up to the times when they were encamped before Sinai. And these ten commandments were:</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_11">142:3.11</a></small></sup>  “1. You shall worship no other god, for the Lord is a jealous <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_1">142:4.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> Jew, was a <a href="/en/topic/proselyte">proselyte</a> of the gate, having been neither circumcised nor baptized; and since he was a great lover of the beautiful in art and sculpture, the house which he occupied when sojourning in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was a beautiful edifice. This home was exquisitely adorned with priceless treasures which he had gathered up here and there on his world travels. When he first thought of inviting <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to his home, he feared that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> might take offense at the sight of these so-called images. But Flavius was agreeably surprised when Jesus entered the home that, instead of rebuking him for having these supposedly idolatrous objects scattered about the house, he manifested great interest in the entire collection and asked many appreciative questions about each object as Flavius escorted him from room to room, showing him all of his favorite statues.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_2">142:4.2</a></small></sup>  The Master saw that his host was bewildered at his friendly attitude toward <a href="/en/topic/art">art</a>; therefore, when they had finished the survey of the entire collection, Jesus said: “Because you appreciate the beauty of things created by my Father and fashioned by the artistic hands of man, why should you expect to be rebuked? Because <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> onetime sought to combat <a href="/en/topic/idolatry">idolatry</a> and the worship of false gods, why should all men frown upon the reproduction of grace and beauty? I say to you, Flavius, Moses’ children have misunderstood him, and now do they make false gods of even his prohibitions of images and the likeness of things in heaven and on earth. But even if Moses taught such restrictions to the darkened minds of those days, what has that to do with this day when the Father in heaven is revealed as the universal Spirit Ruler over all? And, Flavius, I declare that in the coming kingdom they shall no longer teach, ‘Do not worship this and do not worship that’; no longer shall they concern themselves with commands to refrain from this and take care not to do that, but rather shall all be concerned with one supreme duty. And this duty of man is expressed in two great privileges: sincere worship of the infinite Creator, the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, and loving service bestowed upon one’s fellow men. If you love your neighbor as you love yourself, you really know that you are a son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_3">142:4.3</a></small></sup>  “In an age when my Father was not well understood, Moses was justified in his attempts to withstand idolatry, but in the coming age the Father will have been revealed in the life of the Son; and this new revelation of God will make it forever unnecessary to confuse the Creator Father with idols of stone or images of gold and silver. Henceforth, intelligent men may enjoy the treasures of art without confusing such material appreciation of beauty with the worship and service of the Father in Paradise, the God of all things and all beings.”</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_4">142:4.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a> believed all that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> taught him. The next day he went to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_beyond_Jordan">Bethany beyond the Jordan</a> and was baptized by the disciples of John. And this he did because the apostles of Jesus did not yet baptize believers. When Flavius returned to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he made a great feast for Jesus and invited sixty of his friends. And many of these guests also became believers in the message of the coming kingdom.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p5_1">142:5.1</a></small></sup>  One of the great sermons which <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> preached in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> this <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week was in answer to a question asked by one of his hearers, a man from <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>. This man asked Jesus: “But, Rabbi, how shall we know of a certainty that you are sent by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and that we may truly enter into this kingdom which you and your disciples declare is near at hand?” And Jesus answered:</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p5_2">142:5.2</a></small></sup>  “As to my message and the teaching of my disciples, you should <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> them by their fruits. If we proclaim to you the truths of the spirit, the spirit will witness in your hearts that our message is genuine. Concerning the kingdom and your <a href="/en/topic/assurance">assurance</a> of acceptance by the heavenly Father, let me ask what father among you who is a worthy and kindhearted father would keep his son in anxiety or suspense regarding his status in the family or his place of security in the affections of his father’s heart? Do you earth fathers take pleasure in torturing your children with uncertainty about their place of abiding love in your human hearts? Neither does your Father in heaven leave his faith children of the spirit in doubtful uncertainty as to their position in the kingdom. If you receive God as your Father, then indeed and in <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> are you the sons of God. And if you are sons, then are you secure in the position and standing of all that concerns eternal and divine sonship. If you believe my words, you thereby believe in Him who sent me, and by thus believing in the Father, you have made your status in heavenly citizenship sure. If you do the will of the Father in heaven, you shall never fail in the attainment of the eternal life of progress in the divine kingdom<sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p5_3">142:5.3</a></small></sup>  “The <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Spirit shall bear witness with your spirits that you are truly the children of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. And if you are the sons of God, then have you been born of the spirit of God; and whosoever has been born of the spirit has in himself the power to overcome all <a href="/en/topic/doubt">doubt</a>, and this is the victory that overcomes all uncertainty, even your <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a><sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p5_4">142:5.4</a></small></sup>  “Said the Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a>, speaking of these times: ‘When the spirit is poured upon us from on high, then shall the work of righteousness become peace, quietness, and <a href="/en/topic/assurance">assurance</a> forever.’ And for all who truly believe this gospel, I will become surety for their reception into the eternal mercies and the everlasting life of my Father’s kingdom. You, then, who hear this message and believe this gospel of the kingdom are the sons of God, and you have life everlasting; and the evidence to all the world that you have been born of the spirit is that you sincerely <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> one another.”<sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p5_5">142:5.5</a></small></sup>  The throng of listeners remained many hours with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, asking him questions and listening attentively to his comforting answers. Even the apostles were emboldened by Jesus’ teaching to preach the gospel of the kingdom with more power and assurance. This experience at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was a great inspiration to the twelve. It was their first contact with such enormous crowds, and they learned many valuable lessons which proved of great assistance in their later work.</p>

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_1">142:6.1</a></small></sup>  One evening at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a> there came to see <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> one <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>, a wealthy and elderly member of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a><sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup>. He had heard much about the teachings of this Galilean, and so he went one afternoon to hear him as he taught in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> courts. He would have gone often to hear Jesus teach, but he feared to be seen by the people in attendance upon his teaching, for already were the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> so at variance with Jesus that no member of the Sanhedrin would want to be identified in any open manner with him. Accordingly, Nicodemus had arranged with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to see Jesus privately and after nightfall on this particular evening. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John were in Flavius’s <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> when the interview began, but later they all went into the house where the discourse continued.</p>

<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_2">142:6.2</a></small></sup>  In receiving Nicodemus, Jesus showed no particular deference; in talking with him, there was no compromise or undue persuasiveness. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> made no attempt to repulse his secretive caller, nor did he employ sarcasm. In all his dealings with the distinguished visitor, Jesus was calm, earnest, and dignified. Nicodemus was not an official delegate of the Sanhedrin; he came to see Jesus wholly because of his personal and sincere interest in the Master’s teachings.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_3">142:6.3</a></small></sup>  Upon being presented by <a href="/en/topic/Flavius">Flavius</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> said: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, for no mere man could so teach unless God were with him. And I am desirous of knowing more about your teachings regarding the coming kingdom<sup id="cite34"><a href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_4">142:6.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> answered Nicodemus: “Verily, verily, I say to you, Nicodemus, except a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God<sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup>.” Then replied Nicodemus: “But how can a man be born again when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born<sup id="cite36"><a href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5">142:6.5</a></small></sup>  Jesus said: “Nevertheless, I declare to you, except a man be born of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. That which is born of the <a href="/en/topic/flesh">flesh</a> is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. But you should not marvel that I said you must be born from above. When the <a href="/en/topic/wind">wind</a> blows, you hear the rustle of the leaves, but you do not see the wind—whence it comes or whither it goes—and so it is with everyone born of the spirit. With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit<sup id="cite37"><a href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_6">142:6.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> replied: “But I do not understand—how can that be?” Said <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>: “Can it be that you are a teacher in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> and yet ignorant of all this? It becomes, then, the duty of those who know about the realities of the spirit to reveal these things to those who discern only the manifestations of the material world<sup id="cite38"><a href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup>. But will you believe us if we tell you of the heavenly truths? Do you have the courage, Nicodemus, to believe in one who has descended from heaven, even the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>?”<sup id="cite39"><a href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_7">142:6.7</a></small></sup>  And Nicodemus said: “But how can I begin to lay hold upon this spirit which is to remake me in preparation for entering into the kingdom?” Jesus answered: “Already does the spirit of the Father in heaven indwell you. If you would be led by this spirit from above, very soon would you begin to see with the eyes of the spirit, and then by the wholehearted choice of spirit guidance would you be born of the spirit since your only purpose in living would be to do the will of your Father who is in heaven. And so finding yourself born of the spirit and happily in the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, you would begin to bear in your daily life the abundant fruits of the spirit.”</p>

He was deeply impressed but went away bewildered. Nicodemus was accomplished in self-development, in self-restraint, and even in high moral qualities. He was refined, egoistic, and altruistic; but he did not know how to <i>submit</i> his will to the will of the divine Father as a little child is willing to submit to the guidance and leading of a wise and loving earthly father, thereby becoming in reality a son of God, a progressive heir of the eternal kingdom.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_9">142:6.9</a></small></sup>  But Nicodemus did summon faith enough to lay hold of the kingdom.

<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. THE LESSON ON THE FAMILY </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_1">142:7.1</a></small></sup>  After the busy period of teaching and personal work of <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent the next <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> with his apostles, resting. That afternoon, Thomas asked a question which elicited a long and instructive answer. Said Thomas: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, on the day we were set apart as ambassadors of the kingdom, you told us many things, instructed us regarding our personal mode of life, but what shall we teach the multitude? How are these people to live after the kingdom more fully comes? Shall your disciples own slaves? Shall your believers court poverty and shun property? Shall mercy alone prevail so that we shall have no more law and justice?” Jesus and the twelve spent all afternoon and all that evening, after supper, discussing Thomas’s questions. For the purposes of this record we present the following summary of the Master’s instruction:</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_2">142:7.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus sought first to make plain to his apostles that he himself was on earth living a unique life in the flesh, and that they, the twelve, had been called to participate in this bestowal experience of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>; and as such coworkers, they, too, must share in many of the special restrictions and obligations of the entire bestowal experience. There was a veiled intimation that the Son of Man was the only person who had ever lived on earth who could simultaneously see into the very heart of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and into the very depths of man’s soul.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_3">142:7.3</a></small></sup>  Very plainly <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> explained that the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> was an evolutionary experience, beginning here on earth and progressing up through successive life stations to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. In the course of the evening he definitely stated that at some future stage of kingdom development he would revisit this world in spiritual power and divine glory.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_4">142:7.4</a></small></sup>  He next explained that the “kingdom idea” was not the best way to illustrate man’s relation to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>; that he employed such figures of speech because the Jewish people were expecting the kingdom, and because John had preached in terms of the coming kingdom. Jesus said: “The people of another age will better understand the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom when it is presented in terms expressive of the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> relationship—when man understands religion as the teaching of the fatherhood of God and the <a href="/en/topic/brotherhood_(attitude)">brotherhood</a> of man, sonship with God<sup id="cite41"><a href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup>.” Then the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> discoursed at some length on the earthly family as an illustration of the heavenly family, restating the two fundamental laws of living: <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> commandment of love for the father, the head of the family, and the second commandment of mutual love among the children, to love your brother as yourself. And then he explained that such a quality of brotherly affection would invariably manifest itself in unselfish and loving social <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_5">142:7.5</a></small></sup>  Following that, came the memorable discussion of the fundamental characteristics of family life and their application to the relationship existing between God and man. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> stated that a true family is founded on the following seven facts:</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_6">142:7.6</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The fact of existence.</i> The relationships of nature and the phenomena of mortal likenesses are bound up in the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a>: Children inherit certain parental traits. The children take origin in the parents; personality existence depends on the act of the parent. The relationship of father and child is inherent in all nature and pervades all living existences.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_7">142:7.7</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Security and pleasure.</i> True <a href="/en/topic/fathers">fathers</a> take great pleasure in providing for the needs of their children. Many fathers are not content with supplying the mere wants of their children but enjoy making provision for their pleasures also.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_8">142:7.8</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Education and training.</i> Wise fathers carefully plan for the <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> and adequate training of their sons and daughters. When young they are prepared for the greater responsibilities of later life.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_9">142:7.9</a></small></sup>  4. <i>Discipline and restraint.</i> Farseeing <a href="/en/topic/fathers">fathers</a> also make provision for the necessary <a href="/en/topic/discipline">discipline</a>, guidance, correction, and sometimes restraint of their young and immature offspring.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_10">142:7.10</a></small></sup>  5. <i>Companionship and loyalty.</i> The affectionate father holds intimate and loving intercourse with his children. Always is his ear open to their petitions; he is ever ready to share their hardships and assist them over their difficulties. The father is supremely interested in the progressive welfare of his progeny.</p>
<p id="p7_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_11">142:7.11</a></small></sup>  6. <i>Love and mercy.</i> A compassionate father is freely forgiving; <a href="/en/topic/fathers">fathers</a> do not hold vengeful memories against their children. Fathers are not like judges, enemies, or creditors. Real families are built upon tolerance, patience, and forgiveness.</p>
<p id="p7_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_12">142:7.12</a></small></sup>  7. <i>Provision for the future.</i> Temporal fathers like to leave an <a href="/en/topic/inheritance">inheritance</a> for their sons. The <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> continues from one generation to another. Death only ends one generation to mark the beginning of another. Death terminates an individual life but not necessarily the family.</p>
<p id="p7_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_13">142:7.13</a></small></sup>  For hours the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> discussed the application of these features of family life to the relations of man, the earth child, to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father. And this was his conclusion: “This entire relationship of a son to the Father, I know in perfection, for all that you must attain of sonship in the eternal future I have now already attained. The <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> is prepared to ascend to the <a href="/en/topic/right_hand_of_the_Father">right hand of the Father</a>, so that in me is the way now open still wider for all of you to see God and, ere you have finished the glorious progression, to become perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect<sup id="cite42"><a href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p7_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_14">142:7.14</a></small></sup>  When the apostles heard these startling words, they recalled the pronouncements which John made at the time of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ baptism, and they also vividly recalled this experience in connection with their preaching and teaching subsequent to the Master’s death and resurrection.</p>
<p id="p7_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_15">142:7.15</a></small></sup>  Jesus is a divine Son, one in the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>’s full confidence. He had been with the Father and comprehended him fully. He had now lived his earth life to the full satisfaction of the Father, and this incarnation in the flesh had enabled him fully to comprehend man. Jesus was the <a href="/en/topic/perfection">perfection</a> of man; he had attained just such perfection as all true believers are destined to attain in him and through him. Jesus revealed a <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of perfection to man and presented in himself the perfected son of the realms to God.</p>
<p id="p7_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_16">142:7.16</a></small></sup>  Although <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> discoursed for several hours, Thomas was not yet satisfied, for he said: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we do not find that the Father in heaven always deals kindly and mercifully with us. Many times we grievously suffer on earth, and not always are our prayers answered. Where do we fail to grasp the meaning of your teaching?”</p>
<p id="p7_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_17">142:7.17</a></small></sup>  Jesus replied: “Thomas, Thomas, how long before you will acquire the ability to listen with the ear of the spirit? How long will it be before you discern that this kingdom is a spiritual kingdom, and that my Father is also a spiritual being? Do you not understand that I am teaching you as spiritual children in the spirit <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> of heaven, of which the fatherhead is an infinite and eternal spirit? Will you not allow me to use the earth family as an illustration of divine relationships without so literally applying my teaching to material affairs? In your minds cannot you separate the spiritual realities of the kingdom from the material, social, economic, and political problems of the age? When I speak the <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> of the spirit, why do you insist on translating my meaning into the language of the flesh just because I presume to employ commonplace and literal relationships for purposes of illustration? My children, I implore that you cease to apply the teaching of the kingdom of the spirit to the sordid affairs of slavery, poverty, houses, and lands, and to the material problems of human equity and <a href="/en/topic/justice">justice</a>. These temporal matters are the concern of the men of this world, and while in a way they affect all men, you have been called to represent me in the world, even as I represent my Father. You are spiritual ambassadors of a spiritual kingdom, special representatives of the spirit Father. By this time it should be possible for me to instruct you as full-grown men of the spirit kingdom. Must I ever address you only as children? Will you never grow up in spirit perception? Nevertheless, I love you and will bear with you, even to the very end of our association in the flesh. And even then shall my spirit go before you into all the world.”</p>
<h2 id="p8" class="toc-header"><a href="#p8" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 8. IN SOUTHERN JUDEA </h2>
<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_1">142:8.1</a></small></sup>  By the end of April the opposition to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> among the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> had become so pronounced that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his apostles decided to leave <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for a while, going south to work in <a href="/en/topic/Bethlehem_(Judea)">Bethlehem</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a><sup id="cite43"><a href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup>. The entire month of May was spent in doing personal work in these cities and among the people of the surrounding villages. No public preaching was done on this trip, only house-to-house visitation. A part of this time, while the apostles taught the gospel and ministered to the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a>, Jesus and <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> spent at <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a>, visiting the Nazarite colony. <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> had gone forth from this place, and Abner had been head of this group. Many of the Nazarite brotherhood became believers in Jesus, but the majority of these ascetic and eccentric men refused to accept him as a teacher sent from heaven because he did not teach <a href="/en/topic/fasting">fasting</a> and other forms of <a href="/en/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a>.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_2">142:8.2</a></small></sup>  The people living in this region did not know that Jesus had been born in Bethlehem. They always supposed the Master had been born at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, as did the vast majority of his disciples, but the twelve knew the facts.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_3">142:8.3</a></small></sup>  This sojourn in the south of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> was a restful and fruitful season of labor; many souls were added to the kingdom. By <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> days of June the agitation against <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had so quieted down in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and the apostles returned to instruct and comfort believers.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_4">142:8.4</a></small></sup>  Although Jesus and the apostles spent the entire month of June in or near Jerusalem, they did no public teaching during this period. They lived for the most part in tents, which they pitched in a shaded park, or <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, known in that day as <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>. This park was situated on the western slope of the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_of_Olives">Mount of Olives</a> not far from the brook <a href="/en/topic/Kidron">Kidron</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> weekends they usually spent with <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and his sisters at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Jesus entered within the walls of Jerusalem only a few times, but a large number of interested inquirers came out to Gethsemane to visit with him. One <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> evening <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> and one <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a> ventured out to see Jesus but turned back through fear even after they were standing before the entrance to the Master’s tent. And, of course, they did not perceive that Jesus knew all about their doings.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_5">142:8.5</a></small></sup>  When the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> learned that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had returned to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, they prepared to arrest him; but when they observed that he did no public preaching, they concluded that he had become frightened by their previous agitation and decided to allow him to carry on his teaching in this private manner without further molestation. And thus affairs moved along quietly until <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> days of June, when one <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, a member of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, publicly espoused the teachings of Jesus, after so declaring himself before the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a>. Immediately a new agitation for Jesus’ apprehension sprang up and grew so strong that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> decided to retire into the cities of <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Decapolis">Decapolis</a><sup id="cite44"><a href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup>.</p>
