## What is?

[Urantiapedia](https://urantiapedia.org) is a web for publishing, sharing and collaborating in any content related to [The Urantia Book](https://www.urantia.org/).


## Our mission

The key mission we have set for *Urantiapedia* is:
1. Help in dissemination of *The Urantia Book* revelations throughout the world.
2. Allow for a better understanding of the teachings of *The Urantia Book*.
3. Offer the usefulness of linking most of the current knowledge available about the Urantia revelation.


## How it works?

It is based in [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/), a powerful and extensible open source Wiki software that is build on top of modern technologies like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). *Wiki.js* can be used freely by any org to create any type of Wiki.

A Wiki is a webpage maintained and edited collaboratively by a user community. Any registered user, after some validations, can add, modify or delete content, and all changes are saved in a permament historical, so nothing is lost in an accidental removal. Information is stored in a database so it can do the classic actions as massive additions/removals, backups or searches.

To facilitate addition of content, a program called *Urantiapedia Tools* is under development. This program automates format conversion tasks and helps with content review tasks.

Both *Urantiapedia Tools* and *Wiki.js* will receive new functionality as *Urantiapedia* extends its content types. The developments and the content files are available from the web [Urantiapedia at GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia). This website is public and anyone can make contributions following the GitHub methodology or just sending content through email.

## How is it organized?

As in any Wiki the content are pages, each one with a unique URL and a title. These are main contents expected:

* Books, like *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible* and other texts related with the Urantia revelations. Each chapter of books is one page in *Urantiapedia*.
* Topics about any matter mentioned in *The Urantia Book*. Each topic is stored in a page.
* Articles written by readers, each one a page.
* Images, either drawings or photographs to illustrate concepts of *The Urantia Book*, each in its own page.
* Diagrams or presentations, also in pages.
* Interactive maps, either in 2D or 3D, showing locations or voyages described in the Urantia revelations. Each map is one page. Maps can be static or contain animations to create flyovers.
* 3D models, each in a page, that can be static or interactive as in maps.

For more information on the content check here: [Content](/en/help/content)


## Milestones of the project

For each language to be included in the *Urantipedia*, all tasks will be carried out in specific milestones:
1. Milestone I - The Urantia Book, the Bible and Topic Index
2. Milestone II - Books, articles, study aids, diagrams and indexes
3. Milestone III - Translator
4. Milestone IV - Interactive maps
5. Milestone V - Slides
6. Milestone VI - 3D interactive models

To find out about the Milestone of the project, check [Project Milestones](/en/help/phases).


## Current status

Currently *Urantiapedia* stands as follows:
* in all supported languages (25): in phase I.
* in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese: between phase I and phase II.
