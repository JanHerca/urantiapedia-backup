## Introduction

### Wellcome!

Urantiapedia is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make Urantiapedia more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how Urantiapedia collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the website. It is essential to understand that, by using Urantiapedia website you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you shouldn't have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in Urantiapedia movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to Urantiapedia.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make Urantiapedia more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make Urantiapedia better for you.

After all, it's people like you, the champions of _Urantia Book_ students, who make it possible for Urantiapedia to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.

### Definitions

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:

### Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It

The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username. We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how Urantiapedia site is used, as further explained below in the "How We Use Information We Receive From You" section of this Privacy Policy.

Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.

You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.

#### Information We Receive Automatically

Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit Urantiapedia site. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from Urantiapedia site. This information includes the type of device you are using, the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to Urantiapedia site, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to Urantiapedia site.

#### Information We Collect

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from Urantiapedia site. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your IP address), and information about your use of Urantiapedia site (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

## Sharing

### When May We Share Your Information?

#### With Your Permission

We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree.

#### For Legal Reasons

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

#### To Protect You, Ourselves & Others

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it's reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.

## Protection

### How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can't guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to urantiapedia@gmail.com, so we can investigate the source of the email.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of Urantiapedia site, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate.

Please remember that when you make a contribution to Urantiapedia site, the page history will show when your contribution was made and your username. The transparency of the project contributions and revision history is critical to its efficacy and trustworthiness.

## Your rights

If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may Contact Us. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Account page.
