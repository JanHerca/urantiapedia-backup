Here we describe how to create a catalog of books that are supposed to be sources of *The Urantia Book* or have some relationship or parallel to *The Urantia Book*.

## Context

*The Urantia Book* itself offers two clear indications about a human material that has been used for its elaboration ([UB 0:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_12) and [UB 121:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_13)). Added to all this, it should be noted that *The Urantia Book* quotes many times textually or implicitly books from the *Bible*, including extra-canonical books, and others.

Several prominent readers have long compiled these parallels. Reader Duane L. Faw has published an extensive volume entitled [Paramony](https://www.amazon.com/Paramony-Duane-L-Faw/dp/0965197255/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2FCT0LM14FRVT) in which he details some 60,000 parallels between *The Urantia Book* and *The Bible*. Another prominent reader, Matthew Block, has spent years developing [a project of locating parallels](https://urantiabooksources.com/) with non-biblical books written up to the time of conception of *The Urantia Book*, having detected more than a hundred books as potential sources of the authors.

## Process

This task is the creation of a list of all the non-biblical books that have been detected with parallels with *The Urantia Book*. An invaluable source for this listing is to go to Matthew Block's website.

The provisional list of books can be found here: [Books](/en/book).

To edit that list, you can do it in two ways:
- Log in here at *Urantiapedia*. Go to the list of books: [Books](/en/book). Put the page in edition in the menu *Page actions > Edit* in the upper right button panel. A simple Markdown editor will open where you can edit the book listing. (IMPORTANT: to be able to do this you need an Administrator to enable editing permissions on that page.)
- In the GitHub project, modify this file: `/output/wikijs/en/book.md`. To modify it, you can simply download that file or the entire project from GitHub. See the [Assistant Editors help](/en/help/github_assistant) to learn how to download things from GitHub.

In either of the two previous cases, the file to be edited is a very simple Markdown file where for each book you must include the title, the author, and the year of the first edition.

If you have modified the listing from the file on GitHub, you have two options for submitting your changes: 1) if you are a “Chief Editor” use GitHub as detailed in [Chief Editors help](/en/help/github); if you are an “Assistant Editor”, you can simply send that modified Markdown file to any Administrator's email or to urantiapedia@gmail.com.
