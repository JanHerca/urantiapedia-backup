## Overview

These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at Urantiapedia, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We want you to know that we host a spiritual and religious content, all of which is contributed and made possible by readers of _The Urantia Book_ like yourself. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and other _Urantia Book_ readers who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.

The community – the group of _Urantia Book_ readers who are constantly building this website – are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern Urantiapedia. The community undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the content.

You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern Urantiapedia. Urantiapedia has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content. You are welcome to join the team and work with it to improve the project. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Urantiapedia content under the laws of Spain and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important that you use caution when posting content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other _Urantia Book_ readers like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for spiritual enlightenment purposes only, so this site do not contain medical, legal or financial information, that should require the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

## 1. Our Services

Urantiapedia is dedicated to the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ revelations, the biggest and most recent revelation of truth made in the Earth. For this we are encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and hosting the full content of these wiki-content for the public free of charge. Our role is to host the largest collaboratively edited _Urantia Book_ reference, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows _Urantia Book_ readers to build Urantiapedia by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, Urantiapedia, and the other users:
- a. **We do not take an editorial role**: Because Urantiapedia is collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by _Urantia Book_ readers like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the content that the _Urantia Book_ readers have contributed and edited.
- b. **You are responsible for your own actions**: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Urantiapedia, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of Spain. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. Urantiapedia generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.

## 2. Privacy Policy

By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.

## 3. Content We Host

You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of spiritual and religious content that is produced or gathered by _Urantia Book_ readers, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.

Our content is for spiritual enlightenment purposes only: We do not host at all information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues. No content should be taken as professional advice.

Pursuant to the copyright laws, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system who are repeat infringers.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a copyright takedown demand is invalid or improper.

## 10. Management of Websites

The Urantiapedia community of contributors has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to it. In an unusual case we can address an especially problematic contributor user because of significant disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:
- Investigate contributors use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;
- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;

In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the site. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.

## 13. Disputes and Jurisdiction

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by Urantiapedia. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in Spain. You also agree that the laws of Spain will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in Spain, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

## 14. Disclaimers

At Urantiapedia, we do our best to provide spiritual enlighting content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some countries or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.

## 15. Limitation on Liability

Urantiapedia will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one hundred euros (EUR 100.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

## 16. Modifications to these Terms of Use

Just as Urantiapedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the project, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the project website. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of Urantiapedia and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.

## 17. Other Terms

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, Urantiapedia. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on the project website.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community of Urantiapedia, or the Urantiapedia board.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (Urantiapedia board) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the project when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.
