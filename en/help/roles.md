To collaborate with the project best way is sign up in [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/) webpage, that is a site created to join and organize *Urantia Book* readers worldwide that want to participate in smart projects, with a good purpose and altruism. Once registered the project team will contact you.

The Urantiapedia project in Blue Fields has this link: [Urantiapedia in Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/projects/292396532506821125).

The profiles we are looking for to collaborate are these:

## “Administrator” profile

*Administrators* are in charge of maintenance of the web server, the page, bulk load of data, and they are the only ones with permission to edit *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible* and future specific contents. Check more in [Admin help](/en/help/admin).

* They have an account in this with admin permissions, and another in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* They add content to both Urantiapedia projects in GitHub: [Urantiapedia](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) and [Urantiapedia-backup](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup). They can do bulk load of changes using the second project.
* The task will be to manage the server and the website.
* Good knowledge of Linux, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) will be needed.
* It will be important to have the aptitude to work in a team in open source environments.
* Good level of English as all documentation and code comments are in English.

## “Chief Editor” Profile

*Chief Editors* can also contribute content via GitHub, just like Admins, even in bulk loads. They do not manage the website but have all the editing capabilities of an Administrator, with the exception of *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible* and some other sensitive content. Check [Chief Editors help](/en/help/github).

## “Assistant Editor” profile

*Assistant Editors* can edit certain sections of the website for which they are given permissions. They can also email revisions and translations for *Admins* or *Chief Editors* to bulk upload, making the job easier for this type of contributors.
