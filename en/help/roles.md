To collaborate with the project best way is sign up in *Blue Fields* (https://blue-fields.netlify.app/) webpage, that is a site created to join and organize *Urantia Book* readers worldwide that want to participate in smart projects, with a good purpose and altruism. Once registered the project team will contact you.

The Urantiapedia project in Blue Fields has this link: [Urantiapedia in Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/projects/292396532506821125).

The profiles we are looking for to collaborate are these:

## “Administrator” profile

*Administrators* are in charge of maintenance of the web server, the page, bulk load of data, and they are the only ones with permission to edit *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible* and future specific contents. Check more in [Admin help](/en/help/admin).

* The task will be to manage the server and the website.
* Good knowledge of Linux, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) will be needed.
* It will be important to have the aptitude to work in a team in open source environments.
* Good level of English as all documentation and code comments are in English.

## “Chief Editor” Profile

*Chief Editors* require a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and they use it to contribute adding updates and translations to [Urantiapedia project at GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) that can be bulk uploaded. Check [Chief Editors help](/en/help/github).

* The first task will be to update the content of the *Topic Index*, which is the largest task of phase I. Then they proceed with the content of the next milestones.
* A good knowledge of *The Urantia Book* will be needed in at least one language, but better if it is English and a second language on which the book is translated.
* It will be important to have the ability to write well and correctly.
* It will help to have personal availability for this, patience and perseverance.
* It is important to have a good working knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## “Assistant Editor” profile

*Assistant Editors* just need an account on this site, and after passing a validation process, will have permission to edit certain sections such as the *Topic Index*, articles, and material not reserved by administrators. Assistant editors also can send reviews and translations for bulk-uploading to Chief Editors without using GitHub, which can make work easier for this type of collaborators. Check [Assistant Editors help](/en/help/github_assistant).

* A good knowledge of *The Urantia Book* will be needed in at least one language, but better if it is English and a second language on which the book is translated.
* It will be important to have the ability to write well and correctly.
* No special computer knowledge will be necessary as the main job is done through the web or by email.

## “Author” profile

Authors are *Assistant Editors* who, apart from being able to edit what any *Assistant Editor* can, are also only editors with permission to edit certain content of which they are authors.

## “Developer” profile

*Developers* have a GitHub account where they develop the functionality of *Urantiapedia Tools* and *Wiki.js*. Check [Developers help](/en/help/devs).

* The task will be to develop the functionalities of *Urantiapedia Tools* and *Wiki.js* necessary for the project.
* Good knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) will be required.
* It will be important to have the aptitude to work in a team and open source environments.
* Good level of English as the documentation and code comments are in English.

## “Reviewer” profile

* The task will be to ensure the correctness of users and content. Reviewers will have permissions to block users or content that do not comply with policies and fair use of the web.
* A good knowledge of *The Urantia Book* will be needed in at least one language, but better if it is English and a second language on which the book is translated.
* No special computer knowledge will be necessary as the main job is done through the web.
