If you want to collaborate on this project, the best way to contact us is by email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. Send a message stating your interest in the project and the Administrators will give you access.

Another way that will be available soon is through registration on the website [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/), which is a website that has been created to unite and organize readers of *The Urantia Book* who wish to participate in intelligent, purposeful, and altruistic projects around the world. Once registered, the project team will contact you. The Urantiapedia project on Blue Fields can be accessed here: [Urantiapedia on Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/projects/292396532506821125). However, this website is not 100% operational, so contact via email is recommended.

The profiles we are looking for to collaborate are these:

## “Administrator” profile

*Administrators* are responsible for maintaining the web server, configuring the website, and bulk uploading data. They are the only ones allowed to edit everything, including *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible*, and other specific content. Check more in [Admin help](/en/help/admin).

* They have an account in this with admin permissions, and another in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* They can add content both through this website (without restrictions) as well as through the two Urantiapedia projects on GitHub: [Urantiapedia](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) and [Urantiapedia-backup](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup). They can do bulk load of changes using the second project.
* The task will be to manage the server and the website.
* Good knowledge of Linux, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) will be needed.
* It will be important to have the aptitude to work in a team in open source environments.
* Good level of English as all documentation and code comments are in English.

## “Editor-in-Chief” Profile

*Editors-in-Chief* can also contribute content through this site and GitHub, just like Administrators. However, they do not manage the site, they do not have all the editing capabilities of an Administrator, such as *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible*, and some other sensitive content, and through GitHub they can only make pull requests, never direct changes. Check [Editors-in-Chief help](/en/help/github).

However, only pull requests can be made through these projects. Changes to unauthorized content on GitHub will be rejected upon submission.
* A good knowledge of *The Urantia Book* is needed in at least one language, but better if it is English and a second language on which the book is translated.

## “Assistant Editor” profile

*Assistant Editors* only use GitHub to submit change requests. They do not have an account on this site. To make their work easier, they can also send their changes by email to urantiapedia@gmail.com, and the *Administrators* will take care of uploading these changes. See: [Manual for Assistant Editors](/en/help/github_assistant).

* The task will be to develop the functionalities of *Urantiapedia Tools* and *Wiki.js* necessary for the project. Modifications to Wiki.js are being centralized here: [Wiki.js](https://github.com/JanHerca/wiki), which is a *fork* of the original project.

* A good knowledge of the *Urantia Book* in at least one language is required, but it is better if it is English and a second language into which the book is translated.
* Special computer skills are not necessary since the main work is done via email.
