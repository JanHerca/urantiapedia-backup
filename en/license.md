### Disclaimers

**URANTIAPEDIA MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY**

Urantiapedia is an online open-content collaborative encyclopedia; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge. The structure of the project allows anyone with an Internet connection to alter its content. Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate, or reliable information.

That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information in Urantiapedia; much of the time you will.

#### No formal peer review

Our active community of editors uses tools to monitor new and changing content. However, Urantiapedia is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever.
