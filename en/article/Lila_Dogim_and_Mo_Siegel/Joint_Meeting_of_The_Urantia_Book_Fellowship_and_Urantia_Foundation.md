On Monday, October 22, 2012, representatives of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship and Urantia Foundation held a joint meeting designed to foster mutual appreciation and understanding and to explore possibilities for increased inter-organizational cooperative activities in the areas of Urantia Book sales and distribution. The gathering of fourteen individuals included the presidents, vice-presidents and executive directors of both organizations.

An atmosphere of goodwill pervaded the six-hour meeting during which the participants shared viewpoints and concerns on various matters connected with advancing the study and dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ in the world. Those participating in the meeting held themselves to the high standards of understanding, love, and forgiveness.

Urantia Foundation and _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship currently engage in a number of cooperative activities, including sponsoring the development of the Standard Reference Text and distributing translations of _The Urantia Book_ through the Pipeline of Light program. As a result of this meeting, both organizations are actively exploring opportunities for joint service. Participants left the meeting encouraged that both human and organizational problems can be solved in the spirit of cooperation.
