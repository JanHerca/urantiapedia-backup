I've been reading _The Urantia Book_ since 1972 and can empathize with the difficulty of integrating traditional Christian beliefs with the new concepts of _The Urantia Book_. Although new religious organizations may be inspired by the Fifth Epochal Revelation, we need not reject the traditional religions that we have grown up with. The expanded and enhanced concepts presented in _The Urantia Book_ do introduce some conflicts and differences with traditional views, but we should remember that spiritual growth always involves an intellectual adjustment to new and more mature concepts. Have we not all had the experience of learning one thing as a child and then having to deal with a more grown-up idea when we were older? We see such changes in all contemporary religious groups. For instance, I grew up as a Catholic with the belief that it was a sin to eatmeat on Friday. When the church changed this rule, it did not destroy my faith in a loving heavenly Father. There are, of course, some irreconcilable conflicts that must be transcended in spiritual growth, but that is what growing up is all about. We need not throw the baby out with the bath water.

Virtually all of the world religions include the concept of an infinite Deity. Is it not myopic or arrogant to limit our concept of God? If we truly believe in the infinity of God, does it not follow that we will always be challenged with an expanding concept of the First Source and Center of all things and beings? It is my conviction that those who accept the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ as the best conceptualization of their personal religion will not reject their religious heritage. In some cases, their traditional religion may reject them, but I see no reason to deny the good work and constructive aspects of the traditional evolutionary religions.

## The Book of Positive Qualities

Jim Downs
Warner Books, 1996, 612 pp.

Jim Downs has compiled an encyclopedic list of these values. He says, “I have always been interested in ultimates and cosmic meanings: Why do we exist? What are the most important things to do and be in life? What are true values? This book is my answer to these questions. I decided to gather a complete list of positive qualities. After years of searching (and I'm still looking), I have a list of more than 1800 . I boiled them down to the 988 featured here... I intend this book to not only be information oriented but also inspiration-oriented, meaning-oriented, and valueoriented.” (p. xi)

The book attempts to stimulate guidance, balance, and inspiration for spiritual growth. It is an inspiring compendium of admirable traits to nurture self-improvement. Jim has also created a _Positive Qualities Chart and a Love, Truth, Beauty, Goodness_ button. All of these may be obtained through the Good Cheer Press, Box 18764, Boulder, CO 80308.
