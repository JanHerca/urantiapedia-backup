There are as many different ways for study groups to conduct their meetings as there are groups. A survey in some sections of the East resulted in these brief profiles:

**Group 1** begins with a moment of quiet, holding hands. The weekly meetings are on Tuesday evenings, always at the same house; about 7 attend, among them several high school students. They are reading from the beginning, one or two papers a week; each person reads a section. Members may break in to discuss, and especially to explore social and political implications.

**Group 2** meets each week on Thursday evenings, (recessed in summer), and operates under a strict schedule. Socializing fills the first half hour 7:30 to 8:00. Reading starts wherever the last meeting left off; they are going through the book from beginning to end. Leadership rotates, and there may be questions and discussion. Reading stops at 9:30 sharp, allowing only time to finish the section. From 9:30 to 10:30, a topical leader presents any subject related to the book which he chooses, complete with art, music and related other references. At 10:30, there is a general discussion.

**Group 3** is composed of 11 members who have been URANTIA Book readers for some time. This group's purpose is serious, in-depth study of the more difficult concepts. The meetings rotate among three central locations; several members come long distances. A coordinator serves the group in matters of communication regarding time, place and assignments. The schedule calls for 6 P.M. Saturday evening, (after dinner), until any hour, once every two months. Leadership rotates, and the leader is responsible for an assignment for each member one month in advance. The topic is decided by consensus, and no time limit is set on any topic; it is explored until “finished”, perhaps requiring several meetings. The book is read during meetings only where it refers specifically to the assigned topic.

**Group 4** is quite small, meets every Tuesday evening with dessert, coffee and conversation first, and breaking about 10:30 P.M. Each member reads aloud as long as he wishes; they are now in the Local Universe section. Anyone may interrupt to question or elaborate a point; they may or may not finish a paper.

**Group 5** is composed of 8-10 people who meet every Monday night. One person chooses a paper for the following meeting; reading is shared around the circle, any length up to a full section. They have recently completed the Foreword. This group meets also each Sunday night, not to read from the book, but to socialize and share personal concerns. Sometimes the whole evening is one person's life story. Their purpose is to better understand what it means to love one another and to do the Father's will.

**Group 6** has tried various schedules, once or twice a month, and once a week on Sunday afternoons, 1 P.M. to 2 P.M. is reserved for fellowship; at two, a brief prayer, silent or spoken. A particular passage is selected, each person reading about a page, with breaks for discussion. The whole afternoon may be spent around one point; effort is made to apply the concepts to daily life.

**Group 7** has met every Thursday for 3 years, ranging in number from 2 to 9 people. There is always a warm-up period of personal ministry; someone has a problem or there is discussion of “What's on your mind?” The choice of the paper to read is based on this rap session; members read around in turn, about 3 paragraphs. Meetings usually run from 9 P.M. until midnight. The group is especially pleased with the very wide range in ages among its members.

**Group 8** operates without a designated leader, and meets once a month on a weekend. There are usually 7-10 present. Selection of a paper is made the evening of the meeting, after a period of silent meditation and prayer. Members read around the circle, pausing for discussion.

**Group 9** is composed of four families, and meets Friday evenings, twice a month. They are reading from the beginning, with occasional digression to a requested paper. Each member reads a section; discussion is frequent, and the paper is not always completed.
