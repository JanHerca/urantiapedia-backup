_By Larry Bowman, Arizona, USA_

_Editor's Note: We have learned of the death of Nola Smith, a long-time reader of _The Urantia Book_ who was a member of the First Society and later joined the Grand Canyon Society for Readers of _The Urantia Book_. Nola died on February 26, 2009, at the age of 94 ._

Nola Smith was born in Oklahoma on February 3, 1915. After moving to Chicago in the 1940s, she became acquainted with r. Sadler. He introduced her to _The Urantia Book_ and invited her to join the Forum. Later she became a member of the Seventy, a group that met at 533 Diversey Parkway on Wednesday evenings. Nola also worked with Bill Sadler, Jr. Toward the end of her years in Chicago, she and Leone Sadler worked together at 533.

Nola moved to Arizona to take care of her elderly mother. She continued to study _The Urantia Book_, first in Scottsdale at the home of Mary Crink and later at the study group sponsored by Dick and Peggy Johnson. After Nola's mother died, she began attending social functions sponsored by the Grand Canyon Society. On the 40th anniversary of the publication of _The Urantia Book_, Nola made a presentation on the history of the Urantia movement.

Nola developed Alzheimer's and spent her final years in a nursing home in Lexington, Kentucky. Even with her burdens, I always admired her attempts to look on the bright side of life.
