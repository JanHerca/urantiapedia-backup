The Secretary General is the Secretary of the Executive Committee, which meets much more frequently than General Council as a whole. I write the minutes of the EC meetings and post them on the Fellowship website when approved, to be viewed only by other Councilors. I am also ex-officio a member of every standing Fellowship committee, although in some respects the Service Team Leaders have taken over that responsibility in relation to their particular Service Teams. Still, some committee chairs have included me in notification of their committee meetings.

As you might be able to tell from the accompanying photo, many people also think I am a doppelgänger for Bernie Sanders.
