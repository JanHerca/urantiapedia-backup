I sometimes feel very different among readers, the majority of whom are male. I often go off the beaten track in my thoughts, and I really like following my curiosity.

Triggering occurs by paying attention to my own feelings, emotions, or ideas that arise when I read a quote or story in ***The Urantia Book***.

And that's how sometimes I attach a life experience to his stories.

It goes without saying that many people are looking for light in these dark times of our civilization, as well as a deeper meaning in their lives.

In my own experience, the connection with my Adjuster is the only Divine Light that has liberated me, guiding me and directing me toward the only path to eternal happiness.

I am currently studying part 3 of the book and my attention and curiosity have pointed me to a rarely discussed subject, the story of Abel and Cain.

As I reflected on the consequences of their actions, I remembered a personal experience.

I come to tell you two stories about two people who, by benefiting from the goodness and mercy of our Father, saw the course of their lives transformed.

The first dates back more than 37,000 years.

All Christians know that Cain killed his brother Abel. The two brothers never loved each other and even hated each other for many reasons.

The main one was Abel's continual harassment of Cain because they did not have the same father, Adam.

So, when they reached eighteen and twenty years old respectively, Cain, exasperated by Abel's sarcasm, attacked and killed him.

It is interesting to note that, despite Abel's ideal hereditary heritage, his natural environment was not favorable to the development of his character.

If he had lived in the Garden of Eden, he would certainly have felt less hatred and more compassion and love in his heart.

What fascinated me most was the impact and consequences that this murder had on the rest of Cain's life, and the demonstration of our Father's Love.

His repentance led him to his mother Eve, bearer of the torch of spirituality, who taught him to sincerely seek divine support.

This is how God, in His Merciful Love, gave birth to a part of Himself in Cain.

This new Thought Adjuster guided him to a better way of life, where, repentant and transformed, he married, succeeded in maintaining peace throughout his life between two opposing and divided peoples, and had a son, Enoch, who in turn became a great leader of peace and love.

God never stops loving his children, he despises sins, but never the sinner.

Now here is my second story which is personal.

Several years ago, I met a very spiritual reader who, with great trust, did me the honor of revealing this incredible testimony to me.

I won't reveal his name, but here is his story.

In his previous life, he was one of the FBI's 10 most wanted men and spent more than half of his life in prison.

In a moment of remorse, he discovered in the prison library the wonderful _Urantia Book_.

This fifth revelation changed the course of his life; as it does for everyone who reads it, doesn't it?

His Divine Thought Adjuster could finally begin working with him.

He told me that the hardest part had been forgiving himself, but knowing that he was a son of God and that his Divine Father had already forgiven him had helped him enormously to grant himself forgiveness.

When I met him, he was no longer the monster he once called himself.

He is now a very good man, walking hand in hand with our Divine Father, serving all those in need.

These two stories are examples that demonstrate how our Father's Love was expressed in all its Splendor and Perfection and prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that with God, nothing, absolutely nothing is impossible.

I hope that these stories will comfort you, draw you more and more towards the Divine Part that lives in you and above all bring you the only true peace, lasting and eternal.

Peace on Earth and in your Hearts.
