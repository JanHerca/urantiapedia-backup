I felt the need to translate from English and share with you this beautiful reflection from Trudi Cooper, a fellow beginner student at Urantia University with whom I participate in the TEP (Teacher Education Program) training.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> vs <span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span><br>
By Trudi Cooper
</p>

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is supplication.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is praise.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is for the one who prays.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is for the Creator.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> goes no further than necessary to get an answer.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> goes directly to God the Father.
<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> passes through the circuit of the Spirit of the Son.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> passes through the circuit of the Father's personality.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> asks for help in this life and growth here and in the future. <span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> asks nothing of the Father, but opens the channel of pure, unconditional love.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> uses words.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> uses silence.

The <span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is finished

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is infinite.

The <span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> awaits an answer.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is THE answer.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is defined by the imperfection of the believer.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is defined by the perfection of God.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is the expectation of assistance. <span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> assumes ultimate perfection.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> invites God into our lives. <span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> requires becoming one with God.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is an expectation.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is an accomplishment.
