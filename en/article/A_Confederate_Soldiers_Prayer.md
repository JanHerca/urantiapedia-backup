<p style="text-align:center;">
I asked God for strength, that I might achieve; <br>
<br>
I was made weak, that I might learn humbly to obey <br>
<br>
I asked for health, that I might do greater things; <br>
<br>
I was given infirmity, that I might do better things. <br>
<br>
I asked for riches, that I might be happy; <br>
<br>
I was given poverty, that I might be wise. <br>
<br>
I asked for power, that I might have the praise of men; <br>
<br>
I was given weakness, that I might feel the need of God. <br>
<br>
I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life; <br>
<br>
I was given life, that I might enjoy all things. <br>
<br>
I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. <br>
<br>
Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. <br>
<br>
I am among all men most richly blessed. <br>
