We can develop not just a business plan but also an eternal plan. With a purpose and destiny beyond finite imaginings.

> There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. <a id="s37_323"></a>[UB 32:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_1) 

> There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving! <a id="s39_274"></a>[UB 32:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7) 

> The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust ... <a id="s41_253"></a>[UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8) 

Our earthly assignments go well beyond the corporate model. Our situation analysis is not limited to the planet. We need to expand our boundaries. We are capable of leading a spirit dominated life even now.

> Even though you must live your material life through, even though you cannot escape the body and its necessities, nonetheless, in purpose and ideals you are empowered increasingly to subject the animal nature to the mastery of the Spirit. There truly exists within you a conspiracy of spiritual forces, a confederation of divine powers, whose exclusive purpose is to effect your final deliverance from material bondage and finite handicaps. <a id="s45_443"></a>[UB 34:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_9) 

> The Spirit never _drives_, only leads. If you are a willing learner, if you want to attain spirit levels and reach divine heights, if you sincerely desire to reach the eternal goal, then the divine Spirit will gently and lovingly lead you along the pathway of sonship and spiritual progress. <a id="s47_294"></a>[UB 34:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_11) 

> The consciousness of the spirit domination of a human life is presently attended by an increasing exhibition of the characteristics of the Spirit in the life reactions of such a spirit-led mortal, “for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.” Such spirit-guided and divinely illuminated mortals, while they yet tread the lowly paths of toil and in human faithfulness perform the duties of their earthly assignments, have already begun to discern the lights of eternal life as they glimmer on the faraway shores of another world ... <a id="s49_612"></a>[UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13) 

As mortals, we have episodes of conflict and desire, and we make mistakes. But our supreme stature, our entitlements, and the rewards of an ultimate destiny remain, and are ours for the striving.

> Faith sons work on intellectual levels and live on spiritual planes far above the conflicts produced by unrestrained or unnatural physical desires. The normal urges of animal beings and the natural appetites and impulses of the physical nature are not in conflict with even the highest spiritual attainment except in the minds of ignorant, mistaught, or unfortunately overconscientious persons. <a id="s53_397"></a>[UB 34:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_7) 

> Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, “This is the way.” <a id="s55_449"></a>[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)

On high, an ideal job selection process together with appropriate training for work at hand, give way to challenges for the mind and spirit. And tasks are always for the purpose of promotion in the ascension career.

> Fundamentally, the Nebadon educational system provides for your assignment to a task and then affords you opportunity to receive instruction as to the ideal and divine method of best performing that task. You are given a definite task to perform, and at the same time you are provided with teachers who are qualified to instruct you in the best method of executing your assignment. The divine plan of education provides for the intimate association of work and instruction. We teach you how best to execute the things we command you to do. <a id="s64_542"></a>[UB 37:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_4) 

> The purpose of all this training and experience is to prepare you for admission to the higher and more spiritual training spheres of the superuniverse. Progress within a given realm is individual, but transition from one phase to another is usually by classes. <a id="s66_263"></a>[UB 37:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_5) 

> The progression of eternity does not consist solely in spiritual development. Intellectual acquisition is also a part of universal education. The experience of the mind is broadened equally with the expansion of the spiritual horizon. Mind and spirit are afforded like opportunities for training and advancement. But in all this superb training of mind and spirit you are forever free from the handicaps of mortal flesh. No longer must you constantly referee the conflicting contentions of your divergent spiritual and material natures. At last you are qualified to enjoy the unified urge of a glorified mind long since divested of primitive animalistic trends towards things material. <a id="s68_688"></a>[UB 37:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_6) 

The pursuit of truth does not necessarily confer material rewards.

> It is not so much what you learn in this first life; it is the experience of living this life that is important. Even the _work_ of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important as the _way_ in which you do this work. There is no material reward for righteous living, but there is profound — satisfaction consciousness of achievement — and this transcends any conceivable material reward. <a id="s72_408"></a>[UB 39:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13) 

Laughter is such a wonderful part of life and sometimes inexplicable in origin, we could say it is all a bit funny really.

> Even mortal humor becomes most hearty when it depicts episodes affecting those just a little beneath one's present developmental state, or when it portrays one's supposed superiors falling victim to the experiences which are commonly associated with supposed inferiors. <a id="s76_272"></a>[UB 48:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_13) 

> When we are tempted to magnify our selfimportance, if we stop to contemplate the infinity of the greatness and grandeur of our Makers, our own self-glorification becomes sublimely ridiculous, even verging on the humorous. One of the functions of humor is to help all of us take ourselves less seriously. _Humor is the divine antidote for exaltation of ego_. <a id="s78_360"></a>[UB 48:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_15) 

> Humor should function as an automatic safety valve to prevent the building up of excessive pressures due to the monotony of sustained and serious self-contemplation in association with the intense struggle for developmental progress and noble achievement. Humor also functions to lessen the shock of the unexpected impact of fact or of truth, rigid unyielding fact and flexible ever-living truth. The mortal personality, never sure as to which will next be encountered, through humor swiftly grasps — sees the point and achieves insight — the unexpected nature of the situation be it fact or be it truth. <a id="s80_607"></a>[UB 48:4.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_18) 

We are given relative free will. That is, there are provisos relating to capacities, welfare, time, and monitored outcomes. An unrestricted will that may demand rights harmful to self and others, is unacceptable.

> You are not given unrestricted choice as to your future course; but you may choose within the limits of that which the transition ministers and their superiors wisely determine to be most suitable for your future spirit attainment. The spirit world is governed on the principle of respecting your freewill choice provided the course you may choose is not detrimental to you or injurious to your fellows. <a id="s84_406"></a>[UB 48:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_6) 

Determination, dedication, diligence. If we have given our best we find it easier to accept disappointment. More importantly, we are then better equipped to face the next life challenge. An opportunity analysis made easy.

> Sometimes the planting of a seed necessitates its death, the death of your fondest hopes, before it can be reborn to bear the fruits of new life and new opportunity. And from them you will learn to suffer less through sorrow and disappointment, first, by making fewer personal plans concerning other personalities, and then, by accepting your lot when you have faithfully performed your duty. <a id="s88_395"></a>[UB 48:6.36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_36)

It is important to focus on the prevailing tasks of each life stage. This focus will also take away any feeling of self-importance, as that will absorb energy that is better directed to the work to be done.

> You will learn that you increase your burdens and decrease the likelihood of success by taking yourself too seriously. Nothing can take precedence over the work of your status sphere — this world or the next. Very important is the work of preparation for the next higher sphere, but nothing equals the importance of the work of the world in which you are actually living. But though the _work_ is important, the _self_ is not. When you feel important, you lose energy to the wear and tear of ego dignity so that there is little energy left to do the work. Self-importance, not work-importance, exhausts immature creatures; it is the self element that exhausts, not the effort to achieve. You can do important work if you do not become self-important; you can do several things as easily as one if you leave yourself out. Variety is restful; monotony is what wears and exhausts. Day after day is alike — just life or the alternative of death. <a id="s97_944"></a>[UB 48:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_37) 

The organization has a massively important and unparalleled opportunity to foster a better world by contributing to this list of attributes. But what is its current report card showing? What marks do the Most Highs give it? Citizens are learning the truth. Try ranking an organization from 1 to 10 on these five hallmarks of social advancement.

> 1. _Social fraternity_. Multiplication of international and interracial social contacts and fraternal associations through travel, commerce, and competitive play. Development of a common language and the multiplication of multilinguists. The racial and national interchange of students, teachers, industrialists, and religious philosophers.
> 
> 2. _Intellectual cross-fertilization_. Brotherhood is impossible on a world whose inhabitants are so primitive that they fail to recognize the folly of unmitigated selfishness. There must occur an exchange of national and racial literature. Each race must become familiar with the thought of all races; each nation must know the feelings of all nations. Ignorance breeds suspicion, and suspicion is incompatible with the essential attitude of sympathy and love.
> 
>  3. _Ethical awakening_. Only ethical consciousness can unmask the immorality of human intolerance and the sinfulness of fratricidal strife. Only a moral conscience can condemn the evils of national envy and racial jealousy. Only moral beings will ever seek for that spiritual insight which is essential to living the golden rule.
> 
> 4. _Political wisdom_. Emotional maturity is essential to self-control. Only emotional maturity will insure the substitution of international techniques of civilized adjudication for the barbarous arbitrament of war. Wise statesmen will sometime work for the welfare of humanity even while they strive to promote the interest of their national or racial groups. Selfish political sagacity is ultimately suicidal — destructive of all those enduring qualities which insure planetary group survival.
> 
> 5. _Spiritual insight_. The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. Mutual understanding and fraternal love are transcendent civilizers and mighty factors in the world-wide realization of the brotherhood of man. <a id="s109_641"></a>[UB 52:6.3-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_3)

> Someday civil rulers will learn that the Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men. <a id="s111_83"></a>[UB 134:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_3) 

> The rule of the Most Highs, the overcontrollers of political evolution, is a rule designed to foster the greatest good to the greatest number of _all_ men and for the greatest length of time. <a id="s113_194"></a>[UB 134:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_4) 

> Sovereignty is power and it grows by organization. This growth of the organization of political power is good and proper, for it tends to encompass everwidening segments of the total of mankind. But this same growth of political organizations creates a problem at every intervening stage between the initial and natural organization of political power - the family - and the final consummation of political growth - the government of all mankind, by all mankind, and for all mankind. <a id="s115_486"></a>[UB 134:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_5) 

Does your firm practice true or false liberty? Are the people at the top of major corporations - political, industrial, law, religious, educational, military, sporting, media, entertainment, health, construction, goods, and social - practicing true or false liberty? A lot of careful study may be required to answer this. Then consider the far reaching obligations, and the consequences.

> True liberty is the associate of genuine self-respect; false liberty is the consort of selfadmiration. True liberty is the fruit of self-control; false liberty, the assumption of self-assertion. Selfcontrol leads to altruistic service; self-admiration tends towards the exploitation of others for the selfish aggrandizement of such a mistaken individual as is willing to sacrifice righteous attainment for the sake of possessing unjust power over his fellow beings. <a id="s119_468"></a>[UB 54:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_6) 

> There is no error greater than that species of selfdeception which leads intelligent beings to crave the exercise of power over other beings for the purpose of depriving these persons of their natural liberties. The golden rule of human fairness cries out against all such fraud, unfairness, selfishness, and unrighteousness. Only true and genuine liberty is compatible with the reign of love and the ministry of mercy. <a id="s121_422"></a>[UB 54:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_8) 

> How dare the self-willed creature encroach upon the rights of his fellows in the name of personal liberty when the Supreme Rulers of the universe stand back in merciful respect for these prerogatives of will and potentials of personality! No being, in the exercise of his supposed personal liberty, has a right to deprive any other being of those privileges of existence conferred by the Creators and duly respected by all their loyal associates, subordinates, and subjects. <a id="s123_477"></a>[UB 54:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_9) 

> Ethical obligations are innate, divine, and universal. <a id="s125_57"></a>[UB 54:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_4)

In a sense, all corporations are a family business. And all families are a functioning social entity with equivalent business characteristics.

> If an affectionate father of a large family chooses to show mercy to one of his children guilty of grievous wrongdoing, it may well be that the extension of mercy to this misbehaving child will work a temporary hardship upon all the other and well-behaved children. Such eventualities are inevitable; such a risk is inseparable from the reality situation of having a loving parent and of being a member of a family group. Each member of a family profits by the righteous conduct of every other member; likewise must each member suffer the immediate time-consequences of the misconduct of every other member. Families, groups, nations, races, worlds, systems, constellations, and universes are relationships of association which possess individuality; and therefore does every member of any such group, large or small, reap the benefits and suffer the consequences of the rightdoing and the wrongdoing of all other members of the group concerned. <a id="s134_948"></a>[UB 54:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p6_3) 

> Almost everything of lasting value in civilization has its roots in the family. The family was the first successful peace group, the man and woman learning how to adjust their antagonisms while at the same time teaching the pursuits of peace to their children. <a id="s136_263"></a>[UB 68:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_8) 

Does your corporate charter strive towards this ultimate level of material development? This is quite simple to picture, and all people would be likely to agree, it is what they would like to see happening. Imagine how excited we would all be if our leaders and rulers announced these measures.

> Mortal creatures living on a sin-stricken, evildominated, self-seeking, isolated world, such as Urantia, can hardly conceive of the physical perfection, the intellectual attainment, and the spiritual development which characterize these advanced epochs of evolution on a sinless sphere. <a id="s140_289"></a>[UB 55:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_1) 

> The advanced stages of a world settled in light and life represent the acme of evolutionary material development. On these cultured worlds, gone are the idleness and friction of the earlier primitive ages. Poverty and social inequality have all but vanished, degeneracy has disappeared, and delinquency is rarely observed. Insanity has practically ceased to exist, and feeble-mindedness is a rarity. <a id="s142_402"></a>[UB 55:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_2) 

> The economic, social, and administrative status of these worlds is of a high and perfected order. Science, art, and industry flourish, and society is a smoothly working mechanism of high material, intellectual, and cultural achievement. Industry has been largely diverted to serving the higher aims of such a superb civilization. The economic life of such a world has become ethical. <a id="s144_386"></a>[UB 55:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_3) 

> War has become a matter of history, and there are no more armies or police forces. Government is gradually disappearing. Self-control is slowly rendering laws of human enactment obsolete. The extent of civil government and statutory regulation, in an intermediate state of advancing civilization, is in inverse proportion to the morality and spirituality of the citizenship. <a id="s146_377"></a>[UB 55:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_4) 

> Schools are vastly improved and are devoted to the training of mind and the expansion of soul. The art centers are exquisite and the musical organizations superb. The temples of worship with their associated schools of philosophy and experiential religion are creations of beauty and grandeur. The open-air arenas of worship assembly are equally sublime in the simplicity of their artistic appointment. <a id="s148_405"></a>[UB 55:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_5) 

> The provisions for competitive play, humor, and other phases of personal and group achievement are ample and appropriate. A special feature of the competitive activities on such a highly cultured world concerns the efforts of individuals and groups to excel in the sciences and philosophies of cosmology. Literature and oratory flourish, and language is so improved as to be symbolic of concepts as well as to be expressive of ideas. Life is refreshingly simple; man has at last co-ordinated a high state of mechanical development with an inspiring intellectual attainment and has overshadowed both with an exquisite spiritual achievement. The pursuit of happiness is an experience of joy and satisfaction. <a id="s150_709"></a>[UB 55:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_6) 

Avoid outright materialism. We see evidence of its destructive nature. We also see evidence of a balanced alternative.

> Hence materialism, atheism, is the maximation of ugliness, the climax of the finite antithesis of the beautiful. Highest beauty consists in the panorama of the unification of the variations which have been born of preexistent harmonious reality. <a id="s154_248"></a>[UB 56:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_4) 

> Beauty sponsors art, music, and the meaningful rhythms of all human experience. Goodness embraces the sense of ethics, morality, and religion — experiential perfection-hunger. <a id="s156_178"></a>[UB 56:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_10)
