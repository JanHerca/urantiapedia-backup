**YOU WANT REAL WEALTH AND POWER?**

**WELCOME TO THE NEW BUSINESS CONCEPTS.**

- In the business of living, everything has a value. And a cost. And sometimes they are monetary.
- How to survive long term. Really, really long term. Invest in your spiritual bank.
- Balance the rewards of the Triple Bottom Line - the social, environmental, and financial. By adding the spiritual.
- Where it's more co-operative than competitive.
- The greatest interest you'll ever earn is God's. And the business Creator / Owner is entitled to receive interest from us.
- It's about doing business in the new fashioned way.
- Ethical Investing is everyone's business. This planet's our home.
- Every day we are taking a position in the futures market. Our own.
- God isn't doing deals today. Or tomorrow.
- You don't buy it? Try it. Actually you can't buy it.
- Mortal Life. Only one per customer. Limited time only.
- OK it might not be easy. But what an opportunity.
- We are dealing in commodities that have no price, but infinite values.
- It might be your business, but try telling God it's none of his business.
- The perpetrator not the victim ultimately pays for corruption.
- Every meeting, every transaction, every point negotiated, every price, every result, involves God in partnership.
- Big business? Business doesn't get any bigger than this.
- Not international trade. More like interplanetary trade.
- What price eternal life? How much am I bid?
- The Business of Life is an investment in YOURSELF.
