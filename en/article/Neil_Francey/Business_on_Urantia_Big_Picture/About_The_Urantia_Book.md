**The Urantia Book** describes all human beings as belonging to one family, the daughters and sons of one God, the Universal Father.

**The 196 Urantia Papers introduce us to new concepts** about our everascending adventure of knowing and finding God in our friendly and carefully administered universe.

**The writings offer a clear and concise integration** of science, philosophy, and religion. They have the capacity to make a significant contribution to the religious and philosophical thinking of all peoples They have the potential to make the world a better place.

**For over sixty years**, people from around the world have discovered that the teachings have profoundly impressed and changed their lives - inspired and stimulated them to reach new levels of spiritual growth and enhanced living.

**The Urantia Papers do not advocate** a new and organized religion. Their viewpoint builds upon the religious heritages of the past and present, encouraging a living religion based on service to one's fellows, and faith in a personal relationship with a loving God.

**It is the basis** for developing a universal philosophy of living, by living in harmony with each other and desiring to do the will of God.

**We encourage you** to consider its unifying truths that explain life itself. Thankfully we can now explore the concepts on which all other meditations, philosophies and religions are based.

***The Urantia Book*** is available through all established bookstores. It is also available on line in numerous formats.
