These business concepts can be used by any organization or commercial enterprise as a guide to the best possible practice based on the highest human values. An enterprise which applies the principles and concepts described in _The Urantia Book_, is one based on ethics, honesty, the Golden Rule, and fairness, all motivated by the will of God.

The specific religious, political, and social pursuits of the individuals of a business are personal matters. However they will in some way reflect on all aspects of their lives. It therefore follows that a Urantia inspired organization will be built on those values held by the individual.

These guidelines are presented in a practical format so that owners, managers, staff and advisors, can implement them progressively, and in a way suited to each person's understanding and progress.

If individuals and groups of people act in accordance with natural and spiritual law, there is harmony and improved living in a material sense.

An organization can be in disguise. Through public relations, advertising, spin, corporate design, sponsors and paid presenters in advertising and marketing, we can be sold a false image. However, the true caliber of its people, particularly those at the top, will inevitably be revealed. They cannot hide, nor can they pretend to live truth, reflect morality, show genuine fairness, promote goodness, and live selflessly.

The world does not always protect those who believe in goodness and truth. This in turn does not auger well for those running a business. It is as though the demands of successful corporate governance are directly at odds with the truly religious life, when in fact it is easier and simpler just to be truthful.

The words _religion_ and _religious_ are used in these writings in a way somewhat different to common usage. Religion here indicates living and believing according to universal truths, and not to the many humanly manufactured concepts of unscrupulous storytellers and mythmakers who compiled many of our so-called holy books down through the ages and even to the present time.
