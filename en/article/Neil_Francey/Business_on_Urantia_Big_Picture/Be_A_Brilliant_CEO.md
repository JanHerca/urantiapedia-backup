Ten steps to the implementation of these business concepts

1. Realize that the corporate personality can originate in you.
2. Bring others who share a similar concept into your team.
3. Afford people the right to have input, have differing opinions, and have individual paths for their journey with you.
4. Keep morale high at all times by emanating the grace and strength of spirit conviction.
5. Learn about those people who apply negative powers in their worldwide activities, and be aware of their ambitions.
6. Keep well aware of the levels of the public's opinion and its general capacity for welcoming spiritual knowledge.
7. Study the most dependable and comprehensive record of the teachings of Jesus.
8. Live your life in all ways and at all times as your unique expression of the example of the life of Jesus.
9. Act knowing you operate at optimum spirit levels when doing the Father's will.
10. Acquiesce to the mortal condition.

THIS IS A GRADUAL AND LONG TERM DEDICATED PROCESS TO BE ACHIEVED AGAINST POWERFUL COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FORCES. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR BECOMING A BRILLIANT CEO?

REDEFINE THE MEANINGS OF 'LEADER' AND 'LEADERSHIP'. WHAT IS THE NEW ROLE FOR YOU AND YOUR CORPORATION?

WHAT IS SUCCESS IF NOT COMMENSURATE WITH SALARY?

GIVE A PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION OF JESUS' TEACHINGS.
