It is worth taking a moment to put corporate crime into context and demand it account for what it truly is, and what it does to us all. Look carefully and you will find its well disguised iniquitous behavior is all around us.

> There are many ways of looking at sin, but from the universe philosophic viewpoint sin is the attitude of a personality who is knowingly resisting cosmic reality. Error might be regarded as a misconception or distortion of reality. Evil is a partial realization of, or maladjustment to, universe realities. But sin is a purposeful resistance to divine reality — a conscious choosing to oppose spiritual progress — while iniquity consists in an open and persistent defiance of recognized reality and signifies such a degree of personality disintegration as to border on cosmic insanity. [UB 67:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_4) 

> Error suggests lack of intellectual keenness; evil, deficiency of wisdom; sin, abject spiritual poverty; but iniquity is indicative of vanishing personality control. [UB 67:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_5) 

> And when sin has so many times been chosen and so often been repeated, it may become habitual. Habitual sinners can easily become iniquitous, become wholehearted rebels against the universe and all of its divine realities. While all manner of sins may be forgiven, we doubt whether the established iniquiter would ever sincerely experience sorrow for his misdeeds or accept forgiveness for his sins. [UB 67:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_6) 

The highest level of decision making is ever waiting to work with us one on one. There is a spirit fragment that indwells us and mysteriously monitors our life with us to the extent that we allow, and so follow its leadings.

> Education, training, and experience are factors in most of the vital decisions of all evolutionary moral creatures. But it is entirely possible for the indwelling spirit to make direct contact with the decision- determining powers of the human personality so as to empower the fully consecrated will of the creature to perform amazing acts of loyal devotion to the will and the way of the Father in Paradise. [UB 67:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_7) 

What cultural inheritance will your business leave? Is it invigorating the selfmaintenance of civilization? How does it rate on the comparative scale of needs and wants?

> Civilization is a racial acquirement; it is not biologically inherent; hence must all children be reared in an environment of culture, while each succeeding generation of youth must receive anew its education. The superior qualities of civilization — scientific, philosophic, and religious — are not transmitted from one generation to another by direct inheritance. These cultural achievements are preserved only by the enlightened conservation of social inheritance. [UB 68:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p0_2) 

> While the level of intelligence has contributed considerably to the rate of cultural progress, society is essentially designed to lessen the risk element in the individual's mode of living, and it has progressed just as fast as it has succeeded in lessening pain and increasing the pleasure element in life. Thus does the whole social body push on slowly toward the goal of destiny — extinction or survival — depending on whether that goal is self-maintenance or self-gratification. Self-maintenance originates society, while excessive self-gratification destroys civilization. [UB 68:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_2) 

> But today society is top-heavy with the overgrowth of supposed human needs. Occidental civilization of the twentieth century groans wearily under the tremendous overload of luxury and the inordinate multiplication of human desires and longings. Modern society is enduring the strain of one of its most dangerous phases of far-flung interassociation and highly complicated interdependence. [UB 68:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_5)

Do these quotes remind you of anyone you have done business with, elected to office, read about, or know about? It is essential to have insight into the traits and behaviors of the people who are having an influence on our lives.

> If vanity be enlarged to cover pride, ambition, and honor, then we may discern not only how these propensities contribute to the formation of human associations, but how they also hold men together, since such emotions are futile without an audience to parade before. [UB 68:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_10) 

> Vanity contributed mightily to the birth of society; but at the time of these revelations the devious strivings of a vainglorious generation threaten to swamp and submerge the whole complicated structure of a highly specialized civilization. Pleasure-want has long since superseded hunger-want; the legitimate social aims of self-maintenance are rapidly translating themselves into base and threatening forms of self-gratification. Self-maintenance builds society; unbridled self-gratification unfailingly destroys civilization. [UB 68:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_11) 

> Without help from superhuman sources the strain of society breaks down upon reaching certain limits, and these very influences of social mobilization — hunger, love, vanity, and fear — conspire to plunge mankind into war and bloodshed. [UB 68:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p3_4) 

Business is a flow chart of ideas, competition, change, and survival. In the community, the church, the firm. We are each a part of the future planetary conditions. Each of us, being unique, makes a contribution that no one else ever has, ever can, or ever will, be able to do.

> The survival of a society depends chiefly on the progressive evolution of its mores. The process of custom evolution grows out of the desire for experimentation; new ideas are put forward — competition ensues. A progressing civilization embraces the progressive idea and endures; time and circumstance finally select the fitter group for survival. But this does not mean that each separate and isolated change in the composition of human society has been for the better. No! indeed no! for there have been many, many retrogressions in the long forward struggle of Urantia civilization. [UB 68:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p4_7) 

... and also on the farm.

> Work with the soil is not a curse; rather is it the highest blessing to all who are thus permitted to enjoy the most human of all human activities. [UB 66:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_19) 

> And now is industry supplementing agriculture, with consequently increased urbanization and multiplication of nonagricultural groups of citizenship classes. But an industrial era cannot hope to survive if its leaders fail to recognize that even the highest social developments must ever rest upon a sound agricultural basis. [UB 68:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_13) 

> When the land yield is reduced or the population is increased, the inevitable struggle is renewed; the very worst traits of human nature are brought to the surface. The improvement of the land yield, the extension of the mechanical arts, and the reduction of population all tend to foster the development of the better side of human nature. [UB 68:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_4) 

> Frontier society develops the unskilled side of humanity; the fine arts and true scientific progress, together with spiritual culture, have all thrived best in the larger centers of life when supported by an agricultural and industrial population slightly under the land-man ratio. Cities always multiply the power of their inhabitants for either good or evil. [UB 68:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_5) 

Standards of living are totally uneven across the globe. Limits come from a clash of cultures and its manipulation. Another real problem is low standards of living in modern industrialized societies. The controls on domestic product, market indices, rates of return, aggregate demand, supply chains, and so on, are not working.

> The size of the family has always been influenced by the standards of living. The higher the standard the smaller the family, up to the point of established status or gradual extinction. [UB 68:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_6) 

> All down through the ages the standards of living have determined the quality of a surviving population in contrast with mere quantity. Local class standards of living give origin to new social castes, new mores. When standards of living become too complicated or too highly luxurious, they speedily become suicidal. Caste is the direct result of the high social pressure of keen competition produced by dense populations. [UB 68:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_7)

Time to apply some common sense. This comment covers two contentious issues, population and eugenics. Calm discussion is required and scrutiny of counter arguments allowed. Industry is directly involved in both topics.

> From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. Will Urantia rulers have the insight and courage to foster the multiplication of the average or stabilized human being instead of the extremes of the supernormal and the enormously increasing groups of the subnormal? The normal man should be fostered; he is the backbone of civilization and the source of the mutant geniuses of the race. The subnormal man should be kept under society's control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks requiring intelligence above the animal level but making such low-grade demands as to prove veritable slavery and bondage for the higher types of mankind. [UB 68:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_11) 

The individual is more important than the company.

> All human institutions minister to some social need, past or present, notwithstanding that their overdevelopment unfailingly detracts from the worth-whileness of the individual in that personality is overshadowed and initiative is diminished. Man should control his institutions rather than permit himself to be dominated by these creations of advancing civilization. [UB 69:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p1_1) 

Watch those debt levels. Remember the beauty of the simple life.

> Today, men are not social slaves, but thousands allow ambition to enslave them to debt. Involuntary slavery has given way to a new and improved form of modified industrial servitude. [UB 69:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_10) 

The importance of job availability is one of the great contributions of commerce to society. Evidence suggests that governments do not directly create private sector jobs, but rather create certain conditions. Then they devise various ways to tax and constrain their citizens.

> While the ideal of society is universal freedom, idleness should never be tolerated. All able-bodied persons should be compelled to do at least a self-sustaining amount of work. [UB 69:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_11) 

> Modern society is in reverse. Slavery has nearly disappeared; domesticated animals are passing. Civilization is reaching back to fire — the inorganic world — for power. Man came up from savagery by way of fire, animals, and slavery; today he reaches back, discarding the help of slaves and the assistance of animals, while he seeks to wrest new secrets and sources of wealth and power from the elemental storehouse of nature. [UB 69:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_12) 

A history lesson: Have times really changed? If the world is drifting to socialism, then we need to be most watchful indeed. For inherent in it are the seeds not of equality, fair minded freedoms, and security, but elements that undermine the family, race, religion, and the state.

> Primitive communism did not especially level men down, nor did it exalt mediocrity, but it did put a premium on inactivity and idleness, and it did stifle industry and destroy ambition. Communism was indispensable scaffolding in the growth of primitive society, but it gave way to the evolution of a higher social order because it ran counter to four strong human proclivities:
> 
> 1. _The family_. Man not only craves to accumulate property; he desires to bequeath his capital goods to his progeny. But in early communal society a man's capital was either immediately consumed or distributed among the group at his death. There was no inheritance of property - the inheritance tax was one hundred per cent. The later capital-accumulation and propertyinheritance mores were a distinct social advance. And this is true notwithstanding the subsequent gross abuses attendant upon the misuse of capital.
> 
>  2. _Religious tendencies_. Primitive man also wanted to save up property as a nucleus for starting life in the next existence. This motive explains why it was so long the custom to bury a man's personal belongings with him. The ancients believed that only the rich survived death with any immediate pleasure and dignity. The teachers of revealed religion, more especially the Christian teachers, were the first to proclaim that the poor could have salvation on equal terms with the rich.
>
> 3. _The desire for liberty and leisure_. In the earlier days of social evolution the apportionment of individual earnings among the group was virtually a form of slavery; the worker was made slave to the idler. This was the suicidal weakness of communism: The improvident habitually lived off the thrifty. Even in modern times the improvident depend on the state (thrifty taxpayers) to take care of them. Those who have no capital still expect those who have to feed them.
> 
> 4. The urge for security and power. Communism was finally destroyed by the deceptive practices of progressive and successful individuals who resorted to diverse subterfuges in an effort to escape enslavement to the shiftless idlers of their tribes. But at first all hoarding was secret; primitive insecurity prevented the outward accumulation of capital. And even at a later time it was most dangerous to amass too much wealth; the king would be sure to trump up some charge for confiscating a rich man's property, and when a wealthy man died, the funeral was held up until the family donated a large sum to public welfare or to the king, an inheritance tax. [UB 69:9.2-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_2) 

Jobs lead to ownership of private property that is not a policy endorsed by socialism. Clearly their preference is for people to be dependent on the state, even for their belief systems, and the nurture and education of their children.

> Private ownership brought increased liberty and enhanced stability; but private ownership of land was given social sanction only after communal control and direction had failed, and it was soon followed by a succession of slaves, serfs, and landless classes. But improved machinery is gradually setting men free from slavish toil. [UB 69:9.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_16) 

> The right to property is not absolute; it is purely social. But all government, law, order, civil rights, social liberties, conventions, peace, and happiness, as they are enjoyed by modern peoples, have grown up around the private ownership of property. [UB 69:9.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_17) 

> The present social order is not necessarily right — not divine or sacred — but mankind will do well to move slowly in making changes. That which you have is vastly better than any system known to your ancestors. Make certain that when you change the social order you change for the better. Do not be persuaded to experiment with the discarded formulas of your forefathers. Go forward, not backward! Let evolution proceed! Do not take a backward step. [UB 69:9.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_18)

The role of industry can prevent warfare. Therefore we need to be mindful of the opposite agenda, that is, large industrial complex producing armaments and promoting conflict between and within nations. Consider our current position on the six perils listed below. Greed prevents true progress.

> Warfare persists because man is human, evolved from an animal, and all animals are bellicose. [UB 70:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_7) 

> The nations of Urantia have already entered upon the gigantic struggle between nationalistic militarism and industrialism, and in many ways this conflict is analogous to the agelong struggle between the herder-hunter and the farmer. But if industrialism is to triumph over militarism, it must avoid the dangers which beset it. The perils of budding industry on Urantia are:
> 
> 1. The strong drift toward materialism, spiritual blindness.
> 2. The worship of wealthpower, value distortion.
> 3. The vices of luxury, cultural immaturity.
> 4. The increasing dangers of indolence, service insensitivity.
> 5. The growth of undesirable racial softness, biologic deterioration.
> 6. The threat of standardized industrial slavery, personality stagnation. Labor is ennobling but drudgery is benumbing. [UB 70:2.11-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_11) 

Great industry leaders promote peace. Not just talk it. Fair international trade, education and communication, and the application of reasonable profit, all with inter-related benefits, are contributing factors to a peaceful world.

> But even in passing, war should be honored as the school of experience which compelled a race of arrogant individualists to submit themselves to highly concentrated authority — a chief executive. Old-fashioned war did select the innately great men for leadership, but modern war no longer does this. To discover leaders society must now turn to the conquests of peace: industry, science, and social achievement. [UB 70:2.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_21) 

> The peace of Urantia will be promoted far more by international trade organizations than by all the sentimental sophistry of visionary peace planning. Trade relations have been facilitated by development of language and by improved methods of communication as well as by better transportation. [UB 70:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p3_4) 

> The absence of a common language has always impeded the growth of peace groups, but money has become the universal language of modern trade. Modern society is largely held together by the industrial market. The gain motive is a mighty civilizer when augmented by the desire to serve. [UB 70:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p3_5) 

Market research, surveys, opinion polls, majority rule, all have a role in trend analysis. But how reliable are they? Are they to confirm a vested position? What is the sample size, target audience, who commissioned, who paid?

> Public opinion, common opinion, has always delayed society; nevertheless, it is valuable, for, while retarding social evolution, it does preserve civilization. Education of public opinion is the only safe and true method of accelerating civilization; force is only a temporary expedient, and cultural growth will increasingly accelerate as bullets give way to ballots. Public opinion, the mores, is the basic and elemental energy in social evolution and state development, but to be of state value it must be nonviolent in expression. [UB 71:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_7) 

> The measure of the advance of society is directly determined by the degree to which public opinion can control personal behavior and state regulation through nonviolent expression. The really civilized government had arrived when public opinion was clothed with the powers of personal franchise. Popular elections may not always decide things rightly, but they represent the right way even to do a wrong thing. Evolution does not at once produce superlative perfection but rather comparative and advancing practical adjustment. [UB 71:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_8) 

Check the evolution and nature of competition. This little essay outlines the difficulty of getting the right balance of competition between firms. Its legacy can swing from social progress to loss of liberty.

> Competition is essential to social progress, but competition, unregulated, breeds violence. In current society, competition is slowly displacing war in that it determines the individual's place in industry, as well as decreeing the survival of the industries themselves. (Murder and war differ in their status before the mores, murder having been outlawed since the early days of society, while war has never yet been outlawed by mankind as a whole.) [UB 71:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p5_1) 

> The ideal state undertakes to regulate social conduct only enough to take violence out of individual competition and to prevent unfairness in personal initiative. Here is a great problem in statehood: How can you guarantee peace and quiet in industry, pay the taxes to support state power, and at the same time prevent taxation from handicapping industry and keep the state from becoming parasitical or tyrannical? [UB 71:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p5_2) 

> Throughout the earlier ages of any world, competition is essential to progressive civilization. As the evolution of man progresses, cooperation becomes increasingly effective. In advanced civilizations co-operation is more efficient than competition. Early man is stimulated by competition. Early evolution is characterized by the survival of the biologically fit, but later civilizations are the better promoted by intelligent co-operation, understanding fraternity, and spiritual brotherhood. [UB 71:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p5_3) 

> True, competition in industry is exceedingly wasteful and highly ineffective, but no attempt to eliminate this economic lost motion should be countenanced if such adjustments entail even the slightest abrogation of any of the basic liberties of the individual. [UB 71:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p5_4) 

The straight out profit motive has a 'use by' date. Plan your corporate strategy for true success beyond that date. Good companies have a stock of nonprofit motives. Naturally it all has to be balanced for shorter term survival, otherwise there can be not be any longer term gains.

> Present-day profit-motivated economics is doomed unless profit motives can be augmented by service motives. Ruthless competition based on narrow-minded self-interest is ultimately destructive of even those things which it seeks to maintain. Exclusive and self-serving profit motivation is incompatible with Christian ideals — much more incompatible with the teachings of Jesus. [UB 71:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_1) 

> In economics, profit motivation is to service motivation what fear is to love in religion. But the profit motive must not be suddenly destroyed or removed; it keeps many otherwise slothful mortals hard at work. It is not necessary, however, that this social energy arouser be forever selfish in its objectives. [UB 71:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_2) 

> The profit motive of economic activities is altogether base and wholly unworthy of an advanced order of society; nevertheless, it is an indispensable factor throughout the earlier phases of civilization. Profit motivation must not be taken away from men until they have firmly possessed themselves of superior types of nonprofit motives for economic striving and social serving — the transcendent urges of superlative wisdom, intriguing brotherhood, and excellency of spiritual attainment. [UB 71:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_3)

Part of the solution is to educate. Then embrace culture to elevate. All the while maintaining a harmonious balance of the seven points listed below.

> Urantians should get a vision of a new and higher cultural society. Education will jump to new levels of value with the passing of the purely profitmotivated system of economics. Education has too long been localistic, militaristic, ego exalting, and success seeking; it must eventually become world-wide, idealistic, self-realizing, and cosmic grasping. [UB 71:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p7_3) 

> Education recently passed from the control of the clergy to that of lawyers and businessmen. Eventually it must be given over to the philosophers and the scientists. Teachers must be free beings, real leaders, to the end that philosophy, the search for wisdom, may become the chief educational pursuit. [UB 71:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p7_4) 

> Education is the business of living; it must continue throughout a lifetime so that mankind may gradually experience the ascending levels of mortal wisdom, which are:
> 
> 1. The knowledge of things.
> 2. The realization of meanings.
> 3. The appreciation of values.
> 4. The nobility of work — duty.
> 5. The motivation of goals — morality.
> 6. The love of service — character.
> 7. Cosmic insight — spiritual discernment. [UB 71:7.5-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p7_5) 

This government model could be replicated as a business model based on:
1. A group representative of all employees
2. Representatives from associated organizations
3. Wise and knowledgeable older people

> The legislative division embraces three houses:
> 
> 1. The _upper house_ is elected by industrial, professional, agricultural, and other groups of workers, balloting in accordance with economic function.
> 2. The _lower house_ is elected by certain organizations of society embracing the social, political, and philosophic groups not included in industry or the professions. All citizens in good standing participate in the election of both classes of representatives, but they are differently grouped, depending on whether the election pertains to the upper or lower house.
> 3. The _third house_ — the elder statesmen embraces the veterans of civic service and includes many distinguished persons nominated by the chief executive, by the regional (subfederal) executives, by the chief of the supreme tribunal, and by the presiding officers of either of the other legislative houses. [UB 72:2.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_4) 

Here are some comments about industrial relations on an advanced planet. It all sounds rather sensible and familiar. The ideal result is to implement measures that give benefits and fairness to all of the stakeholders.

> The industrial situation among this people is far from their ideals; capital and labor still have their troubles, but both are becoming adjusted to the plan of sincere co-operation. On this unique continent the workers are increasingly becoming shareholders in all industrial concerns; every intelligent laborer is slowly becoming a small capitalist. [UB 72:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_1) 

> Social antagonisms are lessening, and good will is growing apace. [UB 72:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_2) 

> These people have recently developed new techniques for the adjustment of industrial misunderstandings and for the correction of economic abuses which are marked improvements over their older methods of settling such problems. Violence has been outlawed as a procedure in adjusting either personal or industrial differences. Wages, profits, and other economic problems are not rigidly regulated, but they are in general controlled by the industrial legislatures, while all disputes arising out of industry are passed upon by the industrial courts. [UB 72:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_3) 

> The industrial courts are only thirty years old but are functioning very satisfactorily. The most recent development provides that hereafter the industrial courts shall recognize legal compensation as falling in three divisions:
> 
> 1. Legal rates of interest on invested capital.
> 2. Reasonable salary for skill employed in industrial operations.
> 3. Fair and equitable wages for labor. [UB 72:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_4) 

> These shall first be met in accordance with contract, or in the face of decreased earnings they shall share proportionally in transient reduction. And thereafter all earnings in excess of these fixed charges shall be regarded as dividends and shall be prorated to all three divisions: capital, skill, and labor. [UB 72:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_8) 

Advanced ideas on work attitudes are essential for developing a concept of, and preference for, life balance.

> Among this people public service is rapidly becoming the chief goal of ambition. The richest man on the continent works six hours a day in the office of his machine shop and then hastens over to the local branch of the school of statesmanship, where he seeks to qualify for public service. [UB 72:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_10) 

> Labor is becoming more honorable on this continent, and all able-bodied citizens over eighteen work either at home and on farms, at some recognized industry, on the public works where the temporarily unemployed are absorbed, or else in the corps of compulsory laborers in the mines. [UB 72:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_11) 

> These people are also beginning to foster a new form of social disgust — disgust for both idleness and unearned wealth. Slowly but certainly they are conquering their machines. Once they, too, struggled for political liberty and subsequently for economic freedom. Now are they entering upon the enjoyment of both while in addition they are beginning to appreciate their wellearned leisure, which can be devoted to increased self-realization. [UB 72:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p5_12) 

Rejoice with this perspective on conflict. We need to look far beyond the hour.

> If this were a mechanistic universe, if the First Great Source and Center were only a force and not also a personality, if all creation were a vast aggregation of physical matter dominated by precise laws characterized by unvarying energy actions, then might perfection obtain, even despite the incompleteness of universe status. There would be no disagreement; there would be no friction. But in our evolving universe of relative perfection and imperfection we rejoice that disagreement and misunderstanding are possible, for thereby is evidenced the fact and the act of personality in the universe. And if our creation is an existence dominated by personality, then can you be assured of the possibilities of personality survival, advancement, and achievement; we can be confident of personality growth, experience, and adventure. What a glorious universe, in that it is personal and progressive, not merely mechanical or even passively perfect! [UB 75:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p8_7)

An advanced standard of living is necessary for having time to relax and time to think. This in turn generates further returns with improved culture, education, and planning. No doubt this will also have a direct correlation with our spiritual natures and its potentials.

> You who now live amid latter-day scenes of budding culture and beginning progress in social affairs, who actually have some little spare time in which to _think_ about society and civilization, must not overlook the fact that your early ancestors had little or no leisure which could be devoted to thoughtful reflection and social thinking. [UB 81:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_2) 

> Civilization can never flourish, much less be established, until man has _leisure_ to think, to plan, to imagine new and better ways of doing things. [UB 81:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_14) 

> _Capital goods_. Culture is never developed under conditions of poverty; leisure is essential to the progress of civilization. Individual character of moral and spiritual value may be acquired in the absence of material wealth, but a cultural civilization is only derived from those conditions of material prosperity which foster leisure combined with ambition. [UB 81:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_6) 

> But the continent richest in natural deposits and the most advanced mechanical equipment will make little progress if the intelligence of its people is on the decline. Knowledge can be had by education, but wisdom, which is indispensable to true culture, can be secured only through experience and by men and women who are innately intelligent. Such a people are able to learn from experience; they may become truly wise. [UB 81:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_13) 

More than any other influence in earlier times, trading advanced civilization. Trading arrangements in the modern world will likewise advance, or conversely seriously undermine, advantages that have recently been won.

> The increase in trade and in the manufacture of raw materials into various articles of commerce was directly instrumental in producing those early and semipeaceful communities which were so influential in spreading the culture and the arts of civilization. Before the era of extensive world trade, social communities were tribal — expanded family groups. Trade brought into fellowship different sorts of human beings, thus contributing to a more speedy cross-fertilization of culture. [UB 81:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_2) 

> With the appearance of crude manufacture and beginning industry, commerce quickly became the most potent influence in the spread of cultural civilization. The opening up of the trade channels by land and by sea greatly facilitated travel and the mixing of cultures as well as the blending of civilizations. [UB 81:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_6) 

> The traveling trader and the roving explorer did more to advance historic civilization than all other influences combined. Military conquests, colonization, and missionary enterprises fostered by the later religions were also factors in the spread of culture; but these were all secondary to the trading relations, which were ever accelerated by the rapidly developing arts and sciences of industry. [UB 81:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_7) 

Here is why economic progress is so important. It can elevate (conversely debase) mankind. While it does make the world a better place there are responsibilities attached. Those who benefit without contributing must recognize the group protection and co-operative sharing it needs to bestow.

> Through agriculture, animal domestication, and improved architecture, mankind gradually escaped the worst of the incessant struggle to live and began to cast about to find wherewith to sweeten the process of living; and this was the beginning of the striving for higher and ever higher standards of material comfort. Through manufacture and industry man is gradually augmenting the pleasure content of mortal life. [UB 81:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_2) 

> But cultural society is no great and beneficent club of inherited privilege into which all men are born with free membership and entire equality. Rather is it an exalted and ever-advancing guild of earth workers, admitting to its ranks only the nobility of those toilers who strive to make the world a better place in which their children and their children's children may live and advance in subsequent ages. And this guild of civilization exacts costly admission fees, imposes strict and rigorous disciplines, visits heavy penalties on all dissenters and nonconformists, while it confers few personal licenses or privileges except those of enhanced security against common dangers and racial perils. [UB 81:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_3) 

> Social association is a form of survival insurance which human beings have learned is profitable; therefore are most individuals willing to pay those premiums of self-sacrifice and personal-liberty curtailment which society exacts from its members in return for this enhanced group protection. In short, the present-day social mechanism is a trial-anderror insurance plan designed to afford some degree of assurance and protection against a return to the terrible and antisocial conditions which characterized the early experiences of the human race. [UB 81:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_4) 

> Society thus becomes a co-operative scheme for securing civil freedom through institutions, economic freedom through capital and invention, social liberty through culture, and freedom from violence through police regulation. [UB 81:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_5) 

Corporations can produce wealth, hence material power. Do the rights of the citizens ultimately wield the greater might? We have to believe that people power can exert more sway than corporate power over all forms of legislation. But secrecy, misinformation, and greed, can long delay the awareness, motivation, and determination of the populace to preserve itself.

> _Might does not make right, but it does enforce the commonly recognized rights of each succeeding generation_. The prime mission of government is the definition of the right, the just and fair regulation of class differences, and the enforcement of equality of opportunity under the rules of law. Every human right is associated with a social duty; group privilege is an insurance mechanism which unfailingly demands the full payment of the exacting premiums of group service. And group rights, as well as those of the individual, must be protected, including the regulation of the sex propensity. [UB 81:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_6) 

> Liberty subject to group regulation is the legitimate goal of social evolution. Liberty without restrictions is the vain and fanciful dream of unstable and flighty human minds. [UB 81:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p5_7) 

> _Effectiveness of material resources_. Much depends on the wisdom displayed in the utilization of natural resources, scientific knowledge, capital goods, and human potentials. The chief factor in early civilization was the _force_ exerted by wise social masters; primitive man had civilization literally thrust upon him by his superior contemporaries. Well-organized and superior minorities have largely ruled this world. [UB 81:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_14) 

> Might does not make right, but might does make what is and what has been in history. Only recently has Urantia reached that point where society is willing to debate the ethics of might and right. [UB 81:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_15) 

International relations are exceedingly beneficial. But confusion exists about the suitability of various models being offered as a world government. For one example, is English emerging as the international language enhancing crosscultural relationships and eliminating misunderstandings?

> Language is man's greatest and most serviceable thinking tool, but it never flourished until social groups acquired some leisure. The tendency to play with language develops new words — slang. If the majority adopt the slang, then usage constitutes it language. [UB 81:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_17) 

> The conquest of dialects must precede the spread of a culture throughout a race, over a continent, or to a whole world. A universal language promotes peace, insures culture, and augments happiness. [UB 81:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_18) 

> While very little progress has been made on Urantia toward developing an international language, much has been accomplished by the establishment of international commercial exchange. And all these international relations should be fostered, whether they involve language, trade, art, science, competitive play, or religion. [UB 81:6.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_19)

Industrialization needs to be our liberator and not an enslaver of mankind. But do we know the current real agendas of big business?

> _Effectiveness of mechanical devices_. The progress of civilization is directly related to the development and possession of tools, machines, and channels of distribution. Improved tools, ingenious and efficient machines, determine the survival of contending groups in the arena of advancing civilization. [UB 81:6.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_20) 

> In the early days the only energy applied to land cultivation was man power. It was a long struggle to substitute oxen for men since this threw men out of employment. Latterly, machines have begun to displace men, and every such advance is directly contributory to the progress of society because it liberates man power for the accomplishment of more valuable tasks. [UB 81:6.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_21) 

> Science, guided by wisdom, may become man's great social liberator. A mechanical age can prove disastrous only to a nation whose intellectual level is too low to discover those wise methods and sound techniques for successfully adjusting to the transition difficulties arising from the sudden loss of employment by large numbers consequent upon the too rapid invention of new types of laborsaving machinery. [UB 81:6.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_22) 

Money has not made education available to all (quantity). Nor has it resulted in the basics being taught (quality)? Even worse perhaps is that it can be used for social engineering or for political and religious indoctrination.

> The greatest twentieth-century influences contributing to the furtherance of civilization and the advancement of culture are the marked increase in world travel and the unparalleled improvements in methods of communication. But the improvement in education has not kept pace with the expanding social structure; neither has the modern appreciation of ethics developed in correspondence with growth along more purely intellectual and scientific lines. And modern civilization is at a standstill in spiritual development and the safeguarding of the home institution. [UB 81:6.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_25) 

Where, or from whom, can we learn values? The material components of a society cannot lay claim to this honour. But in an advancing society, they can, and do, provide the bottom rungs of the spiritual climb.

> Ideals elevate the source of the social stream. And no stream will rise any higher than its source no matter what technique of pressure or directional control may be employed. The driving power of even the most material aspects of a cultural civilization is resident in the least material of society's achievements. Intelligence may control the mechanism of civilization, wisdom may direct it, but spiritual idealism is the energy which really uplifts and advances human culture from one level of attainment to another. [UB 81:6.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_27) 

> At first life was a struggle for existence; now, for a standard of living; next it will be for quality of thinking, the coming earthly goal of human existence. [UB 81:6.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_28) 

With increasing specialization in the labor force, improved methods of communicating and the sharing of skills and knowledge become paramount. And once again, we are warned about the drawbacks of not doing so.

> _Co-ordination of specialists_. Civilization has been enormously advanced by the early division of labor and by its later corollary of specialization. Civilization is now dependent on the effective co-ordination of specialists. As society expands, some method of drawing together the various specialists must be found. [UB 81:6.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_29) 

> Social, artistic, technical, and industrial specialists will continue to multiply and increase in skill and dexterity. And this diversification of ability and dissimilarity of employment will eventually weaken and disintegrate human society if effective means of co-ordination and co-operation are not developed. But the intelligence which is capable of such inventiveness and such specialization should be wholly competent to devise adequate methods of control and adjustment for all problems resulting from the rapid growth of invention and the accelerated pace of cultural expansion. [UB 81:6.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_30) 

Jobs, jobs, jobs. We all want to contribute in some way to our society. This directly gives a sense of a worthwhile life and a feeling of being of service to others. Needless to say, labor regulated by force is never effective.

> _Place-finding devices_. The next age of social development will be embodied in a better and more effective cooperation and co-ordination of ever-increasing and expanding specialization. And as labor more and more diversifies, some technique for directing individuals to suitable employment must be devised. Machinery is not the only cause for unemployment among the civilized peoples of Urantia. Economic complexity and the steady increase of industrial and professional specialism add to the problems of labor placement. [UB 81:6.31](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_31) 

> It is not enough to train men for work; in a complex society there must also be provided efficient methods of place finding. Before training citizens in the highly specialized techniques of earning a living, they should be trained in one or more methods of commonplace labor, trades or callings which could be utilized when they were transiently unemployed in their specialized work. No civilization can survive the long-time harboring of large classes of unemployed. In time, even the best of citizens will become distorted and demoralized by accepting support from the public treasury. Even private charity becomes pernicious when long extended to able-bodied citizens. [UB 81:6.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_32) 

> Such a highly specialized society will not take kindly to the ancient communal and feudal practices of olden peoples. True, many common services can be acceptably and profitably socialized, but highly trained and ultraspecialized human beings can best be managed by some technique of intelligent cooperation. Modernized coordination and fraternal regulation will be productive of longer-lived co-operation than will the older and more primitive methods of communism or dictatorial regulative institutions based on force. [UB 81:6.33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_33) 

Fairness and co-operation lead to a cohesive society. And it needs to be applied across the world. This is simple to know but not so simple to achieve, unless intelligence, good sense, and the highest of ideals prevail.

> _The willingness to co-operate_. One of the great hindrances to the progress of human society is the conflict between the interests and welfare of the larger, more socialized human groups and of the smaller, contrary-minded asocial associations of mankind, not to mention antisocially-minded single individuals. [UB 81:6.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_34) 

> No national civilization long endures unless its educational methods and religious ideals inspire a high type of intelligent patriotism and national devotion. Without this sort of intelligent patriotism and cultural solidarity, all nations tend to disintegrate as a result of provincial jealousies and local self-interests. [UB 81:6.35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_35) 

> The maintenance of world-wide civilization is dependent on human beings learning how to live together in peace and fraternity. Without effective co-ordination, industrial civilization is jeopardized by the dangers of ultraspecialization: monotony, narrowness, and the tendency to breed distrust and jealousy. [UB 81:6.36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_36)

Corrupt leadership can bring down a company and even a country. Or leadership can be a force for a good and orderly civilization. Our task is to spot the fakes. And to have a form of government that represents the people.

> _Effective and wise leadership_. In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective loadpulling spirit. Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together — all at the same moment. And such teamwork — social cooperation — is dependent on leadership. The cultural civilizations of the past and the present have been based upon the intelligent cooperation of the citizenry with wise and progressive leaders; and until man evolves to higher levels, civilization will continue to be dependent on wise and vigorous leadership. [UB 81:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_37) 

> High civilizations are born of the sagacious correlation of material wealth, intellectual greatness, moral worth, social cleverness, and cosmic insight. [UB 81:6.38](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_38) 

> Leadership is vital to progress. Wisdom, insight, and foresight are indispensable to the endurance of nations. Civilization is never really jeopardized until able leadership begins to vanish. And the quantity of such wise leadership has never exceeded one per cent of the population. [UB 81:6.42](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_42) 

Social progress is effective when the foundations remain in place - family, home, laws, true religion, stable government, economy, and good business governance. How effective are these stabilities today? More important is the effect of their rates of change. Rapidity leads to chaos and confusion.

> _Social changes_. Society is not a divine institution; it is a phenomenon of progressive evolution; and advancing civilization is always delayed when its leaders are slow in making those changes in the social organization which are essential to keeping pace with the scientific developments of the age. For all that, things must not be despised just because they are old, neither should an idea be unconditionally embraced just because it is novel and new. [UB 81:6.39](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_39) 

> Man should be unafraid to experiment with the mechanisms of society. But always should these adventures in cultural adjustment be controlled by those who are fully conversant with the history of social evolution; and always should these innovators be counseled by the wisdom of those who have had practical experience in the domains of contemplated social or economic experiment. _No great social or economic change should be attempted suddenly_. Time is essential to all types of human adjustment — physical, social, or economic. Only moral and spiritual adjustments can be made on the spur of the moment, and even these require the passing of time for the full outworking of their material and social repercussions. The ideals of the race are the chief support and assurance during the critical times when civilization is in transit from one level to another. [UB 81:6.40](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_40) 

History keeps repeating (or as it has been said: rhyming). Agrarian, industrial, technical, financial, political, and on it goes. The message of Jesus still falls on deaf ears. It is being blocked from becoming the key to a better world.

> _The prevention of transitional breakdown_. Society is the offspring of age upon age of trial and error; it is what survived the selective adjustments and readjustments in the successive stages of mankind's agelong rise from animal to human levels of planetary status. The great danger to any civilization — at any one moment — is the threat of breakdown during the time of transition from the established methods of the past to those new and better, but untried, procedures of the future. [UB 81:6.41](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_41)

Social and business conduct, and the advent of individual freedom, must not undermine family life. These forces should act as protectors of this rich heritage, and be actively associated in the functioning of the ideal home.

> The humans of olden times did not possess a very rich social civilization, but such as they had they faithfully and effectively passed on to the next generation. And you should recognize that most of these civilizations of the past continued to evolve with a bare minimum of other institutional influences because the home was effectively functioning. Today the human races possess a rich social and cultural heritage, and it should be wisely and effectively passed on to succeeding generations. The family as an educational institution must be maintained. [UB 82:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_3) 

> Monogamy is the yardstick which measures the advance of social civilization as distinguished from purely biologic evolution. Monogamy is not necessarily biologic or natural, but it is indispensable to the immediate maintenance and further development of social civilization. It contributes to a delicacy of sentiment, a refinement of moral character, and a spiritual growth which are utterly impossible in polygamy. A woman never can become an ideal mother when she is all the while compelled to engage in rivalry for her husband's affections. [UB 83:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p6_7) 

> The social pressure of community standing and property privileges has always been potent in the maintenance of the marriage taboos and mores. Down through the ages marriage has made steady progress and stands on advanced ground in the modern world, notwithstanding that it is threateningly assailed by widespread dissatisfaction among those peoples where individual choice — a new liberty — figures most largely. While these upheavals of adjustment appear among the more progressive races as a result of suddenly accelerated social evolution, among the less advanced peoples marriage continues to thrive and slowly improve under the guidance of the older mores. [UB 83:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_4) 

Organizations are collectives of people all subject to the changing benchmarks of acceptable behavior and working conditions. Adaptability while maintaining high values is the key. And the social institution of marriage is particularly susceptible to rapidly changing mores. And today, that institution and the relationships therein are under increasing pressures.

> The presence of large numbers of unmarried persons in any society indicates the temporary breakdown or the transition of the mores. [UB 83:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_5) 

> The real test of marriage, all down through the ages, has been that continuous intimacy which is inescapable in all family life. Two pampered and spoiled youths, educated to expect every indulgence and full gratification of vanity and ego, can hardly hope to make a great success of marriage and home building — a lifelong partnership of self-effacement, compromise, devotion, and unselfish dedication to child culture. [UB 83:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_6) 

> The high degree of imagination and fantastic romance entering into courtship is largely responsible for the increasing divorce tendencies among modern Occidental peoples, all of which is further complicated by woman's greater personal freedom and increased economic liberty. Easy divorce, when the result of lack of self-control or failure of normal personality adjustment, only leads directly back to those crude societal stages from which man has emerged so recently and as the result of so much personal anguish and racial suffering. [UB 83:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_7) 

> And in so far as the social group falls short of providing marriage preparation for youths, to that extent must divorce function as the social safety valve which prevents still worse situations during the ages of the rapid growth of the evolving mores. [UB 83:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_8) 

> The youthful idealization of marriage should not, however, be discouraged; such dreams are the visualization of the future goal of family life. This attitude is both stimulating and helpful providing it does not produce an insensitivity to the realization of the practical and commonplace requirements of marriage and subsequent family life. [UB 83:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_7)

The role and status of women in the home, the school, and the workplace, is another barometer of civilization.

> The mother and child relation is natural, strong, and instinctive ... This compelling mother love is the handicapping emotion which has always placed woman at such a tremendous disadvantage in all her struggles with man. Even at that, maternal instinct in the human species is not overpowering; it may be thwarted by ambition, selfishness, and religious conviction. [UB 84:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_7) 

> A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women. This pairing of the sexes enhanced survival and was the very beginning of human society. The sex division of labor also made for comfort and increased happiness. [UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9) 

> It was a great step forward when male captives were no longer killed but were enslaved as agriculturists. This brought about the liberation of woman so that she could devote more time to homemaking and child culture. [UB 84:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_8) 

> Generally speaking, during any age woman's status is a fair criterion of the evolutionary progress of marriage as a social institution, while the progress of marriage itself is a reasonably accurate gauge registering the advances of human civilization. [UB 84:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_1) 

We have to get our equalities right and our rights equivalent. There is no alternative. Otherwise there are untapped resources, unnecessary exclusions, and entitlements that are unearned and unlearned.

> The modern idea of sex equality is beautiful and worthy of an expanding civilization, but it is not found in nature. When might is right, man lords it over woman; when more justice, peace, and fairness prevail, she gradually emerges from slavery and obscurity. Woman's social position has generally varied inversely with the degree of militarism in any nation or age. [UB 84:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_3) 

> The advancing mores slowly provided increasingly better treatment for females; those tribes which persisted in cruelty to them did not survive. [UB 84:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_4) 

> Science, not religion, really emancipated woman; it was the modern factory which largely set her free from the confines of the home. Man's physical abilities became no longer a vital essential in the new maintenance mechanism; science so changed the conditions of living that man power was no longer so superior to woman power. [UB 84:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_7) 

But beware! These rights bring responsibilities. How will the exertion of an individual's right resonate with the wider community? What is the benefit if one person's right takes away the right of another person? Then there is the person's spiritual welfare and their role longer term as a universal citizen.

> These changes have tended toward woman's liberation from domestic slavery and have brought about such a modification of her status that she now enjoys a degree of personal liberty and sex determination that practically equals man's. Once a woman's value consisted in her foodproducing ability, but invention and wealth have enabled her to create a new world in which to function — spheres of grace and charm. Thus has industry won its unconscious and unintended fight for woman's social and economic emancipation. And again has evolution succeeded in doing what even revelation failed to accomplish. [UB 84:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_8) 

> Every easement of the struggle for existence has redounded to the liberation of woman, and she has directly benefited from every advance toward monogamy. The weaker always makes disproportionate gains in every adjustment of the mores in the progressive evolution of society. [UB 84:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_9) 

> In the ideals of pair marriage, woman has finally won recognition, dignity, independence, equality, and education; but will she prove worthy of all this new and unprecedented accomplishment? Will modern woman respond to this great achievement of social liberation with idleness, indifference, barrenness, and infidelity? Today, in the twentieth century, woman is undergoing the crucial test of her long world existence! [UB 84:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_10) 

Celebrate and reinforce our natural differences. The natural combination of man and woman offers superior potentials. Those who would ridicule or confuse the roles need to explain their reasoning.

> Each sex has its own distinctive sphere of existence, together with its own rights within that sphere. If woman aspires literally to enjoy all of man's rights, then, sooner or later, pitiless and emotionless competition will certainly replace that chivalry and special consideration which many women now enjoy, and which they have so recently won from men. [UB 84:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_12) 

> Civilization never can obliterate the behavior gulf between the sexes. From age to age the mores change, but instinct never. Innate maternal affection will never permit emancipated woman to become man's serious rival in industry. Forever each sex will remain supreme in its own domain, domains determined by biologic differentiation and by mental dissimilarity. [UB 84:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_13) 

> The differences of nature, reaction, viewpoint, and thinking between men and women, far from occasioning concern, should be regarded as highly beneficial to mankind, both individually and collectively. [UB 84:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_5) 

It is a permanent and essential design, never to be obliterated.

> Men and women need each other in their morontial and spiritual as well as in their mortal careers. The differences in viewpoint between male and female persist even beyond the first life and throughout the local and superuniverse ascensions. And even in Havona, the pilgrims who were once men and women will still be aiding each other in the Paradise ascent. Never, even in the Corps of the Finality, will the creature metamorphose so far as to obliterate the personality trends that humans call male and female; always will these two basic variations of humankind continue to intrigue, stimulate, encourage, and assist each other; always will they be mutually dependent on cooperation in the solution of perplexing universe problems and in the overcoming of manifold cosmic difficulties. [UB 84:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_6)

Self-interest, chance, fear. These are not a basis for good business practice.

> Man naturally tends to believe that which he deems best for him, that which is in his immediate or remote interest; selfinterest largely obscures logic. The difference between the minds of savage and civilized men is more one of content than of nature, of degree rather than of quality. [UB 86:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_4) 

> But to continue to ascribe things difficult of comprehension to supernatural causes is nothing less than a lazy and convenient way of avoiding all forms of intellectual hard work. Luck is merely a term coined to cover the inexplicable in any age of human existence; it designates those phenomena which men are unable or unwilling to penetrate. Chance is a word which signifies that man is too ignorant or too indolent to determine causes. Men regard a natural occurrence as an accident or as bad luck only when they are destitute of curiosity and imagination, when the races lack initiative and adventure. Exploration of the phenomena of life sooner or later destroys man's belief in chance, luck, and so-called accidents, substituting therefor a universe of law and order wherein all effects are preceded by definite causes. Thus is the fear of existence replaced by the joy of living. [UB 86:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_5) 

Wise decision making is based on indicators of truth. We have gone from putting our faith on luck, rocks, the sun, and even saints, to relying on the state, commercial reorganization, and the lottery, to resolve our lot in life.

> Modern society is removing the business of insurance from the realm of priests and religion, placing it in the domain of economics. [UB 86:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p7_2) 

> Modern civilized races are just emerging from ghost fear as an explanation of luck and the commonplace inequalities of existence. Mankind is achieving emancipation from the bondage of the ghost-spirit explanation of ill luck. But while men are giving up the erroneous doctrine of a spirit cause of the vicissitudes of life, they exhibit a surprising willingness to accept an almost equally fallacious teaching which bids them attribute all human inequalities to political misadaptation, social injustice, and industrial competition. But new legislation, increasing philanthropy, and more industrial reorganization, however good in and of themselves, will not remedy the facts of birth and the accidents of living. Only comprehension of facts and wise manipulation within the laws of nature will enable man to get what he wants and to avoid what he does not want. Scientific knowledge, leading to scientific action, is the only antidote for socalled accidental ills. [UB 86:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p7_4) 

> Industry, war, slavery, and civil government arose in response to the social evolution of man in his natural environment; religion similarly arose as his response to the illusory environment of the imaginary ghost world. Religion was an evolutionary development of self-maintenance, and it has worked, notwithstanding that it was originally erroneous in concept and utterly illogical. [UB 86:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p7_5) 

Humanity, and that includes business, can no longer disregard the absolute truth of all existence and activity. Corporate symbols and slogans are fine but a higher symbolism is also needed. And that symbol is the home, for it alone signifies permanence.

> Modern man must find some adequate symbolism for his new and expanding ideas, ideals, and loyalties. This enhanced symbol must arise out of religious living, spiritual experience. And this higher symbolism of a higher civilization must be predicated on the concept of the Fatherhood of God and be pregnant with the mighty ideal of the brotherhood of man. [UB 87:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_6) 

> No cult can endure and contribute to the progress of social civilization and individual spiritual attainment unless it is based on the biologic, sociologic, and religious significance of the _home_. A surviving cult must symbolize that which is permanent in the presence of unceasing change; it must glorify that which unifies the stream of ever-changing social metamorphosis. It must recognize true meanings, exalt beautiful relations, and glorify the good values of real nobility. [UB 87:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_8) 

The chairman, the CEO, the head of church or state, has no divine right. The majority vote in the boardroom, the surveys of public opinion, and the functioning of a democracy, exhibit only mediocre judgment at best.

> The insignia of priestly and kingly office were eventually regarded as fetishes, and the fetish of the state supreme has passed through many stages of development, from clans to tribes, from suzerainty to sovereignty, from totems to flags. Fetish kings have ruled by “divine right,” and many other forms of government have obtained. Men have also made a fetish of democracy, the exaltation and adoration of the common man's ideas when collectively called “public opinion.” One man's opinion, when taken by itself, is not regarded as worth much, but when many men are collectively functioning as a democracy, this same mediocre judgment is held to be the arbiter of justice and the standard of righteousness. [UB 88:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p3_4) 

It seems there have always been those who want to partake of the rewards of someone else's hard work.

> But a world so filled with charms did much to destroy all personal ambition and initiative. The fruits of extra labor or of diligence were looked upon as magical. If a man had more grain in his field than his neighbor, he might be haled before the chief and charged with enticing this extra grain from the indolent neighbor's field. Indeed, in the days of barbarism it was dangerous to know very much; there was always the chance of being executed as a black artist. [UB 88:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_6) 

> Ancient magic was the cocoon of modern science, indispensable in its time but now no longer useful. And so the phantasms of ignorant superstition agitated the primitive minds of men until the concepts of science could be born. Today, Urantia is in the twilight zone of this intellectual evolution. One half the world is grasping eagerly for the light of truth and the facts of scientific discovery, while the other half languishes in the arms of ancient superstition and but thinly disguised magic. [UB 88:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_8) 

In a materialistic sense, it is important for people to engage in ethical prayer. Many business people attend prayer groups. We can only wonder what each of them prays for. Or more importantly, the ethical nature of their prayers.

> No prayer can be ethical when the petitioner seeks for selfish advantage over his fellows. Selfish and materialistic praying is incompatible with the ethical religions which are predicated on unselfish and divine love. All such unethical praying reverts to the primitive levels of pseudo magic and is unworthy of advancing civilizations and enlightened religions. Selfish praying transgresses the spirit of all ethics founded on loving justice. [UB 91:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_1) 

Do not forget the follow up action.

> Prayer must never be so prostituted as to become a substitute for action. All ethical prayer is a stimulus to action and a guide to the progressive striving for idealistic goals of superselfattainment. [UB 91:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_2)

## How often do we seek nothing for ourselves?

> In all your praying be fair; do not expect God to show partiality, to love you more than his other children, your friends, neighbors, even enemies. But the prayer of the natural or evolved religions is not at first ethical, as it is in the later revealed religions. All praying, whether individual or communal, may be either egoistic or altruistic. That is, the prayer may be centered upon the self or upon others. When the prayer seeks nothing for the one who prays nor anything for his fellows, then such attitudes of the soul tend to the levels of true worship. Egoistic prayers involve confessions and petitions and often consist in requests for material favors. Prayer is somewhat more ethical when it deals with forgiveness and seeks wisdom for enhanced self-control. [UB 91:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_3) 

Maybe this is why it does not seem to work.

> While the nonselfish type of prayer is strengthening and comforting, materialistic praying is destined to bring disappointment and disillusionment as advancing scientific discoveries demonstrate that man lives in a physical universe of law and order. [UB 91:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_4) 

It is a sure way to deal with business stress.

> Remember, even if prayer does not change God, it very often effects great and lasting changes in the one who prays in faith and confident expectation. Prayer has been the ancestor of much peace of mind, cheerfulness, calmness, courage, self-mastery, and fair-mindedness in the men and women of the evolving races. [UB 91:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_5) 

Here's a question. As it is so effective, is there some format that corporations can positively implement to engage their people in group prayer? Or perhaps a more realistic question is, how many years or eons are we away from that possibility? And how could results be measured?

> But prayer need not always be individual. Group or congregational praying is very effective in that it is highly socializing in its repercussions. When a group engages in community prayer for moral enhancement and spiritual uplift, such devotions are reactive upon the individuals composing the group; they are all made better because of participation. Even a whole city or an entire nation can be helped by such prayer devotions. Confession, repentance, and prayer have led individuals, cities, nations, and whole races to mighty efforts of reform and courageous deeds of valorous achievement. [UB 91:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p5_2) 

Prayer can be a method for developing a more positive approach to others, and a more satisfying life.

> If you truly desire to overcome the habit of criticizing some friend, the quickest and surest way of achieving such a change of attitude is to establish the habit of praying for that person every day of your life. But the social repercussions of such prayers are dependent largely on two conditions:
> 
> 1. The person who is prayed for should know that he is being prayed for.
> 2. The person who prays should come into intimate social contact with the person for whom he is praying. [UB 91:5.3-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p5_3) 

> No matter how difficult it may be to reconcile the scientific doubtings regarding the efficacy of prayer with the everpresent urge to seek help and guidance from divine sources, never forget that the sincere prayer of faith is a mighty force for the promotion of personal happiness, individual self-control, social harmony, moral progress, and spiritual attainment. [UB 91:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p6_3) 

Ultimately there is no substitute for accomplishment, and hopefully we will be inspired to choose a wise course of action in achieving outcomes. We can tap those powers that reside in the human mind.

> Prayer, even as a purely human practice, a dialogue with one's alter ego, constitutes a technique of the most efficient approach to the realization of those reserve powers of human nature which are stored and conserved in the unconscious realms of the human mind. Prayer is a sound psychologic practice, aside from its religious implications and its spiritual significance. It is a fact of human experience that most persons, if sufficiently hard pressed, will pray in some way to some source of help. [UB 91:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p6_4) 

> Do not be so slothful as to ask God to solve your difficulties, but never hesitate to ask him for wisdom and spiritual strength to guide and sustain you while you yourself resolutely and courageously attack the problems at hand. [UB 91:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p6_5) 

> Modern man is perplexed by the thought of talking things over with God in a purely personal way. Many have abandoned regular praying; they only pray when under unusual pressure — in emergencies. Man should be unafraid to talk to God, but only a spiritual child would undertake to persuade, or presume to change, God. [UB 91:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_8) 

> But real praying does attain reality. Even when the air currents are ascending, no bird can soar except by outstretched wings. Prayer elevates man because it is a technique of progressing by the utilization of the ascending spiritual currents of the universe. [UB 91:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_9) 

There are lots of features of prayer, but the boss always says we have to sell the benefits. Here are some - but they are not necessarily material benefits.

> Genuine prayer adds to spiritual growth, modifies attitudes, and yields that satisfaction which comes from communion with divinity. It is a spontaneous outburst of God-consciousness. [UB 91:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_10) 

> God answers man's prayer by giving him an increased revelation of truth, an enhanced appreciation of beauty, and an augmented concept of goodness. Prayer is a subjective gesture, but it contacts with mighty objective realities on the spiritual levels of human experience; it is a meaningful reach by the human for superhuman values. It is the most potent spiritual-growth stimulus. [UB 91:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_11) 

> Words are irrelevant to prayer; they are merely the intellectual channel in which the river of spiritual supplication may chance to flow. The word value of a prayer is purely autosuggestive in private devotions and sociosuggestive in group devotions. God answers the soul's attitude, not the words. [UB 91:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_12) 

> Prayer is not a technique of escape from conflict but rather a stimulus to growth in the very face of conflict. Pray only for values, not things; for growth, not for gratification. [UB 91:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_13) 

There are conditions attached to all aspects of living, sometimes called codes of practice. Or maybe we can simply say ‘here are a few good tips’.

> If you would engage in effective praying, you should bear in mind the laws of prevailing petitions:
> 
> 1. You must qualify as a potent prayer by sincerely and courageously facing the problems of universe reality. You must possess cosmic stamina.
> 2. You must have honestly exhausted the human capacity for human adjustment. You must have been industrious.
> 3. You must surrender every wish of mind and every craving of soul to the transforming embrace of spiritual growth. You must have experienced an enhancement of meanings and an elevation of values.
> 4. You must make a wholehearted choice of the divine will. You must obliterate the dead center of indecision.
> 5. You not only recognize the Father's will and choose to do it, but you have effected an unqualified consecration, and a dynamic dedication, to the actual doing of the Father's will.
> 6. Your prayer will be directed exclusively for divine wisdom to solve the specific human problems encountered in the Paradise ascension - the attainment of divine perfection.
> 7. And you must have faith — living faith. [UB 91:9.1-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p9_1)

## All promotions need to be merit based.

> But it is only foolish to attempt the too sudden acceleration of religious growth. A race or nation can only assimilate from any advanced religion that which is reasonably consistent and compatible with its current evolutionary status, plus its genius for adaptation. Social, climatic, political, and economic conditions are all influential in determining the course and progress of religious evolution. Social morality is not determined by religion, that is, by evolutionary religion; rather are the forms of religion dictated by the racial morality. [UB 92:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_4) 

Evolutionary religion has had a certain tension in its association and influence on the world of commerce. It gave us some standards but so often the impact has been negative due to misinterpretation, unintentional or otherwise. Now however, some positive results are starting to emerge.

> Religion has handicapped social development in many ways, but without religion there would have been no enduring morality nor ethics, no worth-while civilization. [UB 92:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_6) 

> But while calling attention to the fact that religion was essential to the development and preservation of civilization, it should be recorded that natural religion has also done much to cripple and handicap the very civilization which it otherwise fostered and maintained. Religion has hampered industrial activities and economic development; it has been wasteful of labor and has squandered capital; it has not always been helpful to the family; it has not adequately fostered peace and good will; it has sometimes neglected education and retarded science; it has unduly impoverished life for the pretended enrichment of death. Evolutionary religion, human religion, has indeed been guilty of all these and many more mistakes, errors, and blunders; nevertheless, it did maintain cultural ethics, civilized morality, and social coherence, and made it possible for later revealed religion to compensate for these many evolutionary shortcomings. [UB 92:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_7) 

> Religion facilitated the accumulation of capital; it fostered work of certain kinds; the leisure of the priests promoted art and knowledge; the race, in the end, gained much as a result of all these early errors in ethical technique. [UB 92:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_9) 

Take the best from all of the teachings, whatever the source. Here are some gems from the Buddhist faith.

> Closely linked to the doctrine of suffering and the escape therefrom was the philosophy of the Eightfold Path: right views, aspirations, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and contemplation. It was not Gautama's intention to attempt to destroy all effort, desire, and affection in the escape from suffering; rather was his teaching designed to picture to mortal man the futility of pinning all hope and aspirations entirely on temporal goals and material objectives. It was not so much that love of one's fellows should be shunned as that the true believer should also look beyond the associations of this material world to the realities of the eternal future. [UB 94:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p8_8) 

> The great weakness in the original gospel of Buddhism was that it did not produce a religion of unselfish social service. [UB 94:8.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p8_19) 

> Buddhism is a living, growing religion today because it succeeds in conserving many of the highest moral values of its adherents. It promotes calmness and self-control, augments serenity and happiness, and does much to prevent sorrow and mourning. Those who believe this philosophy live better lives than many who do not. [UB 94:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p9_6) 

> Buddhists have been able to reconcile and correlate the divergencies within their own religious scriptures as well as the differences between their own and many others. It was taught that the small truth was for little minds, the large truth for great minds. [UB 94:11.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_4) 

The social problems of religion: Religious organizations are seen to be similar to big business and a part of the secular corporate industries of the world.

> Religion achieves its highest social ministry when it has least connection with the secular institutions of society. [UB 99:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_1) 

> Conditions of living alter so rapidly that institutional modifications must be greatly accelerated, and religion must accordingly quicken its adaptation to this new and ever-changing social order. [UB 99:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_3) 

> Mechanical inventions and the dissemination of knowledge are modifying civilization; certain economic adjustments and social changes are imperative if cultural disaster is to be avoided. This new and oncoming social order will not settle down complacently for a millennium. The human race must become reconciled to a procession of changes, adjustments, and readjustments. Mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed planetary destiny. [UB 99:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_1) 

Religious groups need to know and act in their true roles in the impending social reconstruction of the world.

> The paramount mission of religion as a social influence is to stabilize the ideals of mankind during these dangerous times of transition from one phase of civilization to another, from one level of culture to another. [UB 99:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_3) 

> A godless humanitarianism is, humanly speaking, a noble gesture, but true religion is the only power which can lastingly increase the responsiveness of one social group to the needs and sufferings of other groups. In the past, institutional religion could remain passive while the upper strata of society turned a deaf ear to the sufferings and oppression of the helpless lower strata, but in modern times these lower social orders are no longer so abjectly ignorant nor so politically helpless. [UB 99:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_5) 

> Religion must not become organically involved in the secular work of social reconstruction and economic reorganization. But it must actively keep pace with all these advances in civilization by making clear-cut and vigorous restatements of its moral mandates and spiritual precepts, its progressive philosophy of human living and transcendent survival. The spirit of religion is eternal, but the form of its expression must be restated every time the dictionary of human language is revised. [UB 99:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_6)

Religion taking the social and economic role of a corporation is a real weakness of institutional religion. As a direct consequence, they neglect their true mission. And become part of the problem they are supposed to address.

> Institutional religion cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction. Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in the present crisis of civilization. [UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1) 

> The religionist is not unsympathetic with social suffering, not unmindful of civil injustice, not insulated from economic thinking, neither insensible to political tyranny. Religion influences social reconstruction directly because it spiritualizes and idealizes the individual citizen. Indirectly, cultural civilization is influenced by the attitude of these individual religionists as they become active and influential members of various social, moral, economic, and political groups. [UB 99:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_3) 

It is the mature character of the citizenry that makes the difference for the home, the society, and the company. It is how we face day to day living and the spiritual content of our deliberations.

> The attainment of a high cultural civilization demands, first, the ideal type of citizen and, then, ideal and adequate social mechanisms wherewith such a citizenry may control the economic and political institutions of such an advanced human society. [UB 99:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_4) 

> True religion is a meaningful way of living dynamically face to face with the commonplace realities of everyday life. But if religion is to stimulate individual development of character and augment integration of personality, it must not be standardized. If it is to stimulate evaluation of experience and serve as a value-lure, it must not be stereotyped. If religion is to promote supreme loyalties, it must not be formalized. [UB 99:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_3) 

> After all, it is what one believes rather than what one knows that determines conduct and dominates personal performances. Purely factual knowledge exerts very little influence upon the average man unless it becomes emotionally activated. But the activation of religion is superemotional, unifying the entire human experience on transcendent levels through contact with, and release of, spiritual energies in the mortal life. [UB 99:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_5) 

Economic progress has not brought contentment and understanding about our true selves. Happiness is a consequence of the joy you bring to another.

> During the psychologically unsettled times of the twentieth century, amid the economic upheavals, the moral crosscurrents, and the sociologic rip tides of the cyclonic transitions of a scientific era, thousands upon thousands of men and women have become humanly dislocated; they are anxious, restless, fearful, uncertain, and unsettled; as never before in the world's history they need the consolation and stabilization of sound religion. In the face of unprecedented scientific achievement and mechanical development there is spiritual stagnation and philosophic chaos. [UB 99:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_6) 

We need to reset our goals with a cosmic perspective. Temporal goals are only one part of the equation. Religion gives insights to social sciences, leading on to political improvement, which in turn can progress economic and industrial advancements. Service will be the common denominator.

> Political science must effect the reconstruction of economics and industry by the techniques it learns from the social sciences and by the insights and motives supplied by religious living. In all social reconstruction religion provides a stabilizing loyalty to a transcendent object, a steadying goal beyond and above the immediate and temporal objective. In the midst of the confusions of a rapidly changing environment mortal man needs the sustenance of a far-flung cosmic perspective. [UB 99:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p7_2) 

> Man can never wisely decide temporal issues or transcend the selfishness of personal interests unless he meditates in the presence of the sovereignty of God and reckons with the realities of divine meanings and spiritual values. [UB 99:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p7_4) 

> Economic necessities tie man up with reality, and personal religious experience brings this same man face to face with the eternal realities of an everexpanding and progressing cosmic citizenship. [UB 99:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p7_5) 

> The goal of human self-realization should be spiritual, not material. The only realities worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal. Mortal man is entitled to the enjoyment of physical pleasures and to the satisfaction of human affections; he is benefited by loyalty to human associations and temporal institutions; but these are not the eternal foundations upon which to build the immortal personality which must transcend space, vanquish time, and achieve the eternal destiny of divine perfection and finaliter service. [UB 100:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_6) 

Here is a formula to address adverse impacts of improper business conduct.

> Temporal securities are vulnerable, but spiritual sureties are impregnable. When the flood tides of human adversity, selfishness, cruelty, hate, malice, and jealousy beat about the mortal soul, you may rest in the assurance that there is one inner bastion, the citadel of the spirit, which is absolutely unassailable; at least this is true of every human being who has dedicated the keeping of his soul to the indwelling spirit of the eternal God. [UB 100:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_7) 

> Such spirit-born individuals are so remotivated in life that they can calmly stand by while their fondest ambitions perish and their keenest hopes crash; they positively know that such catastrophes are but the redirecting cataclysms which wreck one's temporal creations preliminary to the rearing of the more noble and enduring realities of a new and more sublime level of universe attainment. [UB 100:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_8) 

The awareness of values in the entire context of living is essential. It requires us to arrange our thoughts within a particular framework of reference. And that framework must encompass all that is good, true, and beautiful. Then we need to recognize what we can improve, and how it can be done.

> In the contemplation of values you must distinguish between that which _is_ value and that which _has_ value. [UB 100:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_3) 

> Man cannot cause growth, but he can supply favorable conditions. Growth is always unconscious, be it physical, intellectual, or spiritual. Love thus grows; it cannot be created, manufactured, or purchased; it must grow. Evolution is a cosmic technique of growth. Social growth cannot be secured by legislation, and moral growth is not had by improved administration. Man may manufacture a machine, but its real value must be derived from human culture and personal appreciation. Man's sole contribution to growth is the mobilization of the total powers of his personality — living faith. [UB 100:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_7) 

> But the great problem of religious living consists in the task of unifying the soul powers of the personality by the dominance of LOVE. Health, mental efficiency, and happiness arise from the unification of physical systems, mind systems, and spirit systems. Of health and sanity man understands much, but of happiness he has truly realized very little. The highest happiness is indissolubly linked with spiritual progress. Spiritual growth yields lasting joy, peace which passes all understanding. [UB 100:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_3)

Motivation is a topical subject in corporate training. This idea about motivation is worth including in the training manuals. It is also about relationship building.

> You can best discover values in your associates by discovering their motivation. If someone irritates you, causes feelings of resentment, you should sympathetically seek to discern his viewpoint, his reasons for such objectionable conduct. If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love. [UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4) 

> You cannot truly love your fellows by a mere act of the will. Love is only born of thoroughgoing understanding of your neighbor's motives and sentiments. It is not so important to love all men today as it is that each day you learn to love one more human being. If each day or each week you achieve an understanding of one more of your fellows, and if this is the limit of your ability, then you are certainly socializing and truly spiritualizing your personality. Love is infectious, and when human devotion is intelligent and wise, love is more catching than hate. But only genuine and unselfish love is truly contagious. If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity to such an extent that all civilization would be encompassed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man. [UB 100:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_6) 

Transformed individuals enjoy life in a totally unique way.

> The self has surrendered to the intriguing drive of an all-encompassing motivation which imposes heightened selfdiscipline, lessens emotional conflict, and makes mortal life truly worth living. [UB 100:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p6_4) 

> Genuine religion takes nothing away from human existence, but it does add new meanings to all of life; it generates new types of enthusiasm, zeal, and courage. [UB 100:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p6_5) 

> One of the most amazing earmarks of religious living is that dynamic and sublime peace, that peace which passes all human understanding, that cosmic poise which betokens the absence of all doubt and turmoil. Such levels of spiritual stability are immune to disappointment. [UB 100:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p6_6) 

Is it not even more important to have a personal philosophy for your life plan than to brainstorm for your business plan? Yet it is business planning which seems to get all the attention.

> An idea is only a theoretical plan for action, while a positive decision is a validated plan of action. A stereotype is a plan of action accepted without validation. The materials out of which to build a personal philosophy of religion are derived from both the inner and the environmental experience of the individual. The social status, economic conditions, educational opportunities, moral trends, institutional influences, political developments, racial tendencies, and the religious teachings of one's time and place all become factors in the formulation of a personal philosophy of religion. Even the inherent temperament and intellectual bent markedly determine the pattern of religious philosophy. Vocation, marriage, and kindred all influence the evolution of one's personal standards of life. [UB 101:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_1) 

> A philosophy of religion evolves out of a basic growth of ideas plus experimental living as both are modified by the tendency to imitate associates. The soundness of philosophic conclusions depends on keen, honest, and discriminating thinking in connection with sensitivity to meanings and accuracy of evaluation. Moral cowards never achieve high planes of philosophic thinking; it requires courage to invade new levels of experience and to attempt the exploration of unknown realms of intellectual living. [UB 101:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_2) 

Then we start to notice that targets are being met, things are happening. And it can be put to the test with a few key performance indicators.

> Presently new systems of values come into existence; new formulations of principles and standards are achieved; habits and ideals are reshaped; some idea of a personal God is attained, followed by enlarging concepts of relationship thereto. [UB 101:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_3) 

> The acid test for any religious philosophy consists in whether or not it distinguishes between the realities of the material and the spiritual worlds while at the same moment recognizing their unification in intellectual striving and in social serving. A sound religious philosophy does not confound the things of God with the things of Caesar. Neither does it recognize the aesthetic cult of pure wonder as a substitute for religion. [UB 101:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_5) 

> The acceptance of a teaching as true is not faith; that is mere belief. Neither is certainty nor conviction faith. A state of mind attains to faith levels only when it actually dominates the mode of living. [UB 101:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p8_1) 

> Faith has falsified its trust when it presumes to deny realities and to confer upon its devotees assumed knowledge. Faith is a traitor when it fosters betrayal of intellectual integrity and belittles loyalty to supreme values and divine ideals. Faith never shuns the problem-solving duty of mortal living. Living faith does not foster bigotry, persecution, or intolerance. [UB 101:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p8_3) 

For some, the corporate world and ready-made beliefs are an escape from other more demanding realities. Actually it works the other way around. Facing the rigors of the spiritual life make the material hurdles easier.

> Evolutionary man does not naturally relish hard work. To keep pace in his life experience with the impelling demands and the compelling urges of a growing religious experience means incessant activity in spiritual growth, intellectual expansion, factual enlargement, and social service. There is no real religion apart from a highly active personality. Therefore do the more indolent of men often seek to escape the rigors of truly religious activities by a species of ingenious self-deception through resorting to a retreat to the false shelter of stereotyped religious doctrines and dogmas. [UB 102:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_7) 

> Again, there are other types of unstable and poorly disciplined souls who would use the sentimental ideas of religion as an avenue of escape from the irritating demands of living. When certain vacillating and timid mortals attempt to escape from the incessant pressure of evolutionary life, religion, as they conceive it, seems to present the nearest refuge, the best avenue of escape. But it is the mission of religion to prepare man for bravely, even heroically, facing the vicissitudes of life. [UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8) 

> Material feelings, human emotions, lead directly to material actions, selfish acts. Religious insights, spiritual motivations, lead directly to religious actions, unselfish acts of social service and altruistic benevolence. [UB 102:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_3)

A strong faith in itself may not compensate for a lack of abilities such as the power of negotiation, salesmanship, and persuasive argument.

> The God-knowing individual is not one who is blind to the difficulties or unmindful of the obstacles which stand in the way of finding God in the maze of superstition, tradition, and materialistic tendencies of modern times. He has encountered all these deterrents and triumphed over them, surmounted them by living faith, and attained the highlands of spiritual experience in spite of them. But it is true that many who are inwardly sure about God fear to assert such feelings of certainty because of the multiplicity and cleverness of those who assemble objections and magnify difficulties about believing in God. It requires no great depth of intellect to pick flaws, ask questions, or raise objections. But it does require brilliance of mind to answer these questions and solve these difficulties; faith certainty is the greatest technique for dealing with all such superficial contentions. [UB 102:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_6) 

> Man can, intellectually, deny God and yet be morally good, loyal, filial, honest, and even idealistic. ... In such a mortal experience only social fruits are forthcoming, not spiritual. [UB 102:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_4) 

When we pursue higher goals we have to make sure the usual life pressures are at a minimum. There is a stack of evidence showing how harmful stress is, and how it can adversely affect our lives. Yet seekers will face life head on.

> But man is not saved or ennobled by pressure. Spirit growth springs from within the evolving soul. Pressure may deform the personality, but it never stimulates growth. Even educational pressure is only negatively helpful in that it may aid in the prevention of disastrous experiences. Spiritual growth is greatest where all external pressures are at a minimum. ... Man develops best when the pressures of home, community, church, and state are least. But this must not be construed as meaning that there is no place in a progressive society for home, social institutions, church, and state. [UB 103:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_11) 

We are familiar with the expression 'it's all in the mind'. Well it really is. But not in the simplistic or glib way. Mind is the mechanism that arranges life's changes and monitors the continual relating of the material to the spiritual.

> Always must man's inner spirit depend for its expression and self-realization upon the mechanism and technique of the mind. Likewise must man's outer experience of material reality be predicated on the mind consciousness of the experiencing personality. Therefore are the spiritual and the material, the inner and the outer, human experiences always correlated with the mind function and conditioned, as to their conscious realization, by the mind activity. Man experiences matter in his mind; he experiences spiritual reality in the soul but becomes conscious of this experience in his mind. The intellect is the harmonizer and the ever-present conditioner and qualifier of the sum total of mortal experience. Both energy-things and spirit values are colored by their interpretation through the mind media of consciousness. [UB 103:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_6) 

> Reason, wisdom, and faith are man's highest human attainments. Reason introduces man to the world of facts, to things; wisdom introduces him to a world of truth, to relationships; faith initiates him into a world of divinity, spiritual experience. [UB 103:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_6) 

> Faith most willingly carries reason along as far as reason can go and then goes on with wisdom to the full philosophic limit; and then it dares to launch out upon the limitless and never-ending universe journey in the sole company of TRUTH. [UB 103:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_7) 

Mind can safely chart us through the crosscurrents. Getting our vocation right is paramount as it is especially subject to a fast changing world and it makes all the difference when it is happily interrelated to other life abilities, demands, shortcomings, and experiences.

> Mortal man is passing through a great age of expanding horizons and enlarging concepts on Urantia, and his cosmic philosophy must accelerate in evolution to keep pace with the expansion of the intellectual arena of human thought. As the cosmic consciousness of mortal man expands, he perceives the interrelatedness of all that he finds in his material science, intellectual philosophy, and spiritual insight. [UB 104:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p3_2) 

> When Thought Adjusters indwell human minds, they bring with them the model careers, the ideal lives, as determined and foreordained by themselves and the Personalized Adjusters of Divinington, which have been certified by the Personalized Adjuster of Urantia. Thus they begin work with a definite and predetermined plan for the intellectual and spiritual development of their human subjects, but it is not incumbent upon any human being to accept this plan. You are all subjects of predestination, but it is not foreordained that you must accept this divine predestination; you are at full liberty to reject any part or all of the Thought Adjusters' program. It is their mission to effect such mind changes and to make such spiritual adjustments as you may willingly and intelligently authorize, to the end that they may gain more influence over the personality directionization; but under no circumstances do these divine Monitors ever take advantage of you or in any way arbitrarily influence you in your choices and decisions. [UB 110:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_1) 

> What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity. [UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5) 

> Mind is the cosmic instrument on which the human will can play the discords of destruction, or upon which this same human will can bring forth the exquisite melodies of God identification and consequent eternal survival. The Adjuster bestowed upon man is, in the last analysis, impervious to evil and incapable of sin, but mortal mind can actually be twisted, distorted, and rendered evil and ugly by the sinful machinations of a perverse and self-seeking human will. Likewise can this mind be made noble, beautiful, true, and good — actually great — in accordance with the spirit-illuminated will of a Godknowing human being. [UB 111:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_6) 

Our work requires positive social interaction. And work can play a positive role in generating altruistic interests and values beyond our material existence.

> The inner and the outer worlds have a different set of values. Any civilization is in jeopardy when three quarters of its youth enter materialistic professions and devote themselves to the pursuit of the sensory activities of the outer world. Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. [UB 111:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_4) 

> Happiness and joy take origin in the inner life. You cannot experience real joy all by yourself. A solitary life is fatal to happiness. Even families and nations will enjoy life more if they share it with others. [UB 111:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_7) 

The business of the world can destroy, or lead with creative ideas and ideals. It can create change, but how well can it deal with it?

> You cannot completely control the external world - environment. It is the creativity of the inner world that is most subject to your direction because there your personality is so largely liberated from the fetters of the laws of antecedent causation. There is associated with personality a limited sovereignty of will. [UB 111:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_8) 

> Since this inner life of man is truly creative, there rests upon each person the responsibility of choosing as to whether this creativity shall be spontaneous and wholly haphazard or controlled, directed, and constructive. How can a creative imagination produce worthy children when the stage whereon it functions is already preoccupied by prejudice, hate, fears, resentments, revenge, and bigotries? [UB 111:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_9) 

> Ideas may take origin in the stimuli of the outer world, but ideals are born only in the creative realms of the inner world. Today the nations of the world are directed by men who have a superabundance of ideas, but they are poverty-stricken in ideals. That is the explanation of poverty, divorce, war, and racial hatreds. [UB 111:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_10)

Business leaders have a magnified power with a multitude of resources under their control. But as always, with that comes added responsibility. So the seeds they sow are significant. As is the harvest they leave for others to reap.

> When man wishes to modify physical reality, be it himself or his environment, he succeeds to the extent that he has discovered the ways and means of controlling matter and directing energy. Unaided mind is impotent to influence anything material save its own physical mechanism, with which it is inescapably linked. But through the intelligent use of the body mechanism, mind can create other mechanisms, even energy relationships and living relationships, by the utilization of which this mind can increasingly control and even dominate its physical level in the universe. [UB 111:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_5) 

> The expansion of material knowledge permits a greater intellectual appreciation of the meanings of ideas and the values of ideals. A human being can find truth in his inner experience, but he needs a clear knowledge of facts to apply his personal discovery of truth to the ruthlessly practical demands of everyday life. [UB 111:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_7) 

Here's a word or two of caution regarding personality traits sometimes associated with power and position.

> Of all the dangers which beset man's mortal nature and jeopardize his spiritual integrity, pride is the greatest. Courage is valorous, but egotism is vainglorious and suicidal. Reasonable self-confidence is not to be deplored. Man's ability to transcend himself is the one thing which distinguishes him from the animal kingdom. [UB 111:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_9) 

> Pride is deceitful, intoxicating, and sin-breeding whether found in an individual, a group, a race, or a nation. It is literally true, “Pride goes before a fall.” [UB 111:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_10) 

Again we are encouraged to see the difference between the material and the spiritual components of self and life. Ask yourself these questions if you dare.

> Why do you not aid the Adjuster in the task of showing you the spiritual counterpart of all these strenuous material efforts? Why do you not allow the Adjuster to strengthen you with the spiritual truths of cosmic power while you wrestle with the temporal difficulties of creature existence? Why do you not encourage the heavenly helper to cheer you with the clear vision of the eternal outlook of universal life as you gaze in perplexity at the problems of the passing hour? Why do you refuse to be enlightened and inspired by the universe viewpoint while you toil amidst the handicaps of time and flounder in the maze of uncertainties which beset your mortal life journey? Why not allow the Adjuster to spiritualize your thinking, even though your feet must tread the material paths of earthly endeavor? [UB 111:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_3) 

Business is familiar with looking at forecasts, the big picture, and blueprints for the future. These concept frames are only relative to our limited viewpoint.

> Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a _universe frame_ in which to think. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. [UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1) 

> Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension.The understandings of truth, beauty, and goodness, morality, ethics, duty, love, divinity, origin, existence, purpose, destiny, time, space, even Deity, are only relatively true. God is much, much more than a Father, but the Father is man's highest concept of God... [UB 115:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_2) 

Do not believe your company position is your true identity? Your corporate life and associated self-image is only a part of who you really are. The top job, office size, prestigious symbols, or biggest salary, is hardly the pinnacle of greatness or what gets the highest achievement award in the greater scheme of things. The following is a career, a real purpose:

> Men all too often forget that God is the greatest experience in human existence. Other experiences are limited in their nature and content, but the experience of God has no limits save those of the creature's comprehension capacity, and this very experience is in itself capacity enlarging. When men search for God, they are searching for everything. When they find God, they have found everything. The search for God is the unstinted bestowal of love attended by amazing discoveries of new and greater love to be bestowed. [UB 117:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_9) 

> All true love is from God, and man receives the divine affection as he himself bestows this love upon his fellows. Love is dynamic. It can never be captured; it is alive, free, thrilling, and always moving. Man can never take the love of the Father and imprison it within his heart. The Father's love can become real to mortal man only by passing through that man's personality as he in turn bestows this love upon his fellows. [UB 117:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_10) 

> When you find the Father, you will find the great cause of your spiritual ascent in the universes; when you find the Supreme, you will discover the great result of your career of Paradise progression. [UB 117:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_26) 

> The personality of the mortal creature may eternalize by self-identification with the indwelling spirit through the technique of choosing to do the will of the Father. Such a consecration of will is tantamount to the realization of eternity-reality of purpose. [UB 118:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_2) 

The basis of excellent decision making can come from experience, a knowledge of past events. From that we strive to envisage and fashion the best future events. The further back we see correctly, the further forward we can envisage. And hopefully brilliantly evaluate the current situation.

> Experience, concomitants of the lengthening of wisdom, and judgment are the the time unit in mortal experience. As the human mind reckons backward into the past, it is evaluating past experience for the purpose of bringing it to bear on a present situation. As mind reaches out into the future, it is attempting to evaluate the future significance of possible action. And having thus reckoned with both experience and wisdom, the human will exercises judgment-decision in the present, and the plan of action thus born of the past and the future becomes existent. [UB 118:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_4) 

> In the maturity of the developing self, the past and future are brought together to illuminate the true meaning of the present. As the self matures, it reaches further and further back into the past for experience, while its wisdom forecasts seek to penetrate deeper and deeper into the unknown future. And as the conceiving self extends this reach ever further into both past and future, so does judgment become less and less dependent on the momentary present. In this way does decision-action begin to escape from the fetters of the moving present, while it begins to take on the aspects of past-future significance. [UB 118:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_5) 

<figure id="Figure_16" class="image urantiapedia">

</figure>

The beauty of maturity and the long term view give a heightened awareness of the present and its worth. There are inter-relationships in the past-presentfuture mix. Insight to such wholeness makes for better decisions.

> Patience is exercised by those mortals whose time units are short; true maturity transcends patience by a forbearance born of real understanding. [UB 118:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_6) 

> To become mature is to live more intensely in the present, at the same time escaping from the limitations of the present. The plans of maturity, founded on past experience, are coming into being in the present in such manner as to enhance the values of the future. [UB 118:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_7) 

> The time unit of immaturity concentrates meaningvalue into the present moment in such a way as to divorce the present of its true relationship to the not-present — the past-future. The time unit of maturity is proportioned so to reveal the coordinate relationship of pastpresent-future that the self begins to gain insight into the wholeness of events, begins to view the landscape of time from the panoramic perspective of broadened horizons, begins perhaps to suspect the nonbeginning, nonending eternal continuum, the fragments of which are called time. [UB 118:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_8) 

Opportunities are coming along all the time. We decide based on past decisions, take time based actions, and apply the highest values we have. Spirit matters do however, function by a different set of conditions and laws.

> In the mortal life, paths of differential conduct are continually opening and closing, and during the times when choice is possible the human personality is constantly deciding between these many courses of action. Temporal volition is linked to time, and it must await the passing of time to find opportunity for expression. Spiritual volition has begun to taste liberation from the fetters of time, having achieved partial escape from time sequence, and that is because spiritual volition is selfidentifying with the will of God. [UB 118:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p6_6) 

> Volition, the act of choosing, must function within the universe frame which has actualized in response to higher and prior choosing. [UB 118:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p6_7) 

Develop your business in accordance with the mores, all the time pushing the boundaries just ahead of them.

> The slowness of evolution, of human cultural progress, testifies to the effectiveness of that brake — material inertia — which so efficiently operates to retard dangerous velocities of progress. Thus does time itself cushion and distribute the otherwise lethal results of premature escape from the nextencompassing barriers to human action. For when culture advances overfast, when material achievement outruns the evolution of worship-wisdom, then does civilization contain within itself the seeds of retrogression; and unless buttressed by the swift augmentation of experiential wisdom, such human societies will recede from high but premature levels of attainment, and the “dark ages” of the interregnum of wisdom will bear witness to the inexorable restoration of the imbalance between self-liberty and selfcontrol. [UB 118:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_6) 

For all its massive creative power, the world of business and finance has to be governed by the highest motives. This framework of thinking, extending beyond its basic operational practices, will take us all on a majestic journey to a glorious realm we are all co-creating with each other, and God. Our personal plan then is to know and accept God's plan. The universe plan will support all plans directed to the attainment of Light and Life.

> As man shakes off the shackles of fear, as he bridges continents and oceans with his machines, generations and centuries with his records, he must substitute for each transcended restraint a new and voluntarily assumed restraint in accordance with the moral dictates of expanding human wisdom. These self-imposed restraints are at once the most powerful and the most tenuous of all the factors of human civilization — concepts of justice and ideals of brotherhood. Man even qualifies himself for the restraining garments of mercy when he dares to love his fellow men, while he achieves the beginnings of spiritual brotherhood when he elects to mete out to them that treatment which he himself would be accorded, even that treatment which he conceives that God would accord them. [UB 118:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_10) 

> Man does not have unfettered free will; there are limits to his range of choice, but within the radius of this choice his will is relatively sovereign. [UB 118:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p9_2) 

> But what man calls providence is all too often the product of his own imagination, the fortuitous juxtaposition of the circumstances of chance. There is, however, a real and emerging providence in the finite realm of universe existence, a true and actualizing correlation of the energies of space, the motions of time, the thoughts of intellect, the ideals of character, the desires of spiritual natures, and the purposive volitional acts of evolving personalities. [UB 118:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p10_7) 

> But man can even now foretaste this providence in its eternity meanings as he ponders the universe fact that all things, be they good or evil, work together for the advancement of God-knowing mortals in their quest for the Father of all. [UB 118:10.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p10_18) 

> Providence becomes increasingly discernible as men reach upward from the material to the spiritual. The attainment of completed spiritual insight enables the ascending personality to detect harmony in what was theretofore chaos. [UB 118:10.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p10_19) 

> When men pray for providential intervention in the circumstances of life, many times the answer to their prayer is their own changed attitudes toward life. But providence is not whimsical, neither is it fantastic nor magical. It is the slow and sure emergence of the mighty sovereign of the finite universes, whose majestic presence the evolving creatures occasionally detect in their universe progressions. Providence is the sure and certain march of the galaxies of space and the personalities of time toward the goals of eternity, first in the Supreme, then in the Ultimate, and perhaps in the Absolute. And in infinity we believe there is the same providence, and this is the will, the actions, the purpose of the Paradise Trinity thus motivating the cosmic panorama of universes upon universes.
