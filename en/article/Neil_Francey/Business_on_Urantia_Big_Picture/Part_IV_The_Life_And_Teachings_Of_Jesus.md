We start this section with a perfect story to illustrate the example set by Jesus. Can we personally apply this valuable, though unexpected, teaching to a life situation we are currently confronting? And as a worker, not as a boss.

> One of the young men who worked with Jesus one day on the steering paddle became much interested in the words which he dropped from hour to hour as they toiled in the shipyard. When Jesus intimated that the Father in heaven was interested in the welfare of his children on earth, this young Greek, Anaxand, said: “If the Gods are interested in me, then why do they not remove the cruel and unjust foreman of this workshop?” He was startled when Jesus replied, _“Since you know the ways of kindness and value justice, perhaps the Gods have brought this erring man near that you may lead him into this better way. Maybe you are the salt which is to make this brother more agreeable to all other men; that is, if you have not lost your savor. As it is, this man is your master in that his evil ways unfavorably influence you. Why not assert your mastery of evil by virtue of the power of goodness and thus become the master of all relations between the two of you? I predict that the good in you could overcome the evil in him if you gave it a fair and living chance. There is no adventure in the course of mortal existence more enthralling than to enjoy the exhilaration of becoming the material life partner with spiritual energy and divine truth in one of their triumphant struggles with error and evil. It is a marvelous and transforming experience to become the living channel of spiritual light to the mortal who sits in spiritual darkness. If you are more blessed with truth than is this man, his need should challenge you. Surely you are not the coward who could stand by on the seashore and watch a fellow man who could not swim perish! How much more of value is this man's soul floundering in darkness compared to his body drowning in water!”_ <a id="s37_1753"></a>[UB 130:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_4) 

Consider this noble way to approach, engage, and relate to people. Is this the ultimate interpersonal technique?

> _“Ganid, no man is a stranger to one who knows God. In the experience of finding the Father in heaven you discover that all men are your brothers, and does it seem strange that one should enjoy the exhilaration of meeting a newly discovered brother? To become acquainted with one's brothers and sisters, to know their problems and to learn to love them, is the supreme experience of living.”_ <a id="s41_395"></a>[UB 130:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_6) 

Make sure you create an energetic organization. Because there is no survival value in the alternative.

> All static, dead, concepts are potentially evil. The finite shadow of relative and living truth is continually moving. Static concepts invariably retard science, politics, society, and religion. Static concepts may represent a certain knowledge, but they are deficient in wisdom and devoid of truth. But do not permit the concept of relativity so to mislead you that you fail to recognize the co-ordination of the universe under the guidance of the cosmic mind, and its stabilized control by the energy and spirit of the Supreme. <a id="s45_532"></a>[UB 130:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_15)

Here is a remedy for stress. We can all apply this simple 'sufficient for today' remedy. And be friendly. Smile.

> One day when Ganid asked Jesus why he had not devoted himself to the work of a public teacher, he said: _“My son, everything must await the coming of its time. You are born into the world, but no amount of anxiety and no manifestation of impatience will help you to grow up. You must, in all such matters, wait upon time. Time alone will ripen the green fruit upon the tree. Season follows season and sundown follows sunrise only with the passing of time. I am now on the way to Rome with you and your father, and that is sufficient for today. My tomorrow is wholly in the hands of my Father in heaven.”_ <a id="s54_607"></a>[UB 130:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p5_3) 

> When Ganid inquired what one could do to make friends, having noticed that the majority of persons whom they chanced to meet were attracted to Jesus, his teacher said: _“Become interested in your fellows; learn how to love them and watch for the opportunity to do something for them which you are sure they want done,”_ and then he quoted the olden Jewish proverb — _“A man who would have friends must show himself friendly.”_ <a id="s56_429"></a>[UB 130:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p7_2) 

Business for business sake, with no higher qualities, will eventually become a menace to society. Unevolved human behaviors that become fixed and mechanical are always put under pressure, and slow to reform themselves. Jesus gave his never to-be-forgotten statement that 'money cannot love'.

> Unless the moral insight and the spiritual attainment of mankind are proportionately augmented, the unlimited advancement of a purely materialistic culture may eventually become a menace to civilization. A purely materialistic science harbors within itself the potential seed of the destruction of all scientific striving, for this very attitude presages the ultimate collapse of a civilization which has abandoned its sense of moral values and has repudiated its spiritual goal of attainment. <a id="s60_496"></a>[UB 132:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_3) 

> In every age scientists and religionists must recognize that they are on trial before the bar of human need. They must eschew all warfare between themselves while they strive valiantly to justify their continued survival by enhanced devotion to the service of human progress. If the so-called science or religion of any age is false, then must it either purify its activities or pass away before the emergence of a material science or spiritual religion of a truer and more worthy order. <a id="s62_490"></a>[UB 132:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_4) 

> The spiritually blind individual who logically follows scientific dictation, social usage, and religious dogma stands in grave danger of sacrificing his moral freedom and losing his spiritual liberty. Such a soul is destined to become an intellectual parrot, a social automaton, and a slave to religious authority. <a id="s64_317"></a>[UB 132:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_4) 

> Man tends to crystallize science, formulate philosophy, and dogmatize truth because he is mentally lazy in adjusting to the progressive struggles of living, while he is also terribly afraid of the unknown. Natural man is slow to initiate changes in his habits of thinking and in his techniques of living. <a id="s66_307"></a>[UB 132:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_3) 

We need to be aware of this type of business performer.

> To the speaker at the forum he said: _“Your eloquence is pleasing, your logic is admirable, your voice is pleasant, but your teaching is hardly true.”_ <a id="s70_154"></a>[UB 132:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_7) 

This counsel to a rich man gives each of us responsibility for a worthwhile life.

> A certain rich man, a Roman citizen and a Stoic, became greatly interested in Jesus' teaching, having been introduced by Angamon. After many intimate conferences this wealthy citizen asked Jesus what he would do with wealth if he had it, and Jesus answered him: _“I would bestow material wealth for the enhancement of material life, even as I would minister knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual service for the enrichment of the intellectual life, the ennoblement of the social life, and the advancement of the spiritual life. I would administer material wealth as a wise and effective trustee of the resources of one generation for the benefit and ennoblement of the next and succeeding generations.”_ <a id="s74_701"></a>[UB 132:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_1) 

This additional advice was given specifically to one person and is otherwise considered to be general advice. As a standard rule, no one should dictate to others about how they apply or disperse their wealth.

> _And as a help in the study of the sources of your great fortune, I would suggest that you bear in mind the following ten different methods of amassing material wealth:_
> 
> “1. Inherited wealth — riches derived from parents and other ancestors.”
> 
> “2. Discovered wealth — riches derived from the uncultivated resources of mother earth.”
> 
> “3. Trade wealth — riches obtained as a fair profit in the exchange and barter of material goods.”
> 
> “4. Unfair wealth — riches derived from the unfair exploitation or the enslavement of one's fellows.”
> 
> “5. Interest wealth — income derived from the fair and just earning possibilities of invested capital.”
> 
> “6. Genius wealth — riches accruing from the rewards of the creative and inventive endowments of the human mind.”
> 
> “7. Accidental wealth — riches derived from the generosity of one's fellows or taking origin in the circumstances of life.”
> 
> “8. Stolen wealth — riches secured by unfairness, dishonesty, theft, or fraud.”
> 
> “9. Trust funds — wealth lodged in your hands by your fellows for some specific use, now or in the future.”
> 
> “10. Earned wealth — riches derived directly from your own personal labor, the fair and just reward of your own daily efforts of mind and body.” <a id="s98_147"></a>[UB 132:5.2-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_2)

</figure>

In addition to these ten divisions, this further personal advice was given. Obviously its inclusion in the revelation suggests it has meaning for a much wider audience. It is quite lengthy but well worthwhile as the accumulation of money is an integral component of the business of living.

> _“1. As steward of inherited wealth you should consider its sources. You are under moral obligation to represent the past generation in the honest transmittal of legitimate wealth to succeeding generations after subtracting a fair toll for the benefit of the present generation. But you are not obligated to perpetuate any dishonesty or injustice involved in the unfair accumulation of wealth by your ancestors. Any portion of your inherited wealth which turns out to have been derived through fraud or unfairness, you may disburse in accordance with your convictions of justice, generosity, and restitution. The remainder of your legitimate inherited wealth you may use in equity and transmit in security as the trustee of one generation for another. Wise discrimination and sound judgment should dictate your decisions regarding the bequest of riches to your successors.”_
> 
> “2. Everyone who enjoys wealth as a result of discovery should remember that one individual can live on earth but a short season and should, therefore, make adequate provision for the sharing of these discoveries in helpful ways by the largest possible number of his fellow men. While the discoverer should not be denied all reward for efforts of discovery, neither should he selfishly presume to lay claim to all of the advantages and blessings to be derived from the uncovering of nature's hoarded resources.”
> 
> _“3. As long as men choose to conduct the world's business by trade and barter, they are entitled to a fair and legitimate profit. Every tradesman deserves wages for his services; the merchant is entitled to his hire. The fairness of trade and the honest treatment accorded one's fellows in the organized business of the world create many different sorts of profit wealth, and all these sources of wealth must be judged by the highest principles of justice, honesty, and fairness. The honest trader should not hesitate to take the same profit which he would gladly accord his fellow trader in a similar transaction. While this sort of wealth is not identical with individually earned income when business dealings are conducted on a large scale, at the same time, such honestly accumulated wealth endows its possessor with a considerable equity as regards a voice in its subsequent distribution.”_
> 
> _“4. No mortal who knows God and seeks to do the divine will can stoop to engage in the oppressions of wealth. No noble man will strive to accumulate riches and amass wealth-power by the enslavement or unfair exploitation of his brothers in the flesh. Riches are a moral curse and a spiritual stigma when they are derived from the sweat of oppressed mortal man. All such wealth should be restored to those who have thus been robbed or to their children and their children's children. An enduring civilization cannot be built upon the practice of defrauding the laborer of his hire.”_
> 
> _“5. Honest wealth is entitled to interest. As long as men borrow and lend, that which is fair interest may be collected provided the capital lent was legitimate wealth. First cleanse your capital before you lay claim to the interest. Do not become so small and grasping that you would stoop to the practice of usury. Never permit yourself to be so selfish as to employ money-power to gain unfair advantage over your struggling fellows. Yield not to the temptation to take usury from your brother in financial distress.”_
> 
> _“6. If you chance to secure wealth by flights of genius, if your riches are derived from the rewards of inventive endowment, do not lay claim to an unfair portion of such rewards. The genius owes something to both his ancestors and his progeny; likewise is he under obligation to the race, nation, and circumstances of his inventive discoveries; he should also remember that it was as man among men that he labored and wrought out his inventions. It would be equally unjust to deprive the genius of all his increment of wealth. And it will ever be impossible for men to establish rules and regulations applicable equally to all these problems of the equitable distribution of wealth. You must first recognize man as your brother, and if you honestly desire to do by him as you would have him do by you, the commonplace dictates of justice, honesty, and fairness will guide you in the just and impartial settlement of every recurring problem of economic rewards and social justice.”_
> 
> _“7. Except for the just and legitimate fees earned in administration, no man should lay personal claim to that wealth which time and chance may cause to fall into his hands. Accidental riches should be regarded somewhat in the light of a trust to be expended for the benefit of one's social or economic group. The possessors of such wealth should be accorded the major voice in the determination of the wise and effective distribution of such unearned resources. Civilized man will not always look upon all that he controls as his personal and private possession.”_
> 
> _“8. If any portion of your fortune has been knowingly derived from fraud; if aught of your wealth has been accumulated by dishonest practices or unfair methods; if your riches are the product of unjust dealings with your fellows, make haste to restore all these ill-gotten gains to the rightful owners. Make full amends and thus cleanse your fortune of all dishonest riches.”_ <a id="s121_380"></a>[UB 132:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_22) 
> 
> _“9. The trusteeship of the wealth of one person for the benefit of others is a solemn and sacred responsibility. Do not hazard or jeopardize such a trust. Take for yourself of any trust only that which all honest men would allow.”_
> 
> “10. That part of your fortune which represents the earnings of your own mental and physical efforts — if your work has been done in fairness and equity — is truly your own. No man can gainsay your right to hold and use such wealth as you may see fit provided your exercise of this right does not work harm upon your fellows.” <a id="s125_329"></a>[UB 132:5.15-24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_15) 

When contemplating your current life situation, consider this. Are you actually doing what you really want to be doing, even unconsciously? And what are the best partnerships we can enter into? But the really big question is: In the partnership between God and self, what is the true basis of the partnership?

> That which the lad wanted most to do he was unconsciously actually doing. And it was, and is, ever thus. That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father's will. When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do, happen. <a id="s129_446"></a>[UB 132:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9) 

> _“Although you cannot escape the recognition of differential human abilities and endowments in matters intellectual, social, and moral, you should make no such distinctions in the spiritual brotherhood of men when assembled for worship in the presence of God.”_ <a id="s131_264"></a>[UB 133:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p0_3) 

> _“I am absolutely assured that the entire universe is friendly to me — this all-powerful truth I insist on believing with a wholehearted trust in spite of all appearances to the contrary.”_ <a id="s133_192"></a>[UB 133:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_4)

Here are some enlightening and enjoyable homilies. They all have some degree of relevance in a business sense.

> To the Roman centurion he said: _“Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's. The sincere service of God and the loyal service of Caesar do not conflict unless Caesar should presume to arrogate to himself that homage which alone can be claimed by Deity. Loyalty to God, if you should come to know him, would render you all the more loyal and faithful in your devotion to a worthy emperor.”_ <a id="s142_439"></a>[UB 133:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p4_3) 

> To the Greek contractor and builder he said: _“My friend, as you build the material structures of grow a spiritual men, character in the similitude of the divine spirit within your soul. Do not let your achievement as a temporal builder outrun your attainment as a spiritual son of the kingdom of heaven. build While the you mansions of time for another, neglect not to secure your title to the mansions of eternity for yourself. Ever remember, there is a City whose foundations are righteousness and truth, and whose builder and maker is God.”_ <a id="s144_548"></a>[UB 133:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p4_6) 

> To the mistress of the Greek inn he said: _“Minister your hospitality as one who entertains the children of the Most High. Elevate the drudgery of your daily toil to the high levels of a fine art through the increasing realization that you minister to God in the persons whom he indwells by his spirit which has descended to live within the hearts of men, thereby seeking to transform their minds and lead their souls to the knowledge of the Paradise Father of all these bestowed gifts of the divine spirit.”_ <a id="s146_512"></a>[UB 133:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p4_8) 

> To the runaway lad Jesus said: “Remember, there are two things you cannot run away from — God and yourself. Wherever you may go, you take with you yourself and the spirit of the heavenly Father which lives within your heart. My son, stop trying to deceive yourself; settle down to the courageous practice of facing the facts of life; lay firm hold on the assurances of sonship with God and the certainty of eternal life, as I have instructed you. From this day on purpose to be a real man, a man determined to face life bravely and intelligently.” <a id="s148_550"></a>[UB 133:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p4_11) 

Now for some logic and sums made simple. They do not always represent material facts. This can be taken as an indicator of other forces at work.

> Logic is valid in the material world, and mathematics is reliable when limited in its application to physical things; but neither is to be regarded as wholly dependable or infallible when applied to life problems. Life embraces phenomena which are not wholly material. Arithmetic says that, if one man could shear a sheep in ten minutes, ten men could shear it in one minute. That is sound mathematics, but it is not true, for the ten men could not so do it; they would get in one another's way so badly that the work would be greatly delayed. <a id="s152_546"></a>[UB 133:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_5) 

> Mathematics asserts that, if one person stands for a certain unit of intellectual and moral value, ten persons would stand for ten times this value. But in dealing with human personality it would be nearer the truth to say that such a personality association is a sum equal to the square of the number of personalities concerned in the equation rather than the simple arithmetical sum. A social group of human beings in coordinated working harmony stands for a force far greater than the simple sum of its parts. <a id="s154_515"></a>[UB 133:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_6) 

> Quantity may be identified as a fact, thus becoming a scientific uniformity. Quality, being a matter of mind interpretation, represents an estimate of _values_, and must, therefore, remain an experience of the individual. When both science and religion become less dogmatic and more tolerant of criticism, philosophy will then begin to achieve _unity_ in the intelligent comprehension of the universe. <a id="s156_404"></a>[UB 133:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_7) 

> There is unity in the cosmic universe if you could only discern its workings in actuality. The real universe is friendly to every child of the eternal God. The real problem is: How can the finite mind of man achieve a logical, true, and corresponding unity of thought? This universeknowing state of mind can be had only by conceiving that the quantitative fact and the qualitative value have a common causation in the Paradise Father. <a id="s158_437"></a>[UB 133:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_8) 

Promotion was a contentious issue even thousands of years ago. We need to be realistic about outcomes and find ways to rationally accept them. We are also to identify and evaluate those who may misuse a position of authority.

> At noon they talked with a young Phoenician who was homesick and much discouraged; but most of all he was envious of a certain young man who had received promotion over his head. Jesus spoke comforting words to him and quoted the olden Hebrew proverb: _“A man's gift makes room for him and brings him before great men.”_ <a id="s162_323"></a>[UB 133:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p6_2) 

> _“The teacher surely is not without honor in the eyes of a diligent pupil.”_ <a id="s164_79"></a>[UB 133:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p9_1) 

> _“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom. With all your quest for knowledge, get understanding. Exalt wisdom and she will promote you. She will bring you to honor if you will but embrace her.”_ <a id="s166_209"></a>[UB 133:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p9_3) 

> Freewill beings who regard themselves as equals, unless they mutually acknowledge themselves as subject to some supersovereignty, some authority over and above themselves, sooner or later are tempted to try out their ability to gain power and authority over other persons and groups. The concept of equality never brings peace except in the mutual recognition of some overcontrolling influence of supersovereignty. <a id="s168_417"></a>[UB 134:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_9) 

Let's hope this is also true for the workplace. It needs to be a two way street between all levels and all departments. Recognition need not be expected for just 'doing our job'.

> If a prophet is not without honor save in his own country, he is not without understanding appreciation save in his own family. <a id="s172_130"></a>[UB 138:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_2)

Not sure this would be too appreciated at an important meeting or in the business atmosphere of a boardroom.

> The disciples early learned that the Master had a profound respect and sympathetic regard for _every_ human being he met, and they were tremendously impressed by this uniform and unvarying consideration which he so consistently gave to all sorts of men, women, and children. He would pause in the midst of a profound discourse that he might go out in the road to speak good cheer to a passing woman laden with her burden of body and soul. He would interrupt a serious conference with his apostles to fraternize with an intruding child. Nothing ever seemed so important to Jesus as the _individual human_ who chanced to be in his immediate presence. He was master and teacher, but he was more — he was also a friend and neighbor, an understanding comrade. <a id="s181_757"></a>[UB 138:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_9) 

This was a tried, tested, and proven early corporate structure. It refers to the organization of the twelve apostles. Note the time out for relaxation.

> The apostles early organized themselves in the following manner:
> 
> 1. Andrew, the first chosen apostle, was designated chairman and director general of the twelve.
> 2. Peter, James, and John were appointed personal companions of Jesus. They were to attend him day and night, to minister to his physical and sundry needs, and to accompany him on those night vigils of prayer and mysterious communion with the Father in heaven.
> 3. Philip was made steward of the group. It was his duty to provide food and to see that visitors, and even the multitude of listeners at times, had something to eat.
> 4. Nathaniel watched over the needs of the families of the twelve. He received regular reports as to the requirements of each apostle's family and, making requisition on Judas, the treasurer, would send funds each week to those in need.
> 5. Matthew was the fiscal agent of the apostolic corps. It was his duty to see that the budget was balanced, the treasury replenished. If the funds for mutual support were not forthcoming, if donations sufficient to maintain the party were not received, Matthew was empowered to order the twelve back to their nets for a season. But this was never necessary after they began their public work; he always had sufficient funds in the treasurer's hands to finance their activities.
> 6. Thomas was manager of the itinerary. It devolved upon him to arrange lodgings and in a general way select places for teaching and preaching, thereby insuring a smooth and expeditious travel schedule.
> 7. James and Judas the twin sons of Alpheus were assigned to the management of the multitudes. It was their task to deputize a sufficient number of assistant ushers to enable them to maintain order among the crowds during the preaching.
> 8. Simon Zelotes was given charge of recreation and play. He managed the Wednesday programs and also sought to provide for a few hours of relaxation and diversion each day.
> 9. Judas Iscariot was appointed treasurer. He carried the bag. He paid all expenses and kept the books. He made budget estimates for Matthew from week to week and also made weekly reports to Andrew. Judas paid out funds on Andrew's authorization. <a id="s195_249"></a>[UB 138:10.1-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_1) 

Now for a bit of trivia in reference to a Roman soldier's allowance just to lighten things up for a moment. As we are told, it is good to alternate study with relaxation.

> _“You are the salt of the earth, salt with a saving savor. But if this salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.”_ <a id="s199_214"></a>[UB 140:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_2) 

> In Jesus' time salt was precious. It was even used for money. The modern word “salary” is derived from salt. Salt not only flavors food, but it is also a preservative. It makes other things more tasty, and thus it serves by being spent. <a id="s201_239"></a>[UB 140:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_3) 

Right conduct results in a degree of happiness through centeredness. The converse then is also true. And again there are comments about the value of having a good character.

> Strong characters are not derived from _not_ doing wrong but rather from actually doing right. Unselfishness is the badge of human greatness. The highest levels of self-realization are attained by worship and service. The happy and effective person is motivated, not by fear of wrongdoing, but by love of right doing. <a id="s205_320"></a>[UB 140:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_6) 

> An effective philosophy of living is formed by a combination of cosmic insight and the total of one's emotional reactions to the social and economic environment. Remember: While inherited urges cannot be fundamentally modified, emotional responses to such urges can be changed; therefore the moral nature can be modified, character can be improved. In the strong character emotional responses are integrated and coordinated, and thus is produced a unified personality. Deficient unification weakens the moral nature and engenders unhappiness. <a id="s207_545"></a>[UB 140:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_8) 

> Without a worthy goal, life becomes aimless and unprofitable, and much unhappiness results. <a id="s209_94"></a>[UB 140:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_9) 

Beauty is fashioned by the Supreme Creator. We can appreciate it in all its forms. In nature it is free. When made by mortals it does seem to extract a significant price. Generally speaking, we can view beauty as an expression of God through man.

> This home was exquisitely adorned with priceless treasures which he had gathered up here and there on his world travels. When he first thought of inviting Jesus to his home, he feared that the Master might take offense at the sight of these socalled images. But Flavius was agreeably surprised when Jesus entered the home that, instead of rebuking him for having these supposedly idolatrous objects scattered about the house, he manifested great interest in the entire collection and asked many appreciative questions about each object as Flavius escorted him from room to room, showing him all of his favorite statues. <a id="s213_622"></a>[UB 142:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_1) 

> The Master saw that his host was bewildered at his friendly attitude toward art; therefore, when they had finished the survey of the entire collection, Jesus said: _“Because you appreciate the beauty of things created by my Father and fashioned by the artistic hands of man, why should you expect to be rebuked? Because Moses onetime sought to combat idolatry and the worship of false gods, why should all men frown upon the reproduction of grace and beauty?”_ <a id="s215_463"></a>[UB 142:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_2) 

> _“In an age when my Father was not well understood, Moses was justified in his attempts to withstand idolatry, but in the coming age the Father will have been revealed in the life of the Son; and this new revelation of God will make it forever unnecessary to confuse the Creator Father with idols of stone or images of gold and silver. Henceforth, intelligent men may enjoy the treasures of art without confusing such material appreciation of beauty with the worship and service of the Father in Paradise, the God of all things and all beings.”_ <a id="s217_548"></a>[UB 142:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_3)

This admonition is a recurring theme. We are asked to see the equivalent spiritual content and context in everyday matters. Not only is this a simple and practical approach to elevated thinking, but it also takes us into the realm of the superconscious.

> _Will you not allow me to use the earth family as an illustration of divine relationships without so literally applying my teaching to material affairs? In your minds cannot you separate the spiritual realities of the kingdom from the material, social, economic, and political problems of the age? When I speak the language of the spirit, why do you insist on translating my meaning into the language of the flesh just because I presume to employ commonplace and literal relationships for purposes of illustration? My children, I implore that you cease to apply the teaching of the kingdom of the spirit to the sordid affairs of slavery, poverty, houses, and lands, and to the material problems of human equity and justice._ <a id="s226_727"></a>[UB 142:7.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_17) 

Problem solving skills are high of the list of ideal requisites for corporate success. Here we are presented with yet another way — rest and relaxation.

> This was a marvelous occasion in the experience of each of them; they never forgot the day going up the mountain. Throughout the entire trip hardly a word was said about their troubles. Upon reaching the top of the mountain, Jesus seated them about him while he said: “My brethren, you must all learn the value of rest and the efficacy of relaxation. You must realize that the best method of solving some entangled problems is to forsake them for a time. Then when you go back fresh from your rest or worship, you are able to attack your troubles with a clearer head and a steadier hand, not to mention a more resolute heart. Again, many times your problem is found to have shrunk in size and proportions while you have been resting your mind and body.” <a id="s230_756"></a>[UB 143:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_3) 

> The third day when they started down the mountain and back to their camp, a great change had come over them. They had made the important discovery that many human perplexities are in reality nonexistent, that many pressing troubles are the creations of exaggerated fear and the offspring of augmented apprehension. They had learned that all such perplexities are best handled by being forsaken; by going off they had left such problems to solve themselves. <a id="s232_459"></a>[UB 143:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_6) 

There are some things that money cannot buy.

> Many others sought healing for wholly selfish purposes. A rich widow of Tyre, with her retinue, came seeking to be healed of her infirmities, which were many; and as she followed Jesus about through Galilee, she continued to offer more and more money, as if the power of God were something to be purchased by the highest bidder. But never would she become interested in the gospel of the kingdom; it was only the cure of her physical ailments that she sought. <a id="s236_462"></a>[UB 149:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_9) 

Anger is like a stone hurled into a hornet's nest. (<a id="s238_52"></a>[UB 48:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_20))

> _Anger is a material manifestation which represents, in a general way, the measure of the failure of the spiritual nature to gain control of the combined intellectual and physical natures. Anger indicates your lack of tolerant brotherly love plus your lack of self-respect and self-control. Anger depletes the health, debases the mind, and handicaps the spirit teacher of man's soul._ <a id="s240_387"></a>[UB 149:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p4_2) 

More about the importance of wise career choices and the development of a wide range of interests and activities.

> On this same occasion the Master talked to the group about the desirability of possessing well-balanced characters. He recognized that it was necessary for most men to devote themselves to the mastery of some vocation, but he deplored all tendency toward overspecialization, toward becoming narrow-minded and circumscribed in life's activities. He called attention to the fact that any virtue, if carried to extremes, may become a vice. Jesus always preached temperance and taught consistency — proportionate adjustment of life problems. He pointed out that overmuch sympathy and pity may degenerate into serious emotional instability; that enthusiasm may drive on into fanaticism. He discussed one of their former associates whose imagination had led him off into visionary and impractical undertakings. At the same time he warned them against the dangers of the dullness of overconservative mediocrity. <a id="s244_907"></a>[UB 149:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p4_3) 

> While it is true that many men and women must assiduously apply themselves to some definite pursuit as a livelihood vocation, it is nevertheless wholly desirable that human beings should cultivate a wide range of cultural familiarity with life as it is lived on earth. Truly educated persons are not satisfied with remaining in ignorance of the lives and doings of their fellows. <a id="s246_382"></a>[UB 149:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p4_6) 

> _Much of man's sorrow is born of the disappointment of his ambitions and the wounding of his pride. Although men owe a duty to themselves to make the best of their lives on earth, having thus sincerely exerted themselves, they should cheerfully accept their lot and exercise ingenuity in making the most of that which has fallen to their hands. All too many of man's troubles take origin in the fear soil of his own natural heart._ <a id="s248_434"></a>[UB 149:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p5_3) 

In accepting our lot as mentioned above, we can be comforted by the fact that we can achieve greatness in the eyes of God in any earthly occupation.

> _Never forget there is only one adventure which is more satisfying and thrilling than the attempt to discover the will of the living God, and that is the supreme experience of honestly trying to do that divine will. And fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness — justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty._ <a id="s252_656"></a>[UB 155:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_11) 

We know the corporate world is awash with business plans and risk analyses. Perhaps there are also many personal life plans there. I wonder how many include the search for God and being prepared to risk all in the process.

> But do not make the mistake of trying to prove to other men that you have found God; you cannot consciously produce such valid proof, albeit there are two positive and powerful demonstrations of the fact that you are God-knowing, and they are:
>
> 1. The fruits of the spirit of God showing forth in your daily routine life.
>
> 2. The fact that your entire life plan furnishes positive proof that you have unreservedly risked everything you are and have on the adventure of survival after death in the pursuit of the hope of finding the God of eternity, whose presence you have foretasted in time. <a id="s260_272"></a>[UB 155:6.14-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_14)

Then there are the plans that look reasonable but are superficial, as they are not built upon a proper moral and intellectual foundation.

> _But do not make the mistake of the foolish carpenter who wastes valuable time squaring, measuring, and smoothing his worm-eaten and inwardly rotting timber and then, when he has thus bestowed all of his labor upon the unsound beam, must reject it as unfit to enter into the foundations of the building which he would construct to withstand the assaults of time and storm. Let every man make sure that the intellectual and moral foundations of character are such as will adequately support the superstructure of the enlarging and ennobling spiritual nature, which is thus to transform the mortal mind and then, in association with that re-created mind, is to achieve the evolvement of the soul of immortal destiny._ <a id="s269_718"></a>[UB 156:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_2) 

Here again reference is made to the two paths. Material success or failure is not necessarily an indicator of spiritual destiny.

> Forceful ambition, intelligent judgment, and seasoned wisdom are the essentials of material success. Leadership is dependent on natural ability, discretion, will power, and determination. Spiritual destiny is dependent on faith, love, and devotion to truth — hunger and thirst for righteousness — the wholehearted desire to find God and to be like him. <a id="s273_355"></a>[UB 156:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_7) 

> Do not become discouraged by the discovery that you are human. Human nature may tend toward evil, but it is not inherently sinful. Be not downcast by your failure wholly to forget some of your regrettable experiences. The mistakes which you fail to forget in time will be forgotten in eternity. Lighten your burdens of soul by speedily acquiring a long-distance view of your destiny, a universe expansion of your career. <a id="s275_423"></a>[UB 156:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_8) 

> Make not the mistake of estimating the soul's worth by the imperfections of the mind or by the appetites of the body. Judge not the soul nor evaluate its destiny by the standard of a single unfortunate human episode. Your spiritual destiny is conditioned only by your spiritual longings and purposes. <a id="s277_303"></a>[UB 156:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_9) 

Religion, defined as a spiritual experience, offers power and energy that can be directed to resolving social and economic problems. Having realized this profound truth, we then have to remember to continually apply it.

> Religion is the exclusively spiritual experience of the evolving immortal soul of the God-knowing man, but moral power and spiritual energy are mighty forces which may be utilized in dealing with difficult social situations and in solving intricate economic problems. These moral and spiritual endowments make all levels of human living richer and more meaningful. <a id="s281_367"></a>[UB 156:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_10) 

> Believers must increasingly learn how to step aside from the rush of life escape the harassments of material existence — while they refresh the soul, inspire the mind, and renew the spirit by worshipful communion. <a id="s283_216"></a>[UB 156:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_12) 

> God-knowing individuals are not discouraged by misfortune or downcast by disappointment. Believers are immune to the depression consequent upon purely material upheavals; spirit livers are not perturbed by the episodes of the material world. Candidates for eternal life are practitioners of an invigorating and constructive technique for meeting all of the vicissitudes and harassments of mortal living. Every day a true believer lives, he finds it _easier_ to do the right thing. <a id="s285_483"></a>[UB 156:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_13) 

Climbing up the shaky business ladder is easier than the rigorous upward climb of the solid steps to spiritual enrichment.

> Spiritual living mightily increases true self-respect. But self-respect is not selfadmiration. Self-respect is always co-ordinate with the love and service of one's fellows. It is not possible to respect yourself more than you love your neighbor; the one is the measure of the capacity for the other. <a id="s289_303"></a>[UB 156:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_14) 

> Are your ideals sufficiently high to insure your eternal salvation while your ideas are so practical as to render you a useful citizen to function on earth in association with your mortal fellows? In the spirit, your citizenship is in heaven; in the flesh, you are still citizens of the earth kingdoms. Render to the Caesars the things which are material and to God those which are spiritual. <a id="s291_395"></a>[UB 156:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_16) 

> The measure of the spiritual capacity of the evolving soul is your faith in truth and your love for man, but the measure of your human strength of character is your ability to resist the holding of grudges and your capacity to withstand brooding in the face of deep sorrow. Defeat is the true mirror in which you may honestly view your real self. <a id="s293_349"></a>[UB 156:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_17) 

> As you grow older in years and more experienced in the affairs of the kingdom, are you becoming more tactful in dealing with troublesome mortals and more tolerant in living with stubborn associates? Tact is the fulcrum of social leverage, and tolerance is the earmark of a great soul. If you possess these rare and charming gifts, as the days pass you will become more alert and expert in your worthy efforts to avoid all unnecessary social misunderstandings. Such wise souls are able to avoid much of the trouble which is certain to be the portion of all who suffer from lack of emotional adjustment, those who refuse to grow up, and those who refuse to grow old gracefully. <a id="s295_678"></a>[UB 156:5.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_18) 

> The true believer does not grow weary in well-doing just because he is thwarted. Difficulty whets the ardor of the truth lover, while obstacles only challenge the exertions of the undaunted kingdom builder. <a id="s297_209"></a>[UB 156:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_21) 

This little quote sums it all up.

> _Spiritual greatness consists in an understanding love that is Godlike and not in an enjoyment of the exercise of material power for the exaltation of self._ <a id="s301_160"></a>[UB 158:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p6_3)

Be wary of those individuals who would seek to over-ride the judgment of the group. Mind you, groupthink can be dangerous too. And what about the influence of the 'yes men'?

> Thus did Jesus teach the dangers and illustrate the unfairness of sitting in personal judgment upon one's fellows. Discipline must be maintained, justice must be administered, but in all these matters the wisdom of the brotherhood should prevail. Jesus invested legislative and judicial authority in the group, not in the individual. Even this investment of authority in the group must not be exercised as personal authority. There is always danger that the verdict of an individual may be warped by prejudice or distorted by passion. Group judgment is more likely to remove the dangers and eliminate the unfairness of personal bias. Jesus sought always to minimize the elements of unfairness, retaliation, and vengeance. <a id="s305_724"></a>[UB 159:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_6)

This could well belong in a company's policy statement, or in its commitment to fairness, social justice, and duty of care, to employees and the community.

> Make not the mistake of only condemning the wrongs in the lives of your pupils; remember also to accord generous recognition for the most praiseworthy things in their lives. <a id="s314_176"></a>[UB 159:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_3) 

> Take care that you do not wound the self-respect of timid and fearful souls. Do not indulge in sarcasm at the expense of my simple-minded brethren. Be not cynical with my fear-ridden children. Idleness is destructive of self-respect; therefore, admonish your brethren ever to keep busy at their chosen tasks, and put forth every effort to secure work for those who find themselves without employment. <a id="s316_403"></a>[UB 159:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_4) 

> You cannot develop strong characters out of the indulgence of self-pity; honestly endeavor to avoid the deceptive influence of mere fellowship in misery. Extend sympathy to the brave and courageous while you withhold overmuch pity from those cowardly souls who only halfheartedly stand up before the trials of living. Offer not consolation to those who lie down before their troubles without a struggle. Sympathize not with your fellows merely that they may sympathize with you in return. <a id="s318_491"></a>[UB 159:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_11) 

> I do not promise to deliver you from the waters of adversity, but I do promise to go with you through all of them. <a id="s320_117"></a>[UB 159:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_13) 

This is what I call a great deal. And not even one dollar is involved.

> When my children once become selfconscious of the assurance of the divine presence, such a faith will expand the mind, ennoble the soul, reinforce the personality, augment the happiness, deepen the spirit perception, and enhance the power to love and be loved. <a id="s324_263"></a>[UB 159:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_12) 

> Increasing happiness is always the experience of all who are certain about God. <a id="s326_82"></a>[UB 159:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_10) 

Business must always contend with a changing environment. Currently business targets short term gratification. This is at best a survival mechanism for poor people living hand to mouth. Discontent and oppression are sold to, or forced upon, the masses. Look for the motives of those who would destroy the hallmarks of a good society.

> The more complex civilization becomes, the more difficult will become the art of living. The more rapid the changes in social usage, the more complicated will become the task of character development. Every ten generations mankind must learn anew the art of living if progress is to continue. And if man becomes so ingenious that he more rapidly adds to the complexities of society, the art of living will need to be remastered in less time, perhaps every single generation. If the evolution of the art of living fails to keep pace with the technique of existence, humanity will quickly revert to the simple urge of living the attainment of the satisfaction of present desires. Thus will humanity remain immature; society will fail in growing up to full maturity. <a id="s330_766"></a>[UB 160:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_3) 

> Social maturity is equivalent to the degree to which man is willing to surrender the gratification of mere transient and present desires for the entertainment of those superior longings the striving for whose attainment affords the more abundant satisfactions of progressive advancement toward permanent goals. <a id="s332_313"></a>[UB 160:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_4) 

And here is the lousy deal. It's all yours for a dollar. Or two. Or maybe more. It's always for sale.

> When men dare to forsake a life of natural craving for one of adventurous art and uncertain logic, they must expect to suffer the consequent hazards of emotional casualties — conflicts, unhappiness, and uncertainties at least until the time of their attainment of some degree of intellectual and emotional maturity. <a id="s336_318"></a>[UB 160:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_6) 

Commerce provides an excellent playing field for the development of dependable techniques for solving common problems.

> Successful living is nothing more or less than the art of the mastery of dependable techniques for solving common problems. The first step in the solution of any problem is to locate the difficulty, to isolate the problem, and frankly to recognize its nature and gravity. The great mistake is that, when life problems excite our profound fears, we refuse to recognize them. Likewise, when the acknowledgment of our difficulties entails the reduction of our long-cherished conceit, the admission of envy, or the abandonment of deep-seated prejudices, the average person prefers to cling to the old illusions of safety and to the long-cherished false feelings of security. Only a brave person is willing honestly to admit, and fearlessly to face, what a sincere and logical mind discovers. <a id="s340_790"></a>[UB 160:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_7) 

> The wise and effective solution of any problem demands that the mind shall be free from bias, passion, and all other purely personal prejudices which might interfere with the disinterested survey of the actual factors that go to make up the problem presenting itself for solution. The solution of life problems requires courage and sincerity. Only honest and brave individuals are able to follow valiantly through the perplexing and confusing maze of living to where the logic of a fearless mind may lead. And this emancipation of the mind and soul can never be effected without the driving power of an intelligent enthusiasm which borders on religious zeal. It requires the lure of a great ideal to drive man on in the pursuit of a goal which is beset with difficult material problems and manifold intellectual hazards. <a id="s342_823"></a>[UB 160:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_8)

Part of success requires interpersonal skills that resonate with wisdom and grace in order to persuade others of a superior viewpoint. We see many examples of such people. The opposite style can reach high positions but it is costly and unsustainable, causing much distress along the way.

> Even though you are effectively armed to meet the difficult situations of life, you can hardly expect success unless you are equipped with that wisdom of mind and charm of personality which enable you to win the hearty support and co-operation of your fellows. You cannot hope for a large measure of success in either secular or religious work unless you can learn how to persuade your fellows, to prevail with men. You simply must have tact and tolerance. <a id="s351_459"></a>[UB 160:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_9) 

What is this form of meditation? It is aligning higher values with commonsense and practical knowledge to resolve everyday problems. And we have to find ways to apply such techniques so that it begins to come naturally to us.

> But the greatest of all methods of problem solving I have learned from Jesus, your Master. I refer to that which he so consistently practices, and which he has so faithfully taught you, the isolation of worshipful meditation. In this habit of Jesus' going off so frequently by himself to commune with the Father in heaven is to be found the technique, not only of gathering strength and wisdom for the ordinary conflicts of living, but also of appropriating the energy for the solution of the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature. But even correct methods of solving problems will not compensate for inherent defects of personality or atone for the absence of the hunger and thirst for true righteousness. <a id="s355_719"></a>[UB 160:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_10) 

Here is a blueprint for so doing:

> I am deeply impressed with the custom of Jesus in going apart by himself to engage in these seasons of solitary survey of the problems of living; to seek for new stores of wisdom and energy for meeting the manifold demands of social service; to quicken and deepen the supreme purpose of living by actually subjecting the total personality to the consciousness of contacting with divinity; to grasp for possession of new and better methods of adjusting oneself to the ever-changing situations of living existence; to effect those vital reconstructions and readjustments of one's personal attitudes which are so essential to enhanced insight into everything worth while and real; and to do all of this with an eye single to the glory of God to breathe in sincerity your Master's favorite prayer, _“Not my will, but yours, be done.”_ <a id="s359_833"></a>[UB 160:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_11) 

And here are the immediate results:

> This worshipful practice of your Master brings that relaxation which renews the mind; that illumination which inspires the soul; that courage which enables one bravely to face one's problems; that self-understanding which obliterates debilitating fear; and that consciousness of union with divinity which equips man with the assurance that enables him to dare to be Godlike. The relaxation of worship, or spiritual communion as practiced by the Master, relieves tension, removes conflicts, and mightily augments the total resources of the personality. <a id="s363_554"></a>[UB 160:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_12) 

It's worth remembering in the technological age, that we can never escape the over-riding necessity for face-to-face communication. Because we are people, we have personalities. Our true natures are sociable.

> Man develops personality because he can thus communicate with his fellows concerning both ideas and ideals. <a id="s367_110"></a>[UB 160:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_2) 

> It is this ability to communicate and share meanings that constitutes human culture and enables man, through social associations, to build civilizations. Knowledge and wisdom become cumulative because of man's ability to communicate these possessions to succeeding generations. And thereby arise the cultural activities of the race: art, science, religion, and philosophy. <a id="s369_375"></a>[UB 160:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_3)

And where does this lead? To social groupings, material associations of business, and the family. All require varying degrees of personal affection.

> Symbolic communication between human beings predetermines the bringing into existence of social groups. The most effective of all social groups is the family, more particularly the two parents. Personal affection is the spiritual bond which holds together these material associations. Such an effective relationship is also possible between two persons of the same sex, as is so abundantly illustrated in the devotions of genuine friendships. <a id="s373_445"></a>[UB 160:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_4) 

The spirit quickens, enlivens. What is it that depletes our store of energy? What should we be on the lookout to avoid? And what brings great joy into our lives? It all sounds so straightforward that it is easy to overlook the key things that are all around us. And consider spiritual energy.

> _The enthusiasm for living_. Isolation tends to exhaust the energy charge of the soul. Association with one's fellows is essential to the renewal of the zest for life and is indispensable to the maintenance of the courage to fight those battles consequent upon the ascent to the higher levels of human living. Friendship enhances the joys and glorifies the triumphs of life. Loving and intimate human associations tend to rob suffering of its sorrow and hardship of much of its bitterness. The presence of a friend enhances all beauty and exalts every goodness. By intelligent symbols man is able to quicken and enlarge the appreciative capacities of his friends. One of the crowning glories of human friendship is this power and possibility of the mutual stimulation of the imagination. Great spiritual power is inherent in the consciousness of wholehearted devotion to a common cause, mutual loyalty to a cosmic Deity. <a id="s377_923"></a>[UB 160:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_8) 

> How best can I awaken these latent powers for good which lie dormant in your souls? One thing I am sure of: Emotional excitement is not the ideal spiritual stimulus. Excitement does not augment energy; it rather exhausts the powers of both mind and body. Whence then comes the energy to do these great things? Look to your Master. Even now he is out in the hills taking in power while we are here giving out energy. The secret of all this problem is wrapped up in spiritual communion, in worship. From the human standpoint it is a question of combined meditation and relaxation. Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines the capacity for spiritual receptivity. And this interchange of strength for weakness, courage for fear, the will of God for the mind of self, constitutes worship. At least, that is the way the philosopher views it.<a id="s379_868"></a>[UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1)

We have previously mentioned the importance of having a mature personality. Such people are easily recognizable. We like to associate with them. They teach us. They have much to offer in all walks of life.

> When these experiences are frequently repeated, they crystallize into habits, strength-giving and worshipful habits, and such habits eventually formulate themselves into a spiritual character, and such a character is finally recognized by one's fellows as a _mature personality_. These practices are difficult and time-consuming at first, but when they become habitual, they are at once restful and timesaving. The more complex society becomes, and the more the lures of civilization multiply, the more urgent will become the necessity for God-knowing individuals to form such protective habitual practices designed to conserve and augment their spiritual energies. <a id="s388_668"></a>[UB 160:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_2) 

> Another requirement for the attainment of maturity is the co-operative adjustment of social groups to an ever-changing environment. The immature individual arouses the antagonisms of his fellows; the mature man wins the hearty cooperation of his associates, thereby many times multiplying the fruits of his life efforts. <a id="s390_323"></a>[UB 160:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_3) 

> On every mountaintop of intellectual thought are to be found relaxation for the mind, strength for the soul, and communion for the spirit. From such vantage points of high living, man is able to transcend the material irritations of the lower levels of thinking — worry, jealousy, envy, revenge, and the pride of immature personality. <a id="s392_337"></a>[UB 160:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_5) 

In the midst of this philosophical arena, we are also presented with the basics of life. We cannot neglect these necessities while in pursuit of higher planes. Beware of governments and businesses that would deny us these essentials.

> The essentials of the temporal life, as I see them, are: 
> 
> 1. Good physical health.
> 2. Wealth — the goods of life.
> 3. Clear and clean thinking.
> 4. Ability to withstand defeat.
> 5. Ability and skill.
> 6. Culture — education and wisdom. <a id="s403_37"></a>[UB 160:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_2) 

Hard work in itself will not always generate wealth, but it may produce great benefits to others. Additionally, wealth and hard work may not always produce benefits for others. Both sides of this coin need to be considered carefully.

> It requires intelligence to secure one's share of the desirable things of life. It is wholly erroneous to suppose that faithfulness in doing one's daily work will insure the rewards of wealth. Barring the occasional and accidental acquirement of wealth, the material rewards of the temporal life are found to flow in certain well-organized channels, and only those who have access to these channels may expect to be well rewarded for their temporal efforts. Poverty must ever be the lot of all men who seek for wealth in isolated and individual channels. Wise planning, therefore, becomes the one thing essential to worldly prosperity. Success requires not only devotion to one's work but also that one should function as a part of some one of the channels of material wealth. If you are unwise, you can bestow a devoted life upon your generation without material reward; if you are an accidental beneficiary of the flow of wealth, you may roll in luxury even though you have done nothing worth while for your fellow men. <a id="s407_1024"></a>[UB 160:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_10) 

> Ability is that which you inherit, while skill is what you acquire. Life is not real to one who cannot do some one thing well, expertly. Skill is one of the real sources of the satisfaction of living. Ability implies the gift of foresight, farseeing vision. Be not deceived by the tempting rewards of dishonest achievement; be willing to toil for the later returns inherent in honest endeavor. The wise man is able to distinguish between means and ends; otherwise, sometimes overplanning for the future defeats its own high purpose. As a pleasure seeker you should aim always to be a producer as well as a consumer. <a id="s409_618"></a>[UB 160:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_11) 

A quality of greatness is facing and dealing with reality. The labels of success or failure are qualified and defined by the mores of the times. But such labels can cover up failure, rebrand success, and create disillusionment. And true success can be unheralded and unrewarded, but must be known to self.

> But life will become a burden of existence unless you learn how to fail gracefully. There is an art in defeat which noble souls always acquire; you must know how to lose cheerfully; you must be fearless of disappointment. Never hesitate to admit failure. Make no attempt to hide failure under deceptive smiles and beaming optimism. It sounds well always to claim success, but the end results are appalling. Such a technique leads directly to the creation of a world of unreality and to the inevitable crash of ultimate disillusionment. <a id="s413_538"></a>[UB 160:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_13) 

> Success may generate courage and promote confidence, but wisdom comes only from the experiences of adjustment to the results of one's failures. Men who prefer optimistic illusions to reality can never become wise. Only those who face facts and adjust them to ideals can achieve wisdom. Wisdom embraces both the fact and the ideal and therefore saves its devotees from both of those barren extremes of philosophy — the man whose idealism excludes facts and the materialist who is devoid of spiritual outlook. Those timid souls who can only keep up the struggle of life by the aid of continuous false illusions of success are doomed to suffer failure and experience defeat as they ultimately awaken from the dream world of their own imaginations. <a id="s415_747"></a>[UB 160:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_14) 

> And it is in this business of facing failure and adjusting to defeat that the farreaching vision of religion exerts its supreme influence. Failure is simply an educational episode — a cultural experiment in the acquirement of wisdom — in the experience of the God-seeking man who has embarked on the eternal adventure of the exploration of a universe. To such men defeat is but a new tool for the achievement of higher levels of universe reality. <a id="s417_449"></a>[UB 160:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_15) 

> The career of a God-seeking man may prove to be a great success in the light of eternity, even though the whole temporal-life enterprise may appear as an overwhelming failure, provided each life failure yielded the culture of wisdom and spirit achievement. Do not make the mistake of confusing knowledge, culture, and wisdom. They are related in life, but they represent vastly differing spirit values; wisdom ever dominates knowledge and always glorifies culture. <a id="s419_467"></a>[UB 160:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_16) 

Material and spiritual success are not incompatible. Let's take a look at our contemporaries for some examples. How many do we find? Many? A few?

> Thus always it was and forever will be: Men must arrive at their own decisions. There is a certain range of the freedom of choice which mortals may exercise. The forces of the spiritual world will not coerce man; they allow him to go the way of his own choosing. <a id="s423_265"></a>[UB 163:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_8) 

> Riches have nothing directly to do with entrance into the kingdom of heaven, but the _love of wealth does_. The spiritual loyalties of the kingdom are incompatible with servility to materialistic mammon. Man may not share his supreme loyalty to a spiritual ideal with a material devotion. <a id="s425_291"></a>[UB 163:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_10) 

> Jesus never taught that it was wrong to have wealth. ... The Master regarded the wise investment of excess earnings as a legitimate form of insurance against future and unavoidable adversity. ... But there was one economic abuse which he many times condemned, and that was the unfair exploitation of the weak, unlearned, and less fortunate of men by their strong, keen, and more intelligent fellows. Jesus declared that such inhuman treatment of men, women, and children was incompatible with the ideals of the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven. <a id="s427_551"></a>[UB 163:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_11) 

> _“If one's wealth does not invade the precincts of the soul, it is of no consequence in the spiritual life of those who would enter the kingdom.”_ <a id="s429_149"></a>[UB 163:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_3)

Wealth can attract us to material beauty, and also to distractions that can eliminate the spiritual vision.

> _“Happiness comes not from the power of wealth, and joy springs not from riches. Wealth, in itself, is not a curse, but the love of riches many times leads to such devotion to the things of this world that the soul becomes blinded to the beautiful attractions of the spiritual realities of the kingdom of God on earth and to the joys of eternal life in heaven.”_ <a id="s438_365"></a>[UB 165:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_1) 

> _“But never forget that, after all, wealth is unenduring. The love of riches all too often obscures and even destroys the spiritual vision. Fail not to recognize the danger of wealth's becoming, not your servant, but your master.”_ <a id="s440_234"></a>[UB 165:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_6) 

Here are three questions we need to ask ourselves. They sound simple enough, even harmless. But remember, these same three questions will be asked by those on high who will review our life's endeavors.

> _“I have come to judge neither the rich nor the poor, but the lives men live will sit in judgment on all. Whatever else may concern the wealthy in the judgment, at least three questions must be answered by all who acquire great wealth, and these questions are:”_ 
> 
> _“1. How much wealth did you accumulate?”_
> 
> _“2. How did you get this wealth?”_
> 
> _“3. How did you use your wealth?” _<a id="s450_38"></a>[UB 165:4.10-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_10) 

> _“The Father's human children have equal capacity for the reception of material blessings; therefore does he bestow things physical upon the children of men without discrimination. When it comes to the bestowal of spiritual gifts, the Father is limited by man's capacity for receiving these divine endowments. Although the Father is no respecter of persons, in the bestowal of spiritual gifts he is limited by man's faith and by his willingness always to abide by the Father's will.”_ <a id="s452_487"></a>[UB 166:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4_11) 

This is a reference to one of the many parables recounted in the revelation. Each has a central message we are asked to interpret. In the book we learn that there can be many answers with the best not always obvious.

> at the end of this lesson told the parable of the Pharisee and the publican (a tax collector). Said Jesus: _“Men you may deceive by your outward service, but God looks into your souls. What I am telling you is well illustrated by two men who went into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself: ‘O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unlearned, unjust, adulterers, or even like this publican. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift his eyes to heaven but smote his breast, saying, ‘God be merciful to me a sinner.’ I tell you that the publican went home with God's approval rather than the Pharisee, for every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.”_ <a id="s456_874"></a>[UB 167:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p5_1) 

This parable is about the shrewd steward. It is given in a business context and talks of diligence and foresight. It is cleverly expressed although it is an uncompromising tale, again with a central message.

> One evening Simon Zelotes, commenting on one of Jesus' statements, said: “Master, what did you mean when you said today that many of the children of the world are wiser in their generation than are the children of the kingdom since they are skillful in making friends with the mammon of unrighteousness?” Jesus answered: <a id="s460_323"></a>[UB 169:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_1) 

> _Some of you, before you entered the kingdom, were very shrewd in dealing with your business associates. If you were unjust and often unfair, you were nonetheless prudent and farseeing in that you transacted your business with an eye single to your present profit and future safety. Likewise should you now so order your lives in the kingdom as to provide for your present joy while you also make certain of your future enjoyment of treasures laid up in heaven. If you were so diligent in making gains for yourselves when in the service of self, why should you show less diligence in gaining souls for the kingdom since you are now servants of the brotherhood of man and stewards of God?_ <a id="s462_691"></a>[UB 169:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_2) 

> _You may all learn a lesson from the story of a certain rich man who had a shrewd but unjust steward. This steward had not only oppressed his master's clients for his own selfish gain, but he had also directly wasted and squandered his master's funds. When all this finally came to the ears of his master, he called the steward before him and asked the meaning of these rumors and required that he should give immediate accounting of his stewardship and prepare to turn his master's affairs over to another._ <a id="s464_511"></a>[UB 169:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_3) 

> _Now this unfaithful steward began to say to himself: ‘What shall I do since I am about to lose this stewardship? I have not the strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. I know what I will do to make certain that, when I am put out of this stewardship, I will be welcomed into the houses of all who do business with my master.’ And then, calling in each of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He answered, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ Then said the steward, ‘Take your wax board bond, sit down quickly, and change it to fifty.’ Then he said to another debtor, ‘How much do you owe?’ And he replied, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ Then said the steward, 'Take your bond and write fourscore.' And this he did with numerous other debtors. And so did this dishonest steward seek to make friends for himself after he would be discharged from his stewardship. Even his lord and master, when he subsequently found out about this, was compelled to admit that his unfaithful steward had at least shown sagacity in the manner in which he had sought to provide for future days of want and adversity._ <a id="s466_1128"></a>[UB 169:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_4) 

> _And it is in this way that the sons of this world sometimes show more wisdom in their preparation for the future than do the children of light. I say to you who profess to be acquiring treasure in heaven: Take lessons from those who make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, and likewise so conduct your lives that you make eternal friendship with the forces of righteousness in order that, when all things earthly fail, you shall be joyfully received into the eternal habitations._ <a id="s468_493"></a>[UB 169:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_5) 

> _“I affirm that he who is faithful in little will also be faithful in much, while he who is unrighteous in little will also be unrighteous in much. If you have not shown foresight and integrity in the affairs of this world, how can you hope to be faithful and prudent when you are trusted with the stewardship of the true riches of the heavenly kingdom? If you are not good stewards and faithful bankers, if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will be foolish enough to give you great treasure in your own name?”_ <a id="s470_539"></a>[UB 169:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_6) 

> _“And again I assert that no man can serve two masters; either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to one while he despises the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.”_ <a id="s472_198"></a>[UB 169:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p2_7)

Business causes arguments and resentments, it can upset families, and even make enemies. What to do?

> It is in the consideration of the technique of _receiving_ God's forgiveness that the attainment of the righteousness of the kingdom is revealed. Faith is the price you pay for entrance into the family of God; but forgiveness is the act of God which accepts your faith as the price of admission. And the reception of the forgiveness of God by a kingdom believer involves a definite and actual experience and consists in the following four steps, the kingdom steps of inner righteousness:
> 
> 1. God's forgiveness is made actually available and is personally experienced by man just in so far as he forgives his fellows.
> 2. Man will not truly forgive his fellows unless he loves them as himself.
> 3. To thus love your neighbor as yourself _is_ the highest ethics.
> 4. Moral conduct, true righteousness, becomes, then, the natural result of such love. <a id="s486_88"></a>[UB 170:3.3-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_3) 

> It therefore is evident that the true and inner religion of the kingdom unfailingly and increasingly tends to manifest itself in practical avenues of social service. Jesus taught a living religion that impelled its believers to engage in the doing of loving service. <a id="s488_269"></a>[UB 170:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_8) 

> The righteousness of any act must be measured by the motive; the highest forms of good are therefore unconscious. Jesus was never concerned with morals or ethics as such. <a id="s490_173"></a>[UB 170:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_9) 

> ... man develops his character by unselfish service; that he unfolds his moral nature in loving relations with his fellows. <a id="s492_126"></a>[UB 170:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_10) 

As we take each day as it comes, we are presented with opportunities to serve, to be good, to be reflective. ‘As Jesus passed by’, he lived in the moment. He was always mindful of people and their circumstances.

> Jesus spread good cheer everywhere he went. He was full of grace and truth. His associates never ceased to wonder at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. You can cultivate gracefulness, but graciousness is the aroma of friendliness which emanates from a love-saturated soul. <a id="s496_292"></a>[UB 171:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_1) 

> And it behooves the Master's followers in all ages to learn to minister as “they pass by” to do unselfish good as they go about their daily duties. <a id="s498_150"></a>[UB 171:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_10)

The spiritual calling is not for the faint-hearted. Just when we think we have taken a big step, the bar gets set higher and higher. Our donations to genuinely worthy causes may not amount to much in relative terms. So how much would you have to contribute to match this poor widow?

> For a moment they sat down by the treasury, watching the people drop in their contributions: the rich putting much in the receiving box and all giving something in accordance with the extent of their possessions. At last there came along a poor widow, scantily attired, and they observed as she cast two mites (small coppers) into the trumpet. And then said Jesus, calling the attention of the apostles to the widow: _“Heed well what you have just seen. This poor widow cast in more than all the others, for all these others, from their superfluity, cast in some trifle as a gift, but this poor woman, even though she is in want, gave all that she had, even her living.”_ <a id="s507_674"></a>[UB 172:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p4_2) 

As they say in the TV news bulletins, if you are likely to feel offended at the reality of this, you better look away now. This very short story is loaded with action, fearlessness, principles, teachings, and a modicum of force. Maybe even the fulfillment of a scripture prophecy.

> In the midst of this noisy aggregation of moneychangers, merchandisers, and cattle sellers, Jesus, on this Monday morning, attempted to teach the gospel of the heavenly kingdom. He was not alone in resenting this profanation of the temple; the common people, especially the Jewish visitors from foreign provinces, also heartily resented this profiteering desecration of their national house of worship. At this time the Sanhedrin itself held its regular meetings in a chamber surrounded by all this babble and confusion of trade and barter. <a id="s511_543"></a>[UB 173:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p1_5) 

> To the amazement of his apostles, standing near at hand, who refrained from participation in what so soon followed, Jesus stepped down from the teaching platform and, going over to the lad who was driving the cattle through the court, took from him his whip of cords and swiftly drove the animals from the temple. But that was not all; he strode majestically before the wondering gaze of the thousands assembled in the temple court to the farthest cattle pen and proceeded to open the gates of every stall and to drive out the imprisoned animals. By this time the assembled pilgrims were electrified, and with uproarious shouting they moved toward the bazaars and began to overturn the tables of the money-changers. In less than five minutes all commerce had been swept from the temple. By the time the near-by Roman guards had appeared on the scene, all was quiet, and the crowds had become orderly; Jesus, returning to the speaker's stand, spoke to the multitude: _“You have this day witnessed that which is written in the Scriptures: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a den of robbers’.”_ <a id="s513_1142"></a>[UB 173:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p1_7) 

> This cleansing of the temple discloses the Master's attitude toward commercializing the practices of religion as well as his detestation of all forms of unfairness and profiteering at the expense of the poor and the unlearned. This episode also demonstrates that Jesus did not look with approval upon the refusal to employ force to protect the majority of any given human group against the unfair and enslaving practices of unjust minorities who may be able to entrench themselves behind political, financial, or ecclesiastical power. Shrewd, wicked, and designing men are not to be permitted to organize themselves for the exploitation and oppression of those who, because of their idealism, are not disposed to resort to force for self-protection or for the furtherance of their laudable life projects. <a id="s515_807"></a>[UB 173:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p1_11) 

Who is this person who continues to be so unfailingly wise? Some say he never existed. How then can the story of his life be explained? There has never been such a character even distantly comparable, even created by any of our great writers, since time began.

> Tuesday morning, when Jesus arrived in the temple court and began to teach, he had uttered but few words when a group of the younger students from the academies, who had been rehearsed for this purpose, came forward and by their spokesman addressed Jesus: “Master, we know you are a righteous teacher, and we know that you proclaim the ways of truth, and that you serve only God, for you fear no man, and that you are no respecter of persons. We are only students, and we would know the truth about a matter which troubles us; our difficulty is this: Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar? Shall we give or shall we not give?” Jesus, perceiving their hypocrisy and craftiness, said to them: _“Why do you thus come to tempt me? Show me the tribute money, and I will answer you.”_ And when they handed him a denarius, he looked at it and said, _“Whose image and superscription does this coin bear?”_ And when they answered him, “Caesar's,” Jesus said, _“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and render to God the things that are God's.”_ <a id="s519_1055"></a>[UB 174:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_2) 

> Both Pilate and Herod were in Jerusalem at this time, and Jesus' enemies conjectured that, if he would dare to advise against the payment of tribute to Caesar, they could go at once before the Roman authorities and charge him with sedition. On the other hand, if he should advise the payment of tribute in so many words, they rightly calculated that such a pronouncement would greatly wound the national pride of his Jewish hearers, thereby alienating the good will and affection of the multitude. <a id="s521_500"></a>[UB 174:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_4) 

> In all this the enemies of Jesus were defeated since it was a well-known ruling of the Sanhedrin, made for the guidance of the Jews dispersed among the gentile nations, that the “right of coinage carried with it the right to levy taxes.” In this manner Jesus avoided their trap. To have answered “No” to their question would have been equivalent to inciting rebellion; to have answered “Yes” would have shocked the deep-rooted nationalist sentiments of that day. The Master did not evade the question; he merely employed the wisdom of making a double reply. Jesus was never evasive, but he was always wise in his dealings with those who sought to harass and destroy him. <a id="s523_673"></a>[UB 174:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_5) 

Let each of us continue to labor at our workbench. The Son of Man may return in our lifetime. He probably won't. But then again, he just might.

> _“Each generation of believers should carry on their work, in view of the possible return of the Son of Man, exactly as each individual believer carries forward his lifework in view of inevitable and ever-impending natural death.”_ <a id="s527_234"></a>[UB 176:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_3) 

This is yet another reference to the importance of the material life needing to be directed and reflected in spiritual gains. Otherwise the return on your life investment will be zero. Is your inventory running low?

> In the next world you will be asked to give an account of the endowments and stewardships of this world. Whether inherent talents are few or many, a just and merciful reckoning must be faced. If endowments are used only in selfish pursuits and no thought is bestowed upon the higher duty of obtaining increased yield of the fruits of the spirit, as they are manifested in the ever-expanding service of men and the worship of God, such selfish stewards must accept the consequences of their deliberate choosing. <a id="s531_513"></a>[UB 176:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_8)

Here is another reference to the material-spiritual dichotomy. The mortal life affords us the opportunity to juxtapose them in a supreme way. Beware of rulers who claim false allegiance to God and man.

> And how dangerous ambition can become when it is once wholly wedded to self-seeking and supremely motivated by sullen and longsuppressed vengeance! What a crushing thing is disappointment in the lives of those foolish persons who, in fastening their gaze on the shadowy and evanescent allurements of time, become blinded to the higher and more real achievements of the everlasting attainments of the eternal worlds of divine values and true spiritual realities. <a id="s540_464"></a>[UB 177:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p4_10) 

> There is nothing incompatible between sonship in the spiritual kingdom and citizenship in the secular or civil government. It is the believer's duty to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to God the things which are God's. There cannot be any disagreement between these two requirements, the one being material and the other spiritual, unless it should develop that a Caesar presumes to usurp the prerogatives of God and demand that spiritual homage and supreme worship be rendered to him. In such a case you shall worship only God while you seek to enlighten such misguided earthly rulers and in this way lead them also to the recognition of the Father in heaven. You shall not render spiritual worship to earthly rulers; neither should you employ the physical forces of earthly governments, whose rulers may sometime become believers, in the work of furthering the mission of the spiritual kingdom. <a id="s542_918"></a>[UB 178:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_3) 

> Display wisdom and exhibit sagacity in your dealings with unbelieving civil rulers. By discretion show yourselves to be expert in ironing out minor disagreements and in adjusting trifling misunderstandings. In every possible way — in everything short of your spiritual allegiance to the rulers of the universe — seek to live peaceably with all men.

Do we find these benchmarks among those making the calls in this world? Can we say our leaders are illuminated? If they are a liability on our balance sheet, the mighty stimulus of good people must lead through loyalty and sincerity to achieve the divine cause.

> When a kingdom believer is called upon to serve the civil government, let him render such service as a temporal citizen of such a government, albeit such a believer should display in his civil service all of the ordinary traits of citizenship as these have been enhanced by the spiritual enlightenment of the ennobling association of the mind of mortal man with the indwelling spirit of the eternal God. If the unbeliever can qualify as a superior civil servant, you should seriously question whether the roots of truth in your heart have not died from the lack of the living waters of combined spiritual communion and social service. The consciousness of sonship with God should quicken the entire life service of every man, woman, and child who has become the possessor of such a mighty stimulus to all the inherent powers of a human personality. <a id="s548_851"></a>[UB 178:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_13) 

> Throughout the vicissitudes of life, remember always to love one another. Do not strive with men, even with unbelievers. Show mercy even to those who despitefully abuse you. Show yourselves to be loyal citizens, upright artisans, praiseworthy neighbors, devoted kinsmen, understanding parents, and sincere believers in the brotherhood of the Father's kingdom. And my spirit shall be upon you, now and even to the end of the world. <a id="s550_433"></a>[UB 178:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_17) 

The Golden Rule is a universal principle in just about all religions. It alone should have the power to be a unifier that generates spiritual goodwill across the planet. But it needs to be upheld with wisdom and discernment if it is to be truly empowering. Let's look at its ascending levels.

> The golden rule, when divested of the superhuman insight of the Spirit of Truth, becomes nothing more than a rule of high ethical conduct. The golden rule, when literally interpreted, may become the instrument of great offense to one's fellows. Without a spiritual discernment of the golden rule of wisdom you might reason that, since you are desirous that all men speak the full and frank truth of their minds to you, you should therefore fully and frankly speak the full thought of your mind to your fellow beings. Such an unspiritual interpretation of the golden rule might result in untold unhappiness and no end of sorrow. <a id="s554_630"></a>[UB 180:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_5) 

> Some persons discern and interpret the golden rule as a purely intellectual affirmation of human fraternity. Others experience this expression of human relationship as an emotional gratification of the tender feelings of the human personality. Another mortal recognizes this same golden rule as the yardstick for measuring all social relations, the standard of social conduct. Still others look upon it as being the positive injunction of a great moral teacher who embodied in this statement the highest concept of moral obligation as regards all fraternal relationships. In the lives of such moral beings the golden rule becomes the wise center and circumference of all their philosophy. <a id="s556_691"></a>[UB 180:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_6) 

> In the kingdom of the believing brotherhood of Godknowing truth lovers, this golden rule takes on living qualities of spiritual realization on those higher levels of interpretation which cause the mortal sons of God to view this injunction of the Master as requiring them so to relate themselves to their fellows that they will receive the highest possible good as a result of the believer's contact with them. This is the essence of true religion: that you love your neighbor as yourself. <a id="s558_492"></a>[UB 180:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_7) 

> But the highest realization and the truest interpretation of the golden rule consists in the consciousness of the spirit of the truth of the enduring and living reality of such a divine declaration. <a id="s560_201"></a>[UB 180:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_8) 

It is because the organization is such an icon of our material world that it is appropriate to demand its nature and identity embrace a spiritual component. It is accountable to its shareholders. And in the quest of planetary survival, we are all shareholders.

> Jesus gives peace to his fellow doers of the will of God but not on the order of the joys and satisfactions of this material world. Unbelieving materialists and fatalists can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and soul comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and to endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes. <a id="s564_494"></a>[UB 181:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p1_7) 

> A certain amount of both stoicism and optimism are serviceable in living a life on earth, but neither has aught to do with that superb peace which the Son of God bestows upon his brethren in the flesh. The peace which Michael gives his children on earth is that very peace which filled his own soul when he himself lived the mortal life in the flesh and on this very world. The peace of Jesus is the joy and satisfaction of a Godknowing individual who has achieved the triumph of learning fully how to do the will of God while living the mortal life in the flesh. <a id="s566_566"></a>[UB 181:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p1_8)

Sometimes what seems the moment of greatest defeat may in fact be one of our greatest victories when seen within the context of an ongoing life, and the challenges of its eternal adventures.

> Jesus' heart was being crushed; he truly loved his brethren. He was isolated from his family in the flesh; one of his chosen associates was betraying him. His father Joseph's people had rejected him and thereby sealed their doom as a people with a special mission on earth. His soul was tortured by baffled love and rejected mercy. It was just one of those awful human moments when everything seems to bear down with crushing cruelty and terrible agony. <a id="s575_456"></a>[UB 182:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_9) 

> What is this trait of the animal in man which leads him to want to insult and physically assault that which he cannot spiritually attain or intellectually achieve? In the half-civilized man there still lurks an evil brutality which seeks to vent itself upon those who are superior in wisdom and spiritual attainment. <a id="s577_319"></a>[UB 184:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p4_5) 

Giving the customer a rewarding experience is not a Mission Statement. This is a Mission Statement.

> _“Devote your life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world... Love is the ancestor of all spiritual goodness, the essence of the true and the beautiful.”_ <a id="s581_173"></a>[UB 192:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_1) 

> _“Serve your fellow men even as I have served you; forgive your fellow mortals even as I have forgiven you. Let experience teach you the value of meditation and the power of intelligent reflection.”_ <a id="s583_202"></a>[UB 192:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_2) 

> _“Never forget that, when you are a faith son of God, all upright work of the realm is sacred. Nothing which a son of God does can be common. Do your work, therefore, from this time on, as for God. And when you are through on this world, I have other and better worlds where you shall likewise work for me. And in all of this work, on this world and on other worlds, I will work with you, and my spirit shall dwell within you.”_ <a id="s585_431"></a>[UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13) 

These quotes are included for their universal value rather than a singular corporate relevance. In addition, they are a fitting part of the unified and consistent message of the book.

> Many things which happen in the course of a human life are hard to understand, difficult to reconcile with the idea that this is a universe in which truth prevails and in which righteousness triumphs. It so often appears that slander, lies, dishonesty, and unrighteousness — sin — prevail. Does faith, after all, triumph over evil, sin, and iniquity? It does. And the life and death of Jesus are the eternal proof that the truth of goodness and the faith of the spiritled creature will always be vindicated. <a id="s589_510"></a>[UB 194:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_2) 

> To Jesus, mortal life had dealt its hardest, cruelest, and bitterest blows; and this man met these ministrations of despair with faith, courage, and the unswerving determination to do his Father's will. Jesus met life in all its terrible reality and mastered — it even in death. <a id="s591_281"></a>[UB 194:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_3) 

> The spiritual forward urge is the most powerful driving force present in this world; the truth-learning believer is the one progressive and aggressive soul on earth. <a id="s593_168"></a>[UB 194:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_4) 

> The secret of a better civilization is bound up in the Master's teachings of the brotherhood of man, the good will of love and mutual trust. <a id="s595_143"></a>[UB 194:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_12) 

> The religion of Jesus is the most powerful unifying influence the world has ever known. <a id="s597_90"></a>[UB 194:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_17) 

> Pentecost was designed to lessen the selfassertiveness of individuals, groups, nations, and races. It is this spirit of self-assertiveness which so increases in tension that it periodically breaks loose in destructive wars. Mankind can be unified only by the spiritual approach, and the Spirit of Truth is a world influence which is universal. <a id="s599_346"></a>[UB 194:3.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_18) 

> The joy of this outpoured spirit, when it is consciously experienced in human life, is a tonic for health, a stimulus for mind, and an unfailing energy for the soul. <a id="s601_168"></a>[UB 194:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_19) 

Whose side are you on?

> Religion is now confronted by the challenge of a new age of scientific minds and materialistic tendencies. In this gigantic struggle between the secular and the spiritual, the religion of Jesus will eventually triumph. <a id="s605_221"></a>[UB 195:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_5) 

Just to be clear, the individual and personal spiritual experience of true religion is different to other elevated, though limited, forms of behavior that might be deemed most honorable in an individual and corporate sense.

> Religion is the revelation to man of his divine and eternal destiny. Religion is a purely personal and spiritual experience and must forever be distinguished from man's other high forms of thought, such as: <a id="s609_209"></a>[UB 195:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_3) 
> 
> 1. Man's logical attitude toward the things of material reality.
> 2. Man's aesthetic appreciation of beauty contrasted with ugliness.
> 3. Man's ethical recognition of social obligations and political duty.
> 4. Even man's sense of human morality is not, in and of itself, religious.

Just as we can become financially bankrupt, we can become morally bankrupt. Materialism provides us with things, not always essential, and we always seem to be running out of them. By meditating on the various sources of supply, we find the romantic and spontaneous option.

> Scientists have unintentionally precipitated mankind into a materialistic panic; they have started an unthinking run on the moral bank of the ages, but this bank of human experience has vast spiritual resources; it can stand the demands being made upon it. Only unthinking men become panicky about the spiritual assets of the human race. When the materialistic-secular panic is over, the religion of Jesus will not be found bankrupt. The spiritual bank of the kingdom of heaven will be paying out faith, hope, and moral security to all who draw upon it “in His name.” <a id="s618_570"></a>[UB 195:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_1) 

> The mechanistic naturalism of some supposedly educated men and the thoughtless secularism of the man in the street are both exclusively concerned with _things_; they are barren of all real values, sanctions, and satisfactions of a spiritual nature, as well as being devoid of faith, hope, and eternal assurances. One of the great troubles with modern life is that man thinks he is too busy to find time for spiritual meditation and religious devotion. <a id="s620_454"></a>[UB 195:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_7) 

> Materialism reduces man to a soulless automaton and constitutes him merely an arithmetical symbol finding a helpless place in the mathematical formula of an unromantic and mechanistic universe. But whence comes all this vast universe of mathematics without a Master Mathematician? <a id="s622_283"></a>[UB 195:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_8) 

> The finite universe of matter would eventually become uniform and deterministic but for the combined presence of mind and spirit. The influence of the cosmic mind constantly injects spontaneity into even the material worlds. <a id="s624_227"></a>[UB 195:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_15)

Because of its methods of measurement and evaluation, science is not able to discover or disprove a spiritual storehouse, and that's a fact.

> How foolish it is for material-minded man to allow such vulnerable theories as those of a mechanistic universe to deprive him of the vast spiritual resources of the personal experience of true religion. Facts never quarrel with real spiritual faith; theories may. Better that science should be devoted to the destruction of superstition rather than attempting the overthrow of religious faith — human belief in spiritual realities and divine values. <a id="s633_452"></a>[UB 195:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_1) 

> Science should do for man materially what religion does for him spiritually: extend the horizon of life and enlarge his personality. True science can have no lasting quarrel with true religion. The “scientific method” is merely an intellectual yardstick wherewith to measure material adventures and physical achievements. But being material and wholly intellectual, it is utterly useless in the evaluation of spiritual realities and religious experiences. <a id="s635_458"></a>[UB 195:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_2) 

The arts showcase the creative efforts of individuals. The originator needs to be recognized for otherwise the art would not have been fashioned. It transcends the material from which it was wrought. It enters another realm of evaluation and appreciation, similar perhaps to the level that inspired it.

> Art proves that man is not mechanistic, but it does not prove that he is spiritually immortal. Art is mortal morontia, the intervening field between man, the material, and man, the spiritual. <a id="s639_194"></a>[UB 195:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_15) 

Poetry is an effort to escape from material realities to spiritual values.

> In a high civilization, art humanizes science, while in turn it is spiritualized by true religion — insight into spiritual and eternal values. Art represents the human and time-space evaluation of reality. Religion is the divine embrace of cosmic values and connotes eternal progression in spiritual ascension and expansion. The art of time is dangerous only when it becomes blind to the spirit standards of the divine patterns which eternity reflects as the reality shadows of time. True art is the effective manipulation of the material things of life; religion is the ennobling transformation of the material facts of life, and it never ceases in its spiritual evaluation of art. <a id="s643_685"></a>[UB 195:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_16) 

The universe of universes is testament to a might creative act. The Creator is the individual to be recognized.

> Any scientific interpretation of the material universe is valueless unless it provides due recognition for the _scientist_. No appreciation of art is genuine unless it accords recognition to the _artist_. No evaluation of morals is worth while unless it includes the _moralist_. No recognition of philosophy is edifying if it ignores the _philosopher_, and religion cannot exist without the real experience of the _religionist_ who, in and through this very experience, is seeking to find God and to know him. <a id="s647_512"></a>[UB 195:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_18) 

> The universe is not like the laws, mechanisms, and the uniformities which the scientist discovers, and which he comes to regard as science, but rather like the curious, thinking, choosing, creative, combining, and discriminating _scientist_ who thus observes universe phenomena and classifies the mathematical facts inherent in the mechanistic phases of the material side of creation. Neither is the universe like the art of the artist, but rather like the striving, dreaming, aspiring, and advancing _artist_ who seeks to transcend the world of material things in an effort to achieve a spiritual goal. <a id="s649_606"></a>[UB 195:7.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_22) 

Here is an essay on secular totalitarianism. This now seems to be the unthinking default position of acceptance, because this is the way of the world. It is always a big challenge to find a way to upgrade a status quo.

> But even after materialism and mechanism have been more or less vanquished, the devastating influence of twentiethcentury secularism will still blight the spiritual experience of millions of unsuspecting souls. <a id="s653_213"></a>[UB 195:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_1) 

> It required a great power, a mighty influence, to free the thinking and living of the Western peoples from the withering grasp of a totalitarian ecclesiastical domination. Secularism did break the bonds of church control, and now in turn it threatens to establish a new and godless type of mastery over the hearts and minds of modern man. The tyrannical and dictatorial political state is the direct offspring of scientific materialism and philosophic secularism. Secularism no sooner frees man from the domination of the institutionalized church than it sells him into slavish bondage to the totalitarian state. Secularism frees man from ecclesiastical slavery only to betray him into the tyranny of political and economic slavery. <a id="s655_735"></a>[UB 195:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_4) 

> But beware! this godless philosophy of human society will lead only to unrest, animosity, unhappiness, war, and world-wide disaster. <a id="s657_135"></a>[UB 195:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_5)

But modern secularism, while appearances may be to the contrary, is not winning over the true and basic aspirations of mankind. The only way to extend its lifecycle is to add a preservative, a stabilizing essence. Materialistic achievement, while amazing, is incapable of sustaining itself, and needs spirit energy to regenerate.

> It is not necessary to sacrifice faith in God in order to enjoy the blessings of the modern secularistic revolt: tolerance, social service, democratic government, and civil liberties. It was not necessary for the secularists to antagonize true religion in order to promote science and to advance education. <a id="s666_309"></a>[UB 195:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_8) 

> But secularism is not the sole parent of all these recent gains in the enlargement of living. Behind the gains of the twentieth century are not only science and secularism but also the unrecognized and unacknowledged spiritual workings of the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. <a id="s668_285"></a>[UB 195:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_9) 

> Without God, without religion, scientific secularism can never co-ordinate its forces, harmonize its divergent and rivalrous interests, races, and nationalisms. This secularistic human society, notwithstanding its unparalleled materialistic achievement, is slowly disintegrating. The chief cohesive force resisting this disintegration of antagonism is nationalism. And nationalism is the chief barrier to world peace. <a id="s670_420"></a>[UB 195:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_10) 

> The inherent weakness of secularism is that it discards ethics and religion for politics and power. You simply cannot establish the brotherhood of men while ignoring or denying the fatherhood of God. <a id="s672_202"></a>[UB 195:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_11) 

> Secular social and political optimism is an illusion. Without God, neither freedom and liberty, nor property and wealth will lead to peace. <a id="s674_142"></a>[UB 195:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_12) 

The pursuit of money and power can be a corrupting influence on all of the religions of the world, not just Christianity. In addition, the fixed traditions of beliefs prevent them being reinvigorated with expanding truths. Change.

> Christianity has dared to lower its ideals before the challenge of human greed, warmadness, and the lust for power ... <a id="s678_121"></a>[UB 195:9.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_9) 

> Christianity is threatened by slow death from formalism, overorganization, intellectualism, and other nonspiritual trends. The modern Christian church is not such a brotherhood of dynamic believers as Jesus commissioned continuously to effect the spiritual transformation of successive generations of mankind. <a id="s680_312"></a>[UB 195:9.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_10) 

> So-called Christianity has become a social and cultural movement as well as a religious belief and practice. <a id="s682_111"></a>[UB 195:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_11) 

> But there is no excuse for the involvement of the church in commerce and politics; such unholy alliances are a flagrant betrayal of the Master. And the genuine lovers of truth will be slow to forget that this powerful institutionalized church has often dared to smother newborn faith and persecute truth bearers who chanced to appear in unorthodox raiment. <a id="s684_359"></a>[UB 195:10.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_13) 

Education equips us for the specialist skills we need for the competitive selection and promotion systems of the corporate life. But it has not developed a training and loyalty program for the supreme purposes of living.

> Even secular education could help in this great spiritual renaissance if it would pay more attention to the work of teaching youth how to engage in life planning and character progression. The purpose of all education should be to foster and further the supreme purpose of life, the development of a majestic and well-balanced personality. There is great need for the teaching of moral discipline in the place of so much self-gratification. Upon such a foundation religion may contribute its spiritual incentive to the enlargement and enrichment of mortal life, even to the security and enhancement of life eternal. <a id="s688_618"></a>[UB 195:10.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_17) 

The corporatization of the church, the mosque, the synagogue, and other temples, leaves us bereft, for they are neglecting their only true role. And that is to embody and tell all the glorious truths of the true prophets, and in particular, the revelations of Jesus of Nazareth, who spoke the greatest truths that mankind can ever hear. We are to be eternally grateful to the revelators and all associates who arranged for the magnificent gift now available to us.

> Christianity suffers under a great handicap because it has become identified in the minds of all the world as a part of the social system, the industrial life, and the moral standards of Western civilization; and thus has Christianity unwittingly seemed to sponsor a society which staggers under the guilt of tolerating science without idealism, politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without restraint, knowledge without character, power without conscience, and industry without morality. <a id="s692_512"></a>[UB 195:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_20) 

> The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear — the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. <a id="s694_366"></a>[UB 195:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21) 

Business, exchange, and interdependency, reign supreme as they represent economic necessity. But they are only one aspect of living and need to be integrated into all other human natures, commitments, and loyalties.

> Personal faith, spiritual hope, and moral devotion were always correlated in a matchless religious unity of harmonious association with the keen realization of the reality and sacredness of all human loyalties personal honor, family love, religious obligation, social duty, and economic necessity. <a id="s698_300"></a>[UB 196:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_7) 

Business offers a low level of mediocre success. The Urantia business model transcends the purely material, and demands that the truly successful business is a reflection of successful living based on, integrating, and balancing, the all encompassing teachings of Jesus.

> Some men's lives are too great and noble to descend to the low level of being merely successful. The animal must adapt itself to the environment, but the religious man transcends his environment and in this way escapes the limitations of the present material world through this insight of divine love. This concept of love generates in the soul of man that superanimal effort to find truth, beauty, and goodness; and when he does find them, he is glorified in their embrace; he is consumed with the desire to live them, to do righteousness. <a id="s702_543"></a>[UB 196:3.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_32) 

> LIFE IS BUT A DAY'S WORK — DO IT WELL.  <a id="s704_42"></a>[UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13)
