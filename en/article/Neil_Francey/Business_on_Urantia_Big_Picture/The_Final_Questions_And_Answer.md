## THE FINAL QUESTIONS

WHO HAVE YOU APPOINTED AS YOUR AUDITOR?

ARE YOU READY TO FACE YOUR EXAMINER?

WHO IS THE CUSTODIAN OF YOUR WILL?

ARE YOU READY TO FACE YOUR JUDGE AND JURY?

HAVE YOU DEMONSTRATED THE MERCY YOU WILL EXPECT?

WILL YOU BE PROUD OF THE VIDEO RÉSUMÉ OF YOUR LIFE?

DO YOU EAGERLY AWAIT YOUR ASCENSION CAREER?

HAVE YOU REALLY STRIVED TO DO THE WILL OF GOD?

HAVE YOU COOPERATED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT WITH YOUR DIVINE INDWELLING SPIRIT?

WILL YOUR INDWELLING SPIRIT PROUDLY SUBMIT THE ENDEAVORS OF YOUR LIFE TO THE TRIBUNALS OF THE ANCIENTS OF DAYS?

## AND ANSWER

Consider this message that was transmitted by a divine indwelling spirit to their human associate:

> _Among other things, the Adjuster pleaded ‘that he more faithfully give me his sincere co-operation, more cheerfully endure the tasks of my emplacement, more faithfully carry out the program of my arrangement, more patiently go through the trials of my selection, more persistently and cheerfully tread the path of my choosing, more humbly receive credit that may accrue as a result of my ceaseless endeavors - thus transmit my admonition to the man of my indwelling. Upon him I bestow the supreme devotion and affection of a divine spirit. And say further to my beloved subject that I will function with wisdom and power until the very end, until the last earth struggle is over; I will be true to my personality trust. And I exhort him to survival, not to disappoint me, not to deprive me of the reward of my patient and intense struggle. On the human will our achievement of personality depends. Circle by circle I have patiently ascended this human mind, and I have testimony that I am meeting the approval of the chief of my kind. Circle by circle I am passing on to judgment. I await with pleasure and without apprehension the roll call of destiny; I am prepared to submit all to the tribunals of the Ancients of Days.’_ [UB 110:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_10)
