## The Fourth and Fifth at Sixes and Sevens

This section considers the two recent revelations that are about Jesus. The fourth and fifth revelations have much in common regarding the prevailing challenges and reactions, and even the misunderstanding among followers.

## The Teachings of the Fourth Were Rejected

The new teachings of Jesus were certain to be in conflict with the religionists of the day. Jesus was killed as a direct result.

Admittedly, Jesus was saying things about who he was, where he was from, and the reason for his message. This was difficult for people then, as it is for many now, to grasp. He knew what he had to convey, not just for Urantia but for the local universe of Nebadon, and this somewhat accounted for the context and the scope of his teaching.

## Compromises Were Tried

Many efforts were made for acceptability. For example, Jesus tried to accommodate their beliefs with his teaching about the Kingdom of God which led to some degree of confusion among his followers. _Much of the early persecution of Christians in Rome was due solely to their unfortunate use of the term “kingdom” in their preaching._ (<a id="s48_335"></a>[UB 195:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_2))

Then along came Paul who watered down the teachings to win the approval of the Jews and of course all that has been a disaster. _Though these efforts failed as far as winning the Jews was concerned, they did not fail to confuse and alienate many honest souls in all subsequent generations._ (<a id="s50_292"></a>[UB 149:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_3)) And for good measure Paul also adapted it to suit the Greco-Roman mind set.

Then there was the biggest calamity: _And so, under the vigorous leadership of Peter and ere the Master ascended to the Father, his well-meaning representatives began that subtle process of gradually and certainly changing the religion <ins>of</ins> Jesus into a new and modified form of religion <ins>about</ins> Jesus._ (<a id="s52_323"></a>[UB 192:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p4_8))

> _This overemphasis of the personality of Jesus in the theology of Christianity has worked to obscure his teachings, and all of this has made it increasingly difficult for Jews, Mohammedans, Hindus, and other Eastern religionists to accept the teachings of Jesus._ (<a id="s54_267"></a>[UB 149:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_4))

## Are We Better Placed To Accept The Fifth?

Jesus' task may have been simpler if his listeners had a more appropriate spiritual perspective. Fortunately for us, the background spirit perspective provided by Parts 1 - 3 of _The Urantia Book_, give us that framework. So the biography regarding the Fourth revelation, in Part 4 of the Book, can be readily accommodated into the human mind. At last we can relate to the real person and the real story, with real places and recorded historical events.

However _The Urantia Book_, as it brings the same message of the personal religion of the spirit, will be at odds with today's religionists who once again will be greatly offended at being told the errors of their beliefs, if they retain their religions of the mind rather than a religion of the spirit.

## Compromises Are Being Attempted

By applying this background to today, what do we get? Will _The Urantia Book_ be watered down to appeal to prevailing interest groups as Jesus teachings were 2,000 years ago? Will it be cherry picked for populism? Is it at risk of being demonized by vested interests of the religion industry?

Will people who would condemn the maladaptation by Paul, Peter, and James (in the main), in turn do exactly the same damage to the Book which is endeavoring to correct the record and highlight previous errors?

## History Is Repeating

_The Urantia Book_ is not the word of God. That would be a relic of the olden tendency to ascribe everything to do with natural phenomena, spiritual thought, and religious writings, as coming from God himself.

This development could be compared with the way Christianity has promoted the Bible as ‘The Word of God’. This has resulted in the Bible becoming a ‘fetish’ and resulting in intelligent men and women believing all manner of absurd things, and justifying many evil acts,

It would be preferable and more accurate to say the Book is a revelation about God, the universe, universe personalities, various orders of celestial beings, the history of Urantia, and so on. It offers a pathway to finding God.

> _... the revelation of God must always be partial, relative, and progressive until his power becomes experientially infinite in the space potency of the Unqualified Absolute ..._ (<a id="s76_182"></a>[UB 56:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p9_7))

> _You can know God, not by understanding what Jesus said, but by knowing what Jesus was. Jesus <ins>was</ins> a revelation of God._ (<a id="s78_134"></a>[UB 169:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p4_4))

## The Custodians Of The Fourth

> _Jesus saw a group of the Sadducees and Pharisees making their way through the crowd, and he paused for a moment until they drew near him, when he said: “You know how your fathers rejected the prophets, and you well know that you are set in your hearts to reject the Son of Man.” And then, looking with searching gaze upon those priests and elders who were standing near him, Jesus said: “Did you never read in the Scripture about the stone which the builders rejected, and which, when the people had discovered it, was made into the cornerstone? And so once more do I warn you that, if you continue to reject this gospel, presently will the kingdom of God be taken away from you and be given to a people willing to receive the good news and to bring forth the fruits of the spirit.”_ (<a id="s82_788"></a>[UB 173:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p4_4))

> _When the Pharisees heard these words, they understood that Jesus referred to themselves and the other Jewish leaders._ (<a id="s84_123"></a>[UB 173:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p4_5))

There should be hundreds of questions that intrigue, such as:

Who became the custodians of the partial teachings of Jesus?

Who took its main influence to Rome after 70 AD?

How and when did Christianity progressively originate?

What happened to the followers of the true gospel of Jesus?

Who wrote and who compiled the New Testament?

The real answers can be found, although often they will conflict with the answers commonly given by those who rewrite history.

The truth about such questions will give a better insight into the Christian religion throughout the centuries, and its role today. Notwithstanding its trials and tribulations, it still contains the seeds of the truths presented by Jesus, and it remains a beacon of hope for a brighter future for all mankind.

Perhaps we can be comforted by this:

> _Christianity exhibits a history of having originated out of the unintended transformation of the religion of Jesus into a religion about Jesus. It further presents the history of having experienced Hellenization, paganization, secularization, institutionalization, intellectual deterioration, spiritual decadence, moral hibernation, threatened extinction, later rejuvenation, fragmentation, and more recent relative rehabilitation. Such a pedigree is indicative of inherent vitality and the possession of vast recuperative resources. And this same Christianity is now present in the civilized world of Occidental peoples and stands face to face with a struggle for existence which is even more ominous than those eventful crises which have characterized its past battles for dominance._ (<a id="s104_791"></a>[UB 195:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_4))

The Urantia Papers have such recuperative powers. Their truths can win the struggle for existence that they in turn will face. At least they are here on the planet, and they are currently available for anyone to access and read.

## Where To From Here?

_The Urantia Book_ has entered a complex world. Already many religions and ideologies are aware of it. Some groups are trying to build organizations around the revelation. Many are claiming authenticity in the name of the Book for their distorted interpretations of the revelatory concepts.

Some don't seem to appreciate the scope of the information and say the Book needs additional content. Sadly, some are claiming to be receiving such from superhuman sources.

We need to do everything possible to preserve the supreme potential of this great gift from Michael, and avoid mistakes made in the past. This means mindfully following the Spirit of Truth and valiantly resisting those modern-day revisionists who would claim bestowed knowledge and authority. Revelation has set a new stage for the long and arduous evolutionary struggle.

The waiting celestial intelligences of the on-looking universes could well be asking: Will the revelation contained in The Urantia Book, be given the chance to touch the hearts and minds of all people and thereby uplift the entire world? Will it be recognized as a revelation?

Or will the revelation be prevented from doing so by the default of a country, race, organization, or human group, that abrogates responsibility or invokes the revelation's inherent strength for their own agenda?

Again will Jesus' words about the cornerstone ring true: “ _... on whomsoever this stone falls, he will be ground to dust and his ashes scattered to the four winds._” (<a id="s120_168"></a>[UB 173:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p4_4))

Will there be the unintended (or intended) transformation of the revelation into an industry about the revelation?

## Maintaining Access To The Revelation

Consider losing our freedom of speech, association, movement, and worship. And the banning or destruction of books. There are signs of all these things.

And there are such historical events:

> _The Dalamatia library, destroyed soon after the Caligastia disaffection, comprised more than two million separate records and was known as the ‘house of Fad’._ (<a id="s130_164"></a>[UB 66:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_9))

> _The last of these few altered and amended copies [by Andrew] was destroyed by fire at Alexandria about one hundred years after the original was written by the first chosen of the twelve apostles._ (<a id="s132_201"></a>[UB 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9))

Quite simply, the Book must remain freely and openly available. Otherwise the responsibility for publication and dissemination in English would become a private matter for those readers who believe in the Book and who have the necessary resources. The English version is in the public domain.

Translations of the Book would become an issue. Most of them are currently subject to copyright held by the Urantia Foundation, and the others by a Urantia Society. If publication of these translations is discontinued, Book readers in various countries might have to make arrangements for personal use of the Book to be available through private funding.

If the Book itself for any reason was not available to the people of the world, the revelation may technically be in default. There is comfort in the thought that the Book will always be available, as it is accessible on the Internet. But even the Internet can block access to information.

And we are finding that social media can be manipulated. And yes, Artificial Intelligence has access to _The Urantia Book_, and can comment on it and precis it.

All of the brilliant work by students over the years is contained on the main Urantia sites on the Internet. The extent of scholarly analysis, the detailed listing of terms, the informed discussion, provides information for centuries to come. Hopefully, this is even now preserved. But some is already lost.

If we think the small groups of followers are important now, think how much more important the small but loyal groups of people are going to be when the wider public mission of the revelation begins.

The revelation will be subjected to an increase in genuine scrutiny one day. This will be a welcome circumstance. And let's hope there is an extensive and discerning readership at that stage.

But opposing forces will still use the information to say they are working for the good of all, and talk about the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. People can be given partial and inverted truths to divert them from the full truth.

Readers may be called conspiracy theorists as a means to discredit them. Such methods are already in use generally, and people can be hired to lie and mislead even on major issues.

That is not difficult to do. It is happening in regard to many events. How people will claim to be qualified as an authority on the Book will be an interesting issue.

It seems this world is not being run for the overall benefit of humanity, but by self-interest as if it were a business, and the planet itself a realm owned and controlled by those self-appointed authorities.

Expect the Book to continue its slow and unspectacular journey. Currently its public exposure has been limited, and in one sense it is perhaps being kept safe by such a low profile. However, we can be sure it is already being monitored by government as are all such organizations, but no doubt its impact is considered nonthreatening at this stage.

This will all change when the revelation gains acceptance to a level deemed worrisome by opposing forces. The Most Highs rule here on earth and they will be exerting certain controls over the destiny of the revelation, while not compromising human will.

## What Can Each Of Us Do In Our Lifetime?

> _You who have professed entrance into the kingdom of heaven are altogether too vacillating and indefinite in your teaching conduct. The heathen strike directly for their objectives; you are guilty of too much chronic yearning. If you desire to enter the kingdom, why do you not take it by spiritual assault even as the heathen take a city they lay siege to? You are hardly worthy of the kingdom when your service consists so largely in an attitude of regretting the past, whining over the present, and vainly hoping for the future._ (<a id="s162_536"></a>[UB 155:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_3))

## Three Powerful Little Stories

There are simple ways to contemplate our concerns about the future of the fifth revelation of epochal significance.

**Story 1**

> _From Edentia up through Salvington and even on to Uversa, for seven long years the first inquiry of all subordinate celestial life regarding the Satania rebellion, ever and always, was: “What of Amadon of Urantia, does he still stand unmoved?”_ (<a id="s170_249"></a>[UB 67:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p8_3))

> _If the Lucifer rebellion has handicapped the local system and its fallen worlds, if the loss of this Son and his misled associates has temporarily hampered the progress of the constellation of Norlatiadek, then weigh the effect of the farflung presentation of the inspiring performance of this one child of nature and his determined band of 143 comrades in standing steadfast for the higher concepts of universe management and administration in the face of such tremendous and adverse pressure exerted by his disloyal superiors. And let me assure you, this has already done more good in the universe of Nebadon and the superuniverse of Orvonton than can ever be outweighed by the sum total of all the evil and sorrow of the Lucifer rebellion._ (<a id="s172_748"></a>[UB 67:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p8_4))

**Story 2**

> _This Jesus sect was growing rapidly, and once more the Sadducees took notice of them. The Pharisees were little bothered about the situation, seeing that none of the teachings in any way interfered with the observance of the Jewish laws. But the Sadducees began to put the leaders of the Jesus sect in jail until they were prevailed upon to accept the counsel of one of the leading rabbis, Gamaliel, who advised them: “Refrain from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest haply you be found even to be fighting against God.” They decided to follow Gamaliel's counsel, and there ensued a time of peace and quiet in Jerusalem, during which the new gospel about Jesus spread rapidly._ (<a id="s176_809"></a>[UB 194:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_10))

**Story 3**

> _John said to Jesus: “Master, yesterday I went over to Ashtaroth to see a man who was teaching in your name and even claiming to be able to cast out devils. Now this fellow had never been with us, neither does he follow after us; therefore I forbade him to do such things.” Then said Jesus: “Forbid him not. Do you not perceive that this gospel of the kingdom shall presently be proclaimed in all the world? How can you expect that all who will believe the gospel shall be subject to your direction? Rejoice that already our teaching has begun to manifest itself beyond the bounds of our personal influence. Do you not see, John, that those who profess to do great works in my name must eventually support our cause?”_ (<a id="s180_722"></a>[UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1))

We can apply the same reasoning to the fifth when we see it facing issues of ownership, control, misrepresentation, availability, and progress.

Let us trust a time will come when there will no longer be the need for the world be at sixes and sevens with these two extraordinary revelations.

## A Summary of the Past, Present, and Future

_The Urantia Book_ contains a long and brilliant essay that directly assesses our current predicament. It is the revelators intentional warning to us. The further we look back, the better we can visualize the future.

This essay is Paper 195.

Although it was written almost one hundred years ago, it seems to have been specifically written for these days of the 21^st^ century. It takes us on a journey from the time of Pentecost to the influences upon the teachings of Jesus in the first few centuries after the Master's death.

Then it mentions the European Dark Ages, and then specifically concentrates on the modern problem concerning the dangers of materialism and secularism.

And, as uncomfortable as it may be for many religionists, it addresses the problems that still face Christianity to this day.

Truly, could we ask for a better summary, a more concerned voice of authority. But will mankind realize we are being admonished by wise and concerned celestial personalities? Or are these guidelines to be ignored?

And the final section is about the future. The revelators have identified the issues for us. If we are still unable to recognize the circumstances we face, then humanity will have to recover from that eventual lower stage when we do realize our predicament.

In this section on the future, attention is given to the potential role of a revitalized Christianity. Can that be achieved in some way? Can The Urantia Book be a contributor in that regard?

Just as the fourth revelation could not be stopped over the centuries, so will it be with the fifth? The personal involvement of a Creator Son on this planet, and the powerful spiritual influences that stream into inhabited planets, ensure an eventual time of enlightenment even on this troubled sphere.

No matter who tries to subvert or diminish the influence, it will not succeed. Man's meager efforts are no match for the power of spirit which is always engulfing the planet, at universal and personal levels.

The remnants of Jesus' teaching contained within Christianity, and the mighty revelatory record contained in the fifth, are a part of God.

We are to forge ahead in faith. We are slowly advancing with our higher associates, but real progress seems to be taking more than just a little time.

## The Day Will Come

Jesus gave the highest representation of God ever known to man.

And based solely upon his teachings and the information in The Urantia Book, the following marvelous presentation called The Future has been written from a human viewpoint by a Book reader of many years. This beautiful picture is a summary of God's plan for mankind.

God's love ensures this magnificent future will be achieved, even from our current predicament. In his wisdom, he is allowing us to discover his truth experientially, assisted by the divine guidance of revelation. And the truth we are experiencing is indeed our ascension career to Paradise.
