## The Distant Past

Consider what might have been involved to navigate this revelation safely to mankind, after recognizing the need and instigating action.

Publication of the Urantia revelation occurred in 1955. But what transpired prior to that? When did the planning commence? We might estimate the lead time based on many ideas:

- From documented contact over 100 years ago in Chicago.
- To a claimed reference to The Middle Ages by one of the revelators.
- To a possible indication 2,000 years ago by Jesus. (<a id="s40_54"></a>[UB 132:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p6_3))
- Upon the default of Adam and Eve and references in the Papers to a comment made some 40,000 years ago to Adam. (<a id="s41_114"></a>[UB 119:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p7_2)) There is also a reference at <a id="s41_188"></a>[UB 43:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p1_6).
- Upon the planet being placed in spiritual quarantine at the time of the Lucifer rebellion some 200,000 years ago.
- A reference to our history commencing a billion years ago when Michael assumed sovereignty of his local universe.
- Four hundred billion years ago when Michael started organizing this local universe. (<a id="s44_87"></a>[UB 57:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_7))
- And to God the Father who probably knew details eons prior to that, perhaps at the moment of the creation of the seven superuniverses.


## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INITIAL CONTACT

The introduction of revelatory proceedings to planetary mortals commenced early in the twentieth century:

- <ins>1906-1922</ins> The Revelatory Commission fostered a favorable environment in which the papers could be graciously delivered to humanity.
- <ins>1922</ins> An informal group of friends met on Sunday afternoons in Chicago for tea and discussions on various topics of interest.
- <ins>1925</ins> The writings of the Revelatory Commission were introduced to the Sunday afternoon discussion group. The core group was called the Contact Commission. A forum of people for further discussion was later formed.
- <ins>1925-1935</ins> During this era the Forum initiated questions and the Papers continued to be edited by the Revelatory Commission in response to the reactions of the Forum members while reading the papers.
- <ins>1934</ins> Parts I, II, and III of the revelation (excepting Paper 119) were sponsored, formulated, and put into the English language by various celestial authors. The first financial funds were raised to create plates to print the Book.
- <ins>1935</ins> Paper 119 of Part III was received, and Part IV was delivered as a completed manuscript.
- <ins>1937</ins> During this period Dr. Sadler and his son Bill had endeavored to write a Foreword for the Book. In response, a typewritten Foreword was provided by the revelators.
- <ins>1940</ins> Seventy Forum members attended weekly meetings to give talks and study the Book in-depth. The Forum officially ended in 1942.
- <ins>1941</ins> The printing plates were ordered from R. R. Donnelley and Sons Co, a major commercial printing company based in Chicago, Illinois.
- <ins>1950</ins> The Urantia Foundation was established as a non-profit organization and began preparing for publication by raising the necessary funds.
- <ins>1954</ins> Last message claimed to have been received from revelators ‘You are now on your own.’ The timing for book publication was now the Foundation's decision.
- <ins>1955</ins> A fraternal social organization was launched called the Urantia Brotherhood with a General Council of 36 members.
- <ins>1955</ins> _The Urantia Book_ arrived from the printers and people could at last hold it in their hands. The price was $10.00. The office was located at 533 Diversey Parkway in Chicago, where it remains to this time.


## Published Accounts of the History and Origin

These accounts were written by people closely associated with the events surrounding the receipt and publication of the Urantia Papers. They are strikingly consistent. Many are firsthand accounts, while others have gathered information from the earliest of records. This is a fortunate circumstance as it gives authenticity to those significant reports.

A History of the Urantia Papers

Larry Mullins with Dr. Meredith Sprunger.

In addition to providing new details and insights into the known stories of the origin of the Papers, the Mullins/Sprunger book chronicles the development of the text through its various printings since 1955. The authors also examine in detail the apocryphal stories that have been used in the creation of proprietary entitlement attitudes toward control of the Urantia Papers.

A collection of reference documents has also been compiled corresponding to the endnotes in A History of the Urantia Papers.

The Urantia Book Historical Society

The purpose of this organization is to collect primary and secondary source materials and oral histories. The library went on-line to the public in July 2007. The Society continues to scan and add donated documents to the library. It also keeps up with current publications and organizational records of Urantia Book organizations.

There is an exception to the acceptable record of events:

[URANTIA: The Great Cult Mystery](https://www.amazon.com/Urantia-Great-Mystery-Martin-Gardner/dp/0879759550)

By Martin Gardner. 1995.

This publication is poorly researched, contains errors and misinformation, and is an example of an unworthy effort to discredit the revelation.

Several well regarded Urantia Book readers have published detailed accounts of the exceedingly poor scholarship shown by Gardner.
