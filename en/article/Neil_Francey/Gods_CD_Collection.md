Disclaimer: The ideas expressed here are purely speculative. They have no basis in revelation and are merely a personal observation. These concepts in no way compare with the scholarly astronomical research and deductions being made by professional analysts of the Urantia revelation. [My thanks to Nigel Nunn for his invaluable interest and comments about this article.]

Such musings are in good company, as on numerous occasions in the quotations below, the revelators say effectively (as on <a id="s14_122"></a>[UB 56:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p7_6)): ‘_We do not know, but we speculate much concerning these and related matters._’

## Introduction

The vastness of the master universe is almost beyond measure, yet the revelators describe it as within a boundary. Does infinity then extend beyond that dimension, out into a fathomless darkness? Could there be other master universes located beyond the power, communication, and travel capabilities of the one presented to us?

In consideration of this idea, quotations from The Urantia Book are herein used extensively, with very little accompanying narrative. And with this first quote, considered in three segments, the revelators concisely describe the current environment, and it provides a basis for the overall speculation:

> _The central universe is the creation of eternity; the seven superuniverses are the creations of time; the four outer space levels are undoubtedly destined to eventuate-evolve the ultimacy of creation._
> 
> _And there are those who maintain that the Infinite can never attain full expression short of infinity; and therefore do they postulate an additional and unrevealed creation beyond the fourth and outermost space level, a possible ever-expanding, never-ending universe of infinity._
> 
> _In theory we do not know how to limit either the infinity of the Creator or the potential infinity of creation, but as it exists and is administered, we regard the master universe as having limitations, as being definitely delimited and bounded on its outer margins by open space._ <a id="s26_285"></a>[UB 12:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_16)

## The Extent Of The Master Universe

Such limitations as mentioned above do appear to exist for the Master Universe Architects. Their present realm is finite. So it is perplexing as to why the revelators repeatedly speak of an expansion to the current master universe, and yet offer no possible design for expansion. We must research it.

> _It is in connection with the segregation of potentials that the Architects of the Master Universe exist as the veritable embodiments of the Deity concept of the universes. Their plans appear to be ultimately space limited in extent by the concept periphery of the master universe, but as plans they are not otherwise conditioned by time or space._ <a id="s32_351"></a>[UB 118:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p4_6)

> _But energy, though springing from the Infinite, is not infinitely manifest; there are outer limits to the presently conceived master universe._ <a id="s34_147"></a>[UB 42:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_7)

However creation does contain an infinity of potential. Thus any extension of the master universe could be upheld by the powers even now existing within the Isle of Paradise. So where and how could further expansion occur?

> _The creation of every new universe calls for a new adjustment of gravity; but even if creation should continue indefinitely, eternally, even to infinity, so that eventually the material creation would exist without limitations, still the power of control and co-ordination reposing in the Isle of Paradise would be found equal to, and adequate for, the mastery, control, and co-ordination of such an infinite universe. ... the Unqualified Absolute would still be undiminished ..._ <a id="s38_484"></a>[UB 3:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p4_2)

This potential for all finite creation, and any further finite or infinite creation, would be contained within the powers of Paradise itself.

> _It appears to us that the First Source and Center has concentrated all absolute potential for cosmic reality in Paradise as a part of his technique of self-liberation from infinity limitations, as a means of making possible subinfinite, even time-space, creation. But it does not follow that Paradise is time-space limited just because the universe of universes discloses these qualities. Paradise exists without time and has no location in space._ <a id="s42_452"></a>[UB 11:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_10)

The domains of the Unqualified Absolute extend beyond the outer borders of the seven superuniverses. Could its function and space presence be the key to the extension of the influence of Paradise?

> _Space is not infinite, even though it takes origin from Paradise; not absolute, for it is pervaded by the Unqualified Absolute. We do not know the absolute limits of space, but we do know that the absolute of time is eternity._ <a id="s46_231"></a>[UB 12:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_2)

## Current Universe Formation

Paradise is made of a single form of materialization. Could it materialize its existing realm of energy and pattern further, without it being a duplication?

> _The eternal Isle is composed of a single form of materialization stationary systems of reality. This literal substance of Paradise is a homogeneous organization of space potency not to be found elsewhere in all the wide universe of universes. ... It is Paradise, and Paradise is without duplicate._ <a id="s52_302"></a>[UB 11:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_9)

> _Pattern is a master design from which copies are made. Eternal Paradise is the absolute of patterns._ <a id="s54_105"></a>[UB 0:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_13)

Consider how Havona came into existence and the possibility that such a process can be repeated. Its protective boundary holds creative energy within.

> _The God of Action functions and the dead vaults of space are astir. One billion perfect spheres flash into existence. Prior to this hypothetical eternity moment the space-energies inherent in Paradise are existent and potentially operative, but they have no actuality of being; neither can physical gravity be measured except by the reaction of material realities to its incessant pull. There is no material universe at this (assumed) eternally distant moment, but the very instant that one billion worlds materialize, there is in evidence gravity sufficient and adequate to hold them in the everlasting grasp of Paradise._ <a id="s58_627"></a>[UB 8:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p1_4)

> _The Infinite Spirit eternalizes concurrently with the birth of the Havona worlds, this central universe being created by him and with him and in him in obedience to the combined concepts and united wills of the Father and the Son._ <a id="s60_235"></a>[UB 8:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p1_7)

The revelators have no records prior to the existence of Havona. That is, there is no record concerning the existence of Paradise. So there may well have been other activity in the eternal past, but they are not aware of it.

> _In brief, the Infinite Spirit testifies that, since he is eternal, so also is the central universe eternal. And this is the traditional starting point of the history of the universe of universes. Absolutely nothing is known, and no records are in existence, regarding any event or transaction prior to this stupendous eruption of creative energy and administrative wisdom that crystallized the vast universe which exists, and so exquisitely functions, at the center of all things. Beyond this event lie the unsearchable transactions of eternity and the depths of infinity absolute mystery._ <a id="s64_594"></a>[UB 8:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p1_9)

As the revelators cannot be sure of the forces creating worlds beyond the present organized superuniverse borders, it is reasonable to suggest they are unaware of any other creative activity beyond the known master universe.

> _Who, or what, is really responsible for the gigantic activities of forceenergy transmutations now in progress out beyond the borders of the present seven superuniverses?_ <a id="s68_174"></a>[UB 12:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_2)

## Energies Of Creation

Then there is this astounding revelation. Even with the stupendous grand universe, only 5% of absolute gravity is applied to the organized universes. However is it reasonable to expect the outer rings to consume the remaining 95%, and there would be no further gravity to support other creations from our Isle of Paradise? The revelators hare already identified over 70,000 equivalent superuniverses so far in outer rings of the master universe. The scope and potential for further expansion is beyond imagining, and the comparative size of Orvonton is very very small indeed.

> _These investigators reach the amazing conclusion that the central universe and the surrounding seven superuniverses are at the present time making use of only about five per cent of the active functioning of the Paradise absolute-gravity grasp. In other words: At the present moment about ninety-five per cent of the active cosmic-gravity action of the Isle of Paradise, computed on this totality theory, is engaged in controlling material systems beyond the borders of the present organized universes. These calculations all refer to absolute gravity; linear gravity is an interactive phenomenon which can be computed only by knowing the actual Paradise gravity._ <a id="s74_668"></a>[UB 12:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_8)

## What Ideas Can Be Drawn From All This?

In his excellent research, Nigel Nunn has described creation as follows: ‘My model of Orvonton’s major sectors are CD-like (100:1 diameter : thickness ratio); so too Havona, having the geometry of a disk a mere one world thick. Likewise is the entire grand universe, which is portrayed as a breathtakingly thin ellipse (1,000:1 diameter : thickness ratio).’

So space is occupied at a relative infinite distance in a plane that extends in a possible horizontal radius from Paradise. Could such an equivalent realm of space exist equally in a location existing above and below Paradise and the current grand universe? Are there other such gigantic wheels in space?

> _In form Paradise differs from the inhabited space bodies: it is not spherical. It is definitely ellipsoid, being one-sixth longer in the northsouth diameter than in the east-west diameter. The central Isle is essentially flat, and the distance from the upper surface to the nether surface is one tenth that of the east-west diameter._ <a id="s82_338"></a>[UB 11:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_2)

And why is nether Paradise flat? Could it be that Paradise is positioned within a perpendicular column of infinite Paradise potential that can actuate from a nether side resulting in a series of such Isles of Paradise?

> _Directly underneath the location of the Trinity, in the central portion of nether Paradise, is the unknown and unrevealed Zone of Infinity._ <a id="s86_144"></a>[UB 11:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p5_2)

> _The gravity forces of the material universes are convergent in the gravity center of nether Paradise._ <a id="s88_106"></a>[UB 0:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_13)

> _Roughly: Space seemingly originates just below nether Paradise; time just above upper Paradise. ... Paradise in nonspacial; hence its areas are absolute and therefore serviceable in many ways beyond the concept of mortal mind._ <a id="s90_231"></a>[UB 11:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_11)

And we learn that material reality centers on nether Paradise.

> _This cohesive correlation of the material universe is best understood by all personalities — material, morontia, absonite, or spiritual — by the observation of the gravity response of all bona fide material reality to the gravity centering on nether Paradise._ <a id="s94_264"></a>[UB 56:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_2)

So does God have a CD collection? Could the central energy channel of Paradise materialize in its unique form at various levels? Could it contain a series of Paradise manifestations that are launched from the nether sides, there to usher in another Havona and further grand universe wheels across other lower and successive levels of created space?

> _The phenomena indigenous to the nether side of Paradise probably embrace three zones of absolute force presence and performance: the fulcral zone of the Unqualified Absolute, the zone of the Isle of Paradise itself, and the intervening zone of certain unidentified equalizing and compensating agencies or functions._ <a id="s98_320"></a>[UB 42:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_4)

> _Primordial force. This represents the first basic change in space potency and may be one of the nether Paradise functions of the Unqualified Absolute. We know that the space presence going out from nether Paradise is modified in some manner from that which is incoming._ <a id="s100_274"></a>[UB 42:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_7)

## Horizontal And Vertical Space

The relationship between horizontal pervaded space and vertical unpervaded space is another revelation to be considered. The creative intent for the unpervaded area is not known by the revelators but they do speculate about it. And there actually exists a counterbalance between the two dimensions.

> _We do not know the actual mechanism of space respiration; we merely observe that all space alternately contracts and expands. This respiration affects both the horizontal extension of pervaded space and the vertical extensions of unpervaded space which exist in the vast space reservoirs above and below Paradise. In attempting to imagine the volume outlines of these space reservoirs, you might think of an hourglass._ <a id="s106_423"></a>[UB 11:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_1)

> _As the universes of the horizontal extension of pervaded space expand, the reservoirs of the vertical extension of unpervaded space contract and vice versa. There is a confluence of pervaded and unpervaded space just underneath nether Paradise. Both types of space there flow through the transmuting regulation channels, where changes are wrought making pervadable space nonpervadable and vice versa in the contraction and expansion cycles of the cosmos._ <a id="s108_459"></a>[UB 11:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_2)

All such potential would come from Paradise.

> _And Paradise is the actual source of all material universes — past, present, and future._ <a id="s112_93"></a>[UB 56:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_1)

And that potential is reckoned within horizontal space in a plane. However, does a vertical dimension need to be considered?

> _There is an upper and a lower limit to horizontal space with reference to any given location in the universes. If one could move far enough at right angles to the plane of Orvonton, either up or down, eventually the upper or lower limit of pervaded space would be encountered. Within the known dimensions of the master universe these limits draw farther and farther apart at greater and greater distances from Paradise; space thickens, and it thickens somewhat faster than does the plane of creation, the universes._ <a id="s116_520"></a>[UB 11:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_6)

## Description Of The Master Universe

> _The Outer Space Levels. Far out in space, at an enormous distance from the seven inhabited superuniverses, there are assembling vast and unbelievably stupendous circuits of force and materializing energies. Between the energy circuits of the seven superuniverses and this gigantic outer belt of force activity, there is a space zone of comparative quiet, which varies in width but averages about four hundred thousand light-years._ <a id="s120_435"></a>[UB 12:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14)

> _The superuniverse of Orvonton is illuminated and warmed by more than ten trillion blazing suns. These suns are the stars of your observable astronomic system. More than two trillion are too distant and too small ever to be seen from Urantia. But in the master universe there are as many suns as there are glasses of water in the oceans of your world._ <a id="s122_355"></a>[UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10)

> _... we already are able to identify the clustering of at least seventy thousand aggregations of matter, each of which is greater than any one of the present superuniverses._ <a id="s124_177"></a>[UB 31:10.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_19)

> _This alternate zoning of the master universe, in association with the alternate clockwise and counterclockwise flow of the galaxies, is a factor in the stabilization of physical gravity designed to prevent the accentuation of gravity pressure to the point of disruptive and dispersive activities._ <a id="s126_301"></a>[UB 11:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_9)

We are informed about the ‘flat’ design of the grand universe, but information about the master universe is lacking in equivalent detail. There are ‘universes upon universes’ which may mean ‘many’, or literally, they are stacked, and thus not in a ‘flat’ plane as is the grand universe. In the following quotations, reference is made to the _circular_ nature of the master universe, and also that it is a _horizontal_ extension of pervaded space. How do the _tremendous wheels of energizing forces_ relate to the wheel design of the grand universe?

> _The observable behavior of the material creation constitutes evidence of a physical universe of definite limits. The final proof of both a circular and delimited universe is afforded by the, to us, well-known fact that all forms of basic energy ever swing around the curved path of the space levels of the master universe in obedience to the incessant and absolute pull of Paradise gravity._ <a id="s130_395"></a>[UB 12:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_1)

> _Proceeding outward from Paradise through the horizontal extension of pervaded space, the master universe is existent in six concentric ellipses, the space levels encircling the central Isle._ <a id="s132_195"></a>[UB 12:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_3)

> _But about one-half million light-years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe we observe the beginnings of a zone of an unbelievable energy action which increases in volume and intensity for over twenty-five million light-years. These tremendous wheels of energizing forces are situated in the first outer space level, a continuous belt of cosmic activity encircling the whole of the known, organized, and inhabited creation._ <a id="s134_442"></a>[UB 12:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14)

> _Still greater activities are taking place beyond these regions, for the Uversa physicists have detected early evidence of force manifestations more than fifty million light-years beyond the outermost ranges of the phenomena in the first outer space level. These activities undoubtedly presage the organization of the material creations of the second outer space level of the master universe._ <a id="s136_396"></a>[UB 12:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_15)

Some revelators postulate creation beyond the present master universe. But it has limitations on outer margins by open space, as described in the first quote in this article. So there are questions about the design of such expansion.

And then there is the stupendous new allocation of personalities. They progress from the grand universe to the master universe, and imply something beyond the master universe. To where might they then progress?

> _During the present universe age the administrative co-ordination of the master universe is the function of the Architects of the Master Universe. But the appearance of the Almighty Supreme at the termination of the present universe age will signify that the evolutionary finite has attained the first stage of experiential destiny. This happening will certainly lead to the completed function of the first experiential Trinity — the union of the Supreme Creators, the Supreme Being, and the Architects of the Master Universe. This Trinity is destined to effect the further evolutionary integration of the master creation._ <a id="s142_626"></a>[UB 106:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p3_2)

> _The space-stage of the master universe seems to be adequate for the actualization of the Supreme Being, for the formation and full function of the Trinity Ultimate, for the eventuation of God the Ultimate, and even for the inception of the Trinity Absolute. But our concepts regarding the full function of this second experiential Trinity seem to imply something beyond even the wide-spreading master universe._ <a id="s144_415"></a>[UB 106:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p6_2)

## Space Respiration

Space respiration is an essential mechanism of the universe of universes. Such a counterbalance could also apply to the opposing expansion and contraction cycles of grand or master universes in alternate CD's. The vertical expansion mentioned in relation to the hourglass configuration could be a means of stabilizing and positioning each vertically located master universe. Also, the hourglass field may be the interconnector of one level to the next.

> _“Unpervaded” space means: unpervaded by those forces, energies, powers, and presences known to exist in pervaded space. We do not know whether vertical (reservoir) space is destined always to function as the equipoise of horizontal (universe) space; we do not know whether there is a creative intent concerning unpervaded space; we really know very little about the space reservoirs, merely that they exist, and that they seem to counterbalance the space-expansion-contraction cycles of the universe of universes._ <a id="s150_518"></a>[UB 11:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_3)

Could the hourglass be used for travel from one CD to the next? Could the expansion and contraction also be a function relating to access and travel?

> _The cycles of space respiration extend in each phase for a little more than one billion Urantia years._ <a id="s154_107"></a>[UB 11:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_4)

As the quiescent midspace zones impinge on Paradise separating pervaded and unpervaded space, and separating the seven superuniverses from the first outer space level, perhaps there are such midspace zones separating the successive space levels of horizontally stacked CD's.

> _To finite creatures of the grand universe the concept of the master universe seems to be well-nigh infinite, but doubtless the absonite architects thereof perceive its relatedness to future and unimagined developments within the unending I AM. Even space itself is but an ultimate condition, a condition of qualification within the relative absoluteness of the quiet zones of midspace._ <a id="s158_390"></a>[UB 106:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p7_7)

## The Divine Plan Has Pattern

And there is a pattern existing from the eternal past:

> _The First Source and Center, who is Father to the Eternal Son, is also Pattern to the Paradise Isle. He is personality unqualified in the Son but personality potentialized in the Deity Absolute. The Father is energy revealed in Paradise-Havona and at the same time energy concealed in the Unqualified Absolute._ <a id="s164_315"></a>[UB 104:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p3_13)

The circuits of the Father, Son, and Spirit, could be the travel and communications hubs for the column of Paradise materialization:

> _All twenty-one are enormous spheres, and each group of seven is differently eternalized. As far as we know they have always been; like Paradise they are eternal. There exists neither record nor tradition of their origin._ <a id="s168_225"></a>[UB 13:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/13#p0_2)

Then the process and pattern of creation continues with the creation of Havona. This could be followed by the creation of a grand universe design.

> _The Seven Master Spirits radiate their influence out from the central Isle, thus constituting the vast creation one gigantic wheel, the hub being the eternal Isle of Paradise, the seven spokes the radiations of the Seven Master Spirits, the rim the outer regions of the grand universe._ <a id="s172_290"></a>[UB 15:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p0_1)

## And Why Not One More Idea? 

The original pattern of Paradise is perfection. Perhaps the creation of the first master universe naturally eventuated as totally perfect. It could well have been created in, or could have attained, light and life an eternity ago.

A second CD could have eventuated from Paradise, divesting from the first location, with the creation of a perfected grand universe, that is, perfected except for the outer rings. There would be a perfect Havona, and seven superuniverses created in light and life, and peopled by those from the previously perfectly created master universe. The outer rings would be for experiential evolving life.

Successive down stepping in stages of perfection arrives at our current master universe with its combined level of created perfection and evolving perfection. Our master universe sees the concept of a Supreme Being emerge from the experiential worlds of the seven superuniverses. And those from the seven superuniverses might see the development of the four outer rings which they could one day help to bring to light and life, perhaps as members of the Corps of the Finality.

> _If and when the grand universe becomes settled in light and life, what then will be the future function of the Creator-Creative manifestations of God the Sevenfold if God the Supreme assumes direct control of these creations of time and space? Are these organizers and pioneers of the time-space universes to be liberated for similar activities in outer space? We do not know, but we speculate much concerning these and related matters._ <a id="s182_441"></a>[UB 56:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p7_6)

> _We often ponder: If the grand universe should be settled in light and life, would the ascending exquisite mortals still be destined to the Corps of the Finality? But we do not know._ <a id="s184_186"></a>[UB 55:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p6_10)

As Paradise could infinitely exist in its own energy field, at any time and in any controlled position, could it manifest a related Havona and space wheel? There would be no reason to locate another Master Universe System in some randomly situated realm of empty space. Surely it would not then be within the existing energy grid, and it would lack ready access for personnel, for communication, and for travel.

This creation of another Havona could be achieved as Havona is one physically with Paradise although separate functionally:

> _The Havona planetary circuits are not superimposed; their worlds follow each other in an orderly linear procession. The central universe whirls around the stationary Isle of Paradise in one vast plane, consisting of ten concentric stabilized units — the three circuits of Paradise spheres and the seven circuits of Havona worlds. Physically regarded, the Havona and the Paradise circuits are all one and the same system; their separation is in recognition of functional and administrative segregation._ <a id="s190_506"></a>[UB 14:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_10)

The Paradise Field would control and draw all energy to itself. The master universe is a perfectly balanced and totally unified creation cantered in, and controlled from, the Central Isle of Paradise. Its design, if not especially ‘flat’, must still connect to the wheel that emanates from Paradise.

> _Energy is eternal but not infinite; it ever responds to the all-embracing grasp of Infinity. Forever force and energy go on; having gone out from Paradise, they must return thereto, even if age upon age be required for the completion of the ordained circuit. That which is of Paradise Deity origin can have only a Paradise destination or a Deity destiny._ <a id="s194_359"></a>[UB 42:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_8)

## But For Now, Back To Earth

The master universe may be the perfect and final design of the Universal Father, functioning in its own plane, and complete in its overall pattern, with no expansion beyond the four outer rings. However, as mentioned in the opening quotation about the revelators: ‘_... they postulate an additional and unrevealed creation beyond the fourth and outermost space level._’

Infinite God has created this as yet finite, circular, and far-flung universe of universes, without any evidence of energy depletion. It is a limitless adventure of divinity attainment for universe explorers, and it has only just begun. And certain victory awaits all those who enter the race for perfection with faith and trust in a personal God, and with Michael's guidance by the Spirit of Truth.

And perhaps this speculation about CD's is not totally unreasonable:

> _At the inconceivably distant future eternity moment of the final completion of the entire master universe, no doubt we will all look back upon its entire history as only the beginning, simply the creation of certain finite and transcendental foundations for even greater and more enthralling metamorphoses in uncharted infinity. At such a future eternity moment the master universe will still seem youthful; indeed, it will be always young in the face of the limitless possibilities of neverending eternity._ <a id="s204_512"></a>[UB 106:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p7_8)

> All shall be revealed in good time: _Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors._ <a id="s206_183"></a>[UB 101:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2)

## All This Raises Further Questions:

The revelators on two occasions in the quotations above speculate about what might happen if and when the grand universe is settled in light and life. But what is God going to do on that distant day when our master universe is approaching light and life?

What then would be the future of the eternal careers offered to all perfect beings, and perfected beings:

- A Universal Censor, under authority of the Ancients of Days, confirms there is a ‘_mystery which enshrouds the future of the finaliters_’.
- And what are the sovereign functions of the Supreme Being in the master universe when of completed realization in the grand universe?
- What is the destiny of Master Sons after they reach Absonite levels in the master universe? Will Michael collaborate with the Supreme Being in the first experiential Trinity of the outer space universes?
- What happens to the work of the Seven Master Spirits after the grand universe reaches light and life? Do they have an equivalent order for the master universe and even beyond?
- What is the ongoing role of the Architects of the Master Universe after this one is designed?
- What are the destinies of many of the ‘revealed few’ grand universe personalities on <a id="s219_87"></a>[UB 30:1.112](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p1_112), and the ‘unrevealed many’?
- With the completed actualization of the three absolute potentials, the Unqualified, Universal, and Deity Absolutes, it would be possible to conceive of the final integration of total reality in the latency of the I AM.

Would they not need to go and populate another Paradise, Havona, grand universe, or outer space ring, as God is never static? How many personnel would be available from over tens of thousands of superuniverses?

Perhaps God will add an additional three rings beyond the current fourth and outermost space level, the total becoming seven. Totaling I wonder, how many superuniverses? And across how many tens of millions of light-years?

Or will God add another CD to his collection?
