I discovered _The URANTIA Book_ in 1977 while visiting a friend in Phoenix, Arizona. The Book changed my life. Until then God could not contact me through any channel that I knew. _The URANTIA Book_ became the channel for me to comprehend my relationship (sonship) with Him.

I have read the blue Book in its entirety once and parts of it many, many times. Over the years I have formed simple explanations of Urantia concepts that I only partly understand. I shall offer them to you — not as an interpretation of the truth within the Book — but as the image within my mind that I receive as I try to understand the Urantia message.

I accept that God always existed. Being a creature of time and space, the statement to my mind is illogical and cannot be true. However, it is my will to do the will of God and I believe it is His will that I accept that statement.

I believe that the physical things I can see and comprehend and the things I reason to exist and cannot comprehend can be called ‘existence’. I divide ‘existence’ into God provoked (occupied) and emptiness. In one sentence: in emptiness nothing works — there are no senses, no will. God's occupied space is like the space inside a balloon which is in a room. Everything outside the balloon is emptiness. God is blowing up the balloon but the boundaries of the room are infinity.

If you will permit me to give God a human attribute, let me say GOD IS LONELY. God can make perfect human beings — as men can make robots. We can program a robot to say it loves us like God can create people to make them love him. For the statement to be true the robot, or created human, must have a free will in order to give truth to the statement. The ability to say “No, I don't love you” must also be programmed into a subject with the free will to say it. Without free will any statement is a tape being played.

I believe that God is in the process of surrounding himself with creatures (or whatever descriptive word you use) that keep him company of their own free will.

On Urantia the pre-creature is a human being who possesses a free will and a Thought Adjuster. The human free will and the Thought Adjuster create a soul. The merging of a Thought Adjuster and a soul can be likened to ‘human conception’.

Michael, a creator son, was allowed to create pre-creatures such as humans. Lucifer, another order of sons, rebelled by saying that Michael's creatures were flawed and his plan, as designed and activated by Michael, needed to be changed. He actively resisted Michael's plan.

Michael's bestowal on earth was Michael's proof that a human being could achieve perfection. He came to Urantia as Jesus, allowed Lucifer to attempt to corrupt the human Jesus and Lucifer failed, thus proving to the Ancient of Days that Michael's plan works. Michael was granted full authority to proceed with his mission in Nebadon.

God invited man to join him in eternity. A part of God, the Mystery Monitor, is within most of our minds. It is our free will to accept or decline immortality. The bridge from doubt to belief in God is not built on fact or proof, it is built on faith. Once you cross the bridge of faith to the solid ground of belief one finds the 'proof' one desires.

We bring to God the gift of our uniqueness — for nowhere else in creation does the individual ‘us’ exist, or ever existed or ever will exist again. The reincarnation that we ‘feel’ has happened to us, actually means we ‘feel’ the past experience of our Thought Adjuster.

Some day, for many of us, shall come the time when we stand on the shores of Paradise — me, the unique individual who has emerged and mixed with the piece of God and thus are an eternal part of God, made so by our free will.

**Dealing with others**

When you are committed to freely doing the will of God you must remember, as you deal with people, that they too are the children of God and resting within each of them is a personal piece of God.

Therefore it is prudent to deal fairly with his children, for he will certainly remember any action to the contrary. 

**Prayer**

I prayed more during the part of my life when I was searching for how God could find me. Now that he has revealed himself to me through _The URANTIA Book_ I have less need for prayer. My prayers are divided. I feel the need to express my gratitude for being accepted as a son of God. I'm thankful for the Spirit of Truth which made my faith strong enough to truly believe in God. The teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ permits me to find my place in God's infinite scheme — and I am contented. I accept that Urantia is peopled by creatures of free will who, of their own free will, may choose to do me harm. I must suffer that injustice. At times I am a child who asks for favours from a Father. I believe that my Father in heaven will grant me the answer to my prayer if the granting is in my best interest.

**Who is God?**

God is everything. He is everything that is within the 'balloon'. God gives direction to his reality and that ‘brain’ is located in Paradise. He has created an “Eternal Son” as his face. When it is our destiny to 'see' God in Paradise, we shall gaze upon the form of the Eternal Son and see the face of God.

These are some of my thoughts on _The URANTIA Book_ which may be of interest to you and your readers.
