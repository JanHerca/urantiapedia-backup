_By Marta Elders, associate trustee, Urantia Foundation, Connecticut, United States_

_Editor's Note: Claire Mylanus, chair of the symposium, Marta Elders, and Marilynn Kulieke have been planning this gathering over the past few years in order to support the international efforts of Urantia Foundation. We are grateful for the time and energy of the participants for bringing to life this momentous occasion!_

The Education Committee of Urantia Foundation is pleased to announce a cultural symposium to be held at the Foundation from April 11 to 15.

Men and women from different countries will gather to share their research, personal perspectives, and unique understanding of their native culture and environment.

The purpose of the symposium is to help the trustees and staff of Urantia Foundation to better understand and appreciate the opportunities—and the challenges—for advancing the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and making the book itself available in their native countries.

Each participant has been invited to give a presentation about cultural aspects such as spiritual beliefs, religion, the political climate, the status of women and the family, educational opportunities, art, and philosophy. Participants will focus on the following topics, each of which has been illuminated and guided by quotes from _The Urantia Book_.

## Religious Development

- Modern religion
- Prevailing belief system
- Attitudes toward religion and spirituality
- Organized and nondenominational religions and other spiritual beliefs

## Current, Past, and Future Culture

- The importance of the family
- The value of women
- The status of education (science, philosophy, and religion)
