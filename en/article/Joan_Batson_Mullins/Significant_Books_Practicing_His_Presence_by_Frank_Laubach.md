> “Can I bring the Lord back in my mind-flow every few seconds so that God shall always be in my mind? I choose to make the rest of my life an experiment in answering this question.” p. 10

Frank Laubach's great “experiment” started in a missionary outpost in 1929. His letters chronicling his attempt to live every moment in the presence of God are startling in their depth and simplicity.

The SeedSowers publishing house has combined the letters of Frank Laubach and a new updated version of Brother Lawrence's _The Practice of the Presence of God_, into one book entitled _Practicing His Presence_. The experiences of these two men, one from the 17 th century and the other from the 20th, in their quest for unbroken communion, will kindle hope in all those who aspire to this seemingly unobtainable goal. Since many of us are familiar with Brother Lawrence's three hundred year old classic, which has never been out of print, we'll focus on a few of Frank Laubach's discoveries.

> “As I analyze myself I find several things happening to me as a result of ... strenuous effort to keep the Lord in mind every minute. This concentration on God is strenuous, but everything else has ceased to be so. I think more clearly, I forget less frequently. Things which I did with a strain before, I now do easily and with no effort whatever. I worry about nothing...I no longer feel in a hurry about anything. Everything goes right.” p. 15

In the Urantia Papers we are told of Jesus: “The secret of his unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of God; and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship-unbroken communion with God...” <a id="a44_231"></a>[[UB 196:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_10)]. And we are encouraged to attempt it ourselves: “.. the divine bestowals may flow to the hearts and souls of those who thus remember to maintain unbroken communion with their Maker...” <a id="a44_464"></a>[[UB 194:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_20)]. Laubach responds to the question of how one is to remember: “ $B y$ forming a new habit! All thought employs silent words and is really conversation with your inner self. Instead of talking to yourself, form the habit of talking to Christ... when evil thoughts of any kind come, say, 'Lord, these thoughts are not fit to discuss with you. Lord, you do the thinking. Renew my mind by your presence.” " p. 32

Laubach shares how his relationships have become imbued with a new affection: “_I choose to look at people through God, using God as my glasses, colored with His love for them._” p.25. Frank Laubach went on to become a world renowned educator, writing over 50 books, receiving many honors, and living “_one of the fullest lives ever lived by one of Christ's followers._” p. xiv

> “_And if you should forget Him for minutes or even days, do not groan or repent, but begin anew with a smile. Every minute can be a fresh beginning._” p.37
