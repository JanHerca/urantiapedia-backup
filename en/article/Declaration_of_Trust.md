Upon the expiration of the period for which such ancillary trustee is appointed or upon the revocation of such appointment, the ancillary trustee shall return to the Trustees hereunder all the Trust Estate in the hands of such ancillary trustee at the time of said termination or revocation: and a receipt or release from the Trustees hereunder to such ancillary trustee shall discharge such ancillary trustee from all responsibility in connection with their acts as such ancillary trustee in the administration, preservation, management, or safekeeping of the Trust Estate transferred to such ancillary trustee. An ancillary trustee appointed as in this paragraph provided shall not be under any obligation to require any accounting from the Trustees hereunder and shall not be responsible in any way for any acts of the Trustees, whether before or after the appointment of the ancillary trustee.

If such additional trustee or trustees shall be necessary, then the Trustees hereunder may confer upon and vest in any such additional trustee or trustees so appointed such powers and authority as the Trustees hereunder may deem advisable or necessary; provided, however, that the net income derived from any such real estate or other property, and the net proceeds arising from any sale thereof, shall be paid over by any such additional trustee or trustees then acting with reference to such real estate, to the Trustees, and shall be held and applied by the Trustees pursuant to the terms hereof. The instrument of appointment of such additional trustee or trustees shall be filed for record as provided in paragraph 9.1.

6.13. OPERATION OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISES: The Trustees shall have power to initiate, organize, and acquire and to maintain, continue, and operate, at the risk of the Subservient Estate and not at the risk of the Trustees, individually, any business enterprise which they may initiate, organize, or acquire, or which may be given, devised, or bequeathed to the Foundation, or to the Trustees thereof, or to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of such business enterprise, on such terms and for such consideration as the Trustees shall deem desirable, proper, or appropriate. The Trustees may initiate, organize, continue, and operate any such business enterprise under such name and style and in such place or places as the Trustees, in their sole discretion and judgment, shall deem proper or appropriate.

6.16. CUMULATIVE POWER AND AUTHORITY: The Trustees shall have full power to bind the Trust Estate without making themselves personally liable, and to do and perform any and all other acts which they may deem proper or appropriate for carrying out the objects for which the Foundation is created; and in general, subject to the limitation that the Trust Estate and the income therefrom and increments thereof shall be devoted to the objects for which the Foundation is created, the Trustees shall have every power and authority over the Trust Estate that they would have if, as individuals, they were jointly the absolute and unqualified owners thereof, and the enumeration of specific or special powers shall not be construed to limit or restrict the general powers and authority herein conferred by, or reasonably inferred from, the other provisions of this Declaration of Trust. None of the powers herein granted shall be exhausted by the exercise thereof but shall be continuing powers and may be exercised from time to time and as often as the Trustees, in their sole discretion and judgment, shall deem necessary, proper, or appropriate.

6.17. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES: No purchaser, contractee, lessee, mortgagee, pledgee, or holder of any contract, obligation, or encumbrance shall be obligated to see to the application of the purchase moneys, rents, moneys borrowed or advanced upon or against the Trust Estate, or other moneys paid to the Trustees, or be obligated to see that the terms of this Declaration of Trust have been complied with, or be obligated to inquire into the necessity or expediency of any acts of the Trustees.
