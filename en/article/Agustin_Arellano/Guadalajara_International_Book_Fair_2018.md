The Guadalajara International Book Fair is the most important publishing gathering in Ibero-America. It is also an amazing cultural festival. Created 32 years ago by the University of Guadalajara, the Fair is aimed at professionals and the general public alike, a characteristic that sets it apart from other book fairs around the globe. With business  as one of its main goals, it is also a cultural festival in which literature plays a major role, including a program where authors from all continents and languages participate, and a forum for the academic discussion of issues. For nine days, people willingly stand in long lines to listen to their favorite authors. The book industry makes Guadalajara its beating heart and the whole city is filled with the music, arts, cinema and theater.
