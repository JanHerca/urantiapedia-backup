*Charlene Morrow, Edmond OK*

<p style="text-align:center;">
It happened on the very last Wednesday <br>
Almost all the bright days were gone <br>
It was a day of rest, as was their way <br>
The master walked toward the hills alone<br>
<br>
Guards were offered for him by <br>
David Knowing that these were times of danger <br>
But with legions of angels awaiting his bid <br>
He had no fear of friend or stranger<br>
<br>
He walked away, but in a short time <br>
Was offered a basket of food for the day <br>
He reached for the handle ready to climb <br>
And turned to walk on his solitary way<br>
<br>
John Mark held on to the basket <br>
Gripping on firmly and strong <br>
He’d made up his mind to carry it <br>
If needed for all the day long<br>
<br>
The apostles, they couldn’t believe their eyes <br>
They were shocked at the temerity of the lad <br>
Deep in their hearts they could not deny <br>
They were jealous, lonely, and sad<br>
<br>
Later on Nathaniel spoke to them <br>
And told them how they could each <br>
Have had the chance to join him <br>
If they’d wanted to be there in reach<br>
<br>
Young John held on intently <br>
The man could only smile <br>
And look down upon him gently <br>
Letting him come all the while<br>
<br>
All the boy desired was the pleasure <br>
Of ministering to his loved one <br>
The yearning which no heart can measure <br>
Since he felt as if he were a son<br>
<br>
The two, they had such a good visit <br>
The conversation, so private was it all <br>
The master made comment of it <br>
That to no one a word should fall<br>
<br>
A unique day in time and space <br>
But not so strange or odd <br>
If any had wanted so badly could face <br>
A day alone with God<br>
</p>
