Traditional hymns revised to reflect the values of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

**Amazing Grace**

Amazing grace, how great the love, 
that saved a soul like me!
I once was blind, but now I see, 
was bound but now am free!

'Twas grace that taught my heart to love, 
and grace God's love receive;
How precious does that grace appear 
to my soul from fear relieved.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares, 
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, 
and grace will lead me home.

'Tis grace that leads me to the good, 
God's truth my life secures;
God's perfect will my standard be, 
as long as life endures.

And when we arrive on Paradise 
and eternal life is won,
We've no less time to sing God's praise 
than when we'd first begun.
