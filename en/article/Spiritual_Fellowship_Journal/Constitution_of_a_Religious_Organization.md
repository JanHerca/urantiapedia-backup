1. The Father/Motherhood of God and the brother/sisterhood of all people is the guiding principle of the Fellowship. We acknowledge as kindred spirits all individuals and traditions, past and present, who recognize this principle. Recognition of the religion of Jesus as the ultimate ideal of living is central in our teaching, but we seek to avoid all forms of coercive literalism and legalism. The scriptures used for worship and education in the Fellowship shall be _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible as well as passages of scripture from the varied religions of the world which portray spiritual wisdom.
2. The Fellowship is ecumenical and nonsectarian in orientation. We accept into membership people from all backgrounds who recognize the Parenthood of God and the kinship of humankind as interpreted by the teachings of Jesus. The Fellowship seeks to relate to all people in love and recognizes this kindred fellowship of all humanity.
3. The Fellowship seeks to develop ritual and ceremony which symbolize the highest values of truth, beauty, and goodness, the supreme value of love, along with the values of family and of social communion found in group life. We recognize the freedom of each local group to evolve its own ritual and symbolism, which shall include the sacrament of the Remembrance Supper, as well as such other rites as the local group may desire.
4. The Fellowship recognizes the key role of evolution and growth in the process of the life of each individual and religious group.
5. The Fellowship seeks to foster the most inspiring intellectual, emotional, and service sentiments of humanity and promote loyalty to such values and activities and to the groups and individuals who strive to actualize them.
6. The Fellowship strives to facilitate spiritual progress, enhance cosmic insight, augment moral values, encourage social development, and stimulate the highest expression of personal religious living.
7. The Fellowship assists its members to visualize and articulate supreme purposes and goals of living for both time and eternity. It seeks to stimulate and support them in the actualization of these objectives.
8. The Fellowship seeks to support, honor, and enhance the values associated with the biologic, sociologic, and religious significance of the home.
9. The Fellowship acknowledges and affirms the mystery of personal and epochal revelation. We stand in awe at the incomprehensible love which God has for his imperfect finite children in bestowing upon us a fragment of his own Spirit essence to live with us and guide us toward reality and eternal life. We are confronted by the inexplicable efficacy of intercessory prayer and the mysterious integration and coordination of persons and events. We are challenged by the impossiblepossible potential of the spirit mastery of our animal drives and urges and the reality of spiritual transformation.
10. The Fellowship believes that most of its spiritual practices and symbolism should be so designed that it can be participated in by the individual, the family, and the entire religious group.
11. The Fellowship believes that ceremonies, rituals, and spiritual symbols should be relatively simple, filled with beauty and meaning. We seek to create a structure in which this symbolism and its related ceremonies may evolve.
12. The Fellowship recommends that each religious group provide in their local program opportunities for religious education, personal counseling, spiritual guidance, and group worship. These religious ministrations should dramatize spiritual loyalties, illuminate the lures of truth, beauty, and goodness, glorify the potential of family life, stimulate unselfish service and great friendship, conserve enlightened morality, support human welfare, and promote a wise outreach ministry to the world.
