Sensitize us, Universal Father, to your subliminal 
presence.

You are indigenous in our consciousness, the loving 
reality which is closer than our nearest friend.

You are the caring inner presence ever striving to 
shape and guide our thoughts, but never violating 
our will or autonomy.

You are our creative resource assisting us in translating
our animal-level minds into the higher estate of soul
consciousness, integrating our cognitive
center around your love, truth, and goodness.

Our minds transformed, we are born into a new level
of being. We live in the inner reality of your
presence filled with joy and undergirded by peace.

Living in the impregnable inner citadel of spiritual 
sureties, we are not overcome by catastrophic
planetary events or the rigors of human suffering.

We thank you, O Heavenly Mentor, for your saving and 
transforming presence in our lives!
