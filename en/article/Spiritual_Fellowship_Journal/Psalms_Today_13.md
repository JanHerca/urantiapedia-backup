Save us, Supreme Teacher, from the pride of learning, the 
arrogance of theological elitism, and the self-righteousness 
of tradition and orthodoxy.

Teach us to be mindful that your ways are open to the 
humble and the unlearned, but are often hidden by the 
self-interests of the proud, the affluent, and the
sophisticated.

Enlighen our realization that even though intellectual 
comprehension may be partial or erroneous, understanding 
of spiritual truth may be real and genuine.

Your truth, Universal Father, cannot be imprisoned in creeds, 
dogmas, or theological treatise, but flows freely through
living personalities.

The static forms of intellectualism fossilize your living 
and growing revelation of truth; but propohets in each
generation advance the understanding of your
progressive plan for humankind.

Deliver us, Supreme Teacher, from confusing political and 
economic action for the more basic spiritual transformation 
and dedication which is the foundation block of
social justice.

Save our religious fellowships, Heavenly Father, from 
secular entanglements that they may have a clear vision of 
your will and way and proclaim your goals and objectives 
for humankind.

Undergird and guide them as they spiritually sustain 
and nourish those who labor in the vineyards of the world,
that your will may increasingly be done on earth as it 
is in heaven.
