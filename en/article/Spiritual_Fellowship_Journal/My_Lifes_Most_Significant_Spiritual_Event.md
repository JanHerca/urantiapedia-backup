***_The Urantia Book_ and Spiritual Renewal***

_This feature is written by ministers. Since _The Urantia Book_ at this point in time is potentially controversial, the name of the author is sometimes withheld so as not to interfere with his or her rapport in ministry._

My contact with _The Urantia Book_ began with considerable skepticism. My initial reaction was that it was some sort of gnostic tome created by a cult of fanatics. My first attempted reading in the book, which was part of the Foreword, only added to the mystery, for despite my minor in philosophy and a degree in theology I was largely lost in a plethora of new words, concepts, and cosmology. So I put the book aside.

But my friend who had loaned me the book wanted feedback and explained that the book did not support gnosticism. He was a science teacher at the secondary level and in no way came across as a fanatic; indeed, he was a good Methodist! So I agreed to try reading in a different part of the book. I choose to read the story of Jesus' resurrection, a subject of considerable theological and philosophical importance to me. I was amazed to discover an account that made sense out of the differing Gospel records and it explained the disappearance of the material body of Jesus in a way that was original and very convincing.

> _My contact with _The Urantia Book_ began with considerable skepticism. My initial reaction was that it was some sort of gnostic tome created by a cult of fanatics._

And so I decided this book needed a fair hearing and I began to read on an almost daily basis beginning with paper one and continuing. Approximately halfway through the book I began to entertain serious thoughts about its possible authenticity, and gradually became more and more convinced as I continued reading.

One of the first and continuing aspects of _The Urantia Book_ that impressed me was that its cosmology made sense. Again and again. I commented to my friend that I was agreeing with what I was reading; that yes, I had a similar theory about the status of planet earth; that yes, I always wondered about the accuracy of Trinitarian theology, and Jesus as the Creator Son rather than the Eternal Son made more sense.

The second impressive thing about _The Urantia Book_ was that it presented new ideas, new concepts and united other disparate ideas and concepts. It began to feel like revelation and not speculation. The word “feel” is the best word I can think of, for this was not just an intellectual experience. I can tell you a great deal of prayer. including prayer for illumination and protection went into the first reading. As belief in its authenticity began to dawn upon my mind and soul, I was almost “beside myself” that such a marvelous truth was here, staring me in the face, in that big, heavy, blue book!

How has _The Urantia Book_ affected my life? It has significantly changed my attitude, deepened my faith, and altered my life style. It has changed my attitude toward other people. The importance of free will and the presence of the Thought Adjusters (Spirit of God) have resulted in my being less controlling toward others, more confident of God's work in their lives, and more patient. And at the same time, I have changed my attitude toward myself along the same lines.

I regard _The Urantia Book_ as the most significant spiritual event in my life to date. Since I believe in the validity of the scientific method, I regard the authenticity of _The Urantia Book_ as a serious issue. I realize that some do not worry about origins, yet the fact that so much of the book is devoted to rigorous detail in regard to history implies to me this is an area of value, just as its spiritual teachings have value.

I have not solved the problem of relating the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to organized Protestant Christianity, my religious background. Many of these people are closed minded. some even believing the book is “ a work of the devil.” Other friends, less prejudiced and fearful, have found the book to be the revolutionary spiritual storehouse I have experienced. And I look forward to the continued exposure to the teachings of Jesus, free from the distortions of the barnacles of tradition.
