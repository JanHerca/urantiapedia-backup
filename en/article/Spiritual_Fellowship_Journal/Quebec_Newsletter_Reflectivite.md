Here in Quebec, two tragic events have helped us to see people at their best: the flooding around Lake St. John and the ice storm in the Montreal region which left millions stranded without electricity and heat during the coldest part of the winter. The ice storm that Quebec has experienced gave us the opportunity to put the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to the test through loving service, brotherly help, tolerance and solidarity. Many generous souls opened up their homes to the disaster-stricken, sometimes without even having met those people before.

At the present time, when the international press is reporting barbaric acts perpetrated across the planet, we tend to believe that those barbarians show no human signs other than their external appearance. Consequently, it is very comforting to know that acts of love and generosity are also accomplished around the world by other humans. Love needs to be free. Thus, it is necessary that we all be free to choose to love or forsake God and our fellow man. When people nourish in their heart such spirit poisons as hate, vengeance and suspicion, they become a curse to our humanity by lowering themselves to a level below a beast. But when the love of God and our neighbor motivate our acts, we witness an overflow of generosity and become a blessing to humanity — alleluia!
