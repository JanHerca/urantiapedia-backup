## God's Co-workers

We thank you,our Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that 
you use lowly mortals as co-workers in establishing 
your kingdom on earth.

When the learned, the self-righteous, and the powerful 
thwart your progressive and liberating purposes, you 
welcome the aristocracy of the common people to 
carry out your plans.

We rejoice also, Universe Father, that your Spirit of Truth
inspires and works through leaders who are open to 
creative experience and serve in the actualization of 
eternal values.

These transcenders and forerunners of humanity are
governed by internal standards of truth and energized
with a vision of the beauty of creation and the
perfection of spirit reality.

They are your representatives dedicated to serve the 
common good and the larger purposes of planetary 
destiny.

We thank you for these prophets of a new day, these 
workers in your kingdom bringing peace and goodwill, 
justice and well-being to your people.

Our problems and suffering are alleviated through their 
ministrations, and our lives are blessed by their service.

The crushing weight of a burdened soul
the crippling anxiety of a troubled mind,
the constant pain of a diseased and broken body, 
the dehumanizing restraints of social injustice, 
are attended to and relieved by the intelligent 
and caring devotion of your ministers of mercy.

All of the resources of an advancing civilization 
are made possible by your divine plan of evolutionary
development and discovery;
they are your gifts of grace!

Glory and honor, praise and thanksgiving fill our hearts 
and well up in our souls, Universal Father; you have our 
love and devotion in time and eternity! (45)

## A New Paradigm of Reality

Savior of humankind, enlighten our confused and
beleaguered society with a vision of reality that 
will inspire and transform its citizens. Our traditional 
sectarian standards have been found wanting. The 
value-constructs of yesterday are outworn and 
threadbare. We hunger for a larger and more encompassing 
revelation of universe truth and spiritual insight.

May your Almighty and Supreme leavening power of growth 
give us the wisdom and courage to phase out obsolete 
and decadent folkways. We pray that your Spirit of Truth 
will illuminate our hearts and minds to
create new styles of living and reformed social 
institutions that more perfectly actualize your will 
and way.

Your partnership in our troubled society transforms its 
meaning and destiny.
We confidently place our lives and fortunes in your 
hands, knowing that the resources of a vast universe are
structured for the ultimate salvation and victorious 
ascendancy of your mortal creation.

We rejoice and praise you, Universe Father, for the 
triumph of this bitter sweet adventure on the planets 
of time and space! (55)

## Integrity

Thank you, Universal Father, for making me who I am.
Help me to accept myself with all of my imperfections.
Motivate me to grow toward your divine perfection.
May I turn from the weakness of ego aggrandizement 
to the strength of creative service.
I am repelled by the tender-mindedness that needs 
the approval of others at any cost.
I will not be manipulated by adulation and flattery!
Establish me on the solid rock of your Reality.
Root me in the fertile soil of your nurturance.
May I develop that Supreme spiritual tough 
mindedness which is grounded in truth and enacted 
in love.
Grant me the stamina to carry on your mission in the 
midst of troubles and difficulties without 
the encouragement of approval or success.

I serve with confidence and joy, for I know that your 
purposes are destined to victorious 
ascendancy and universe Supremacy! (131)
