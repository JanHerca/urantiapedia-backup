Universal Father, among your vast assemblage of 
celestial agencies and personalities, we 
acknowledge the Most Highs as the 
overcontrollers of our planetary progress.

We rejoice that they use the limitless resources 
of the cosmos to curb our misdirections and 
stimulate our growth.

May your Spirit of Truth guide us past the false 
security of militarism into the sure influences of 
social brotherhood establishing peace on earth.

Inspire intellectual and artistic cross-fertilization 
that we may discover the perennial values of 
true philosophy.

Stir us to courageous ethical awakening that 
goodness and righteousness may become the 
standard of the land.

Enlighten our political wisdom that we may select 
competent national leaders and public servants 
who work toward international cooperation 
and world government.

Give us spiritual insight and cosmic intuition to 
envision the eternal realities of your kingdom 
that we may be energized by living faith to 
bring spiritual pressure from above to shape 
our human destiny. (82)

> “Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force; spiritual victories can be won only by spiritual power. This injunction against the employment of material influences refers to psychic force as well as to physical force. Overpowering arguments and mental superiority are not to be employed to coerce men and women into the kingdom. Man's mind is not to be crushed by the mere weight of logic or overawed by shrewd eloquence. While emotion as a factor in human decisions cannot be wholly eliminated, it should not be directly appealed to in the teachings of those who would advance the cause of the kingdom. Make your appeals directly to the divine spirit that dwells within the minds of men.” (<a id="a65_701"></a>[UB 159:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_2))
