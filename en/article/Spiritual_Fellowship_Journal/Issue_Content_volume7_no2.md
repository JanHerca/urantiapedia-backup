## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_

A Journal Established to Promote Theological, Philosophical, and Polity Discussions Germane to An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

### Guiding Principles 

An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation Should: [^1] 

1. Be based on the Fatherhood of God and the brother-sisterhood of humankind.
2. Be the outgrowth of love.
3. Foster sentiment, satisfy emotions, and promote loyalty.
4. Facilitate spiritual progress through cosmic meanings, moral values, social development, and personal living.
5. Provide supreme goals of living that are both temporal and eternal.
6. Be based on the biologic, social, and religious significance of the family.
7. Symbolize the permanent in the midst of unceasing change.
8. Glorify that which respects and unifies the diversities of society.
9. Promote higher meanings, beautiful relationships, and the highest values.
10. Embody some masterful mystery and connote some worthful unattainable.
11. Be meaningful and serviceable to both the individual and the group.
12. Serve as the skeletal structure for dynamic personal experience.

### The Purpose of Religious Institutions is to:

1. Dramatize the loyalties of spiritual experience.
2. Magnify the lures of truth, beauty, and goodness — supreme values.
3. Enhance the service of unselfish fellowship.
4. Glorify the potentials of family life.
5. Promote religious education.
6. Provide wise counsel and spiritual guidance.
7. Furnish and promote group worship.
8. Encourage friendship, neighborhood welfare, and moral values.
9. Spread the gospel of eternal salvation.

### Religious Institutions Should Avoid Dangers, Such As:

1. Fixation of ritual and theology.
2. Developing vested interests and secular involvement.
3. Serving the institution instead of serving God and ministering to people.
4. Forming competitive sects and developing a “chosen people” attitude.
5. Developing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and false ideas of sacredness.
6. Venerating the past while ignoring present needs and timely spiritual interpretations.
7. Failing to hold the interest of youth and grow with the times.
8. Losing sight of spiritual ministry and the saving message of salvation.

### Central Objective

The central objective of a group of people interested in initiating a new religious organization based on the teachings of the Fifth Epochal Revelation should be to create a polity with maximum flexibility that would function with small groups or large congregations, utilize lay leadership and/or ordained clergy, have crosscultural adaptibility, and broad theological inclusiveness.

Such an institution would be “ a gathering of persons who have accepted a common purpose, and a common discipline to guide the pursuit of that purpose, to the end that each involved person reaches higher fulfillment as a person, through _serving and being served_ by the common venture, than would be achieved alone or in a less committed relationship.”[^2]

## Content

***Editorials***

- **Charting a New Course**
    The new mission of the Journal is to “Promote Theological, Philosophical, and Polity Discussions Germane to an Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Ephochal Revelation.”
- **A New Spiritual Paradigm Needed**
    Traditional Christianity is rooted in a prescientific, outdated culturalreligious orientation. Only a new paradigm of spiritual reality can bring a spiritual renaissance to the church and culture.
- **New Dimensions of Theology**
    The enlarged theological dimensions of _The Urantia Book_ are so extensive they will create a new theological-religious paradigm and a new period of cultural creativity.
- **On Theological Transitions**
    Spiritual growth is always difficult, _The Urantia Book_ will, in time, inspire a renaissance in religious institutions and spiritual growth in our post-modern society.

***Articles***

- **To Be Wise as Serpents, Harmless as Doves**
    Rebecca Kantor points out that as religious organizations evolve from the Fifth Epochal Revelation, they will face the same challenges and pitfalls of other religious institutions, and she shares some helpful insights on how to lessen these difficulties.
- **Our Major Responsiblity: Disseminating the Fifth Epochal Revelation**
    Forty years of interfacing with progressive Christian leaders has demonstrated that the spiritual paradigm transition to the Fifth Epochal Revelation is just too great for them to make. New religious groups must be brought into existence to serve as venues of this enlarged spiritual vision.
- **Ambiguities of _The Urantia Book_**
    Dr. Kenneth Glasziou points out that believing in the literal dictation theory regarding _The Urantia Book_ is just as erroneous as belief in the literal inspiration of the Bible by Christian fundamentalists. _Urantia Book_ readers should be wise enough not to make this mistake.

***Columns and Features***

- **Interface**: Arguing With Nicodemus
- **Book Review**: The Good Book
    Reclaiming the Church
- ***The Urantia Book and Spiritual Renewal***:
    My Acceptance of _The Urantia Book_
