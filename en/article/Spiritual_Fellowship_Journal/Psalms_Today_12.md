The subconscious mind speaks to us according to

our hungers and desires. All too often, our sensual 
needs and egocentric motives take precedence

and dictate their guidance to our plans.

When civil law or the social good block our

path, this scheming inner design justifies our 
premeditations.

Our selfish intentions are styled in respectable 
clothing. The thwarted ego assures us that we 
have our rights, that our indulgences are justified.

Your steadfast love, O Lord, does not abandon us

to this dark side of our nature; our lower urges are 
challenged by the integrity of your indwelling 
presence.

Your saving grace reaches us even in the 
midst of corruption and despair; our fragmented 
and imperfect lives are saved by your loving 
guidance.

You rescue us from the pitfalls, the addictions, 
and the evil lures which have captivated us; and 
you save us from ourselves.

How precious is your steadfast love, O God! 
We children of earth live by its warmth in deep 
confidence and unshakable security.

Your Spirit is our foundation of life; in your 
light we see the truths of eternity.

As we strive to live by these great truths of your 
kingdom, all other needful things become ours as 
well.

Indeed, your blessings are so abundant and so 
deeply satisfying, we feel an eternal debt of 
love which grows each day.

What an overflowing fellowship of love is 
bringing joy to our days and meaning to our 
destiny!
