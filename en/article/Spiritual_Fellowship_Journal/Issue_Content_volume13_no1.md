## About The Spiritual Fellowship 

### Our Mission Statement

The Spiritual Fellowship is a religious organization whose mission is to bring the spiritual teachings of the Urantia Papers to all people.

### Our Core Values

The Spiritual Fellowship is committed to motivating, empowering, and supporting all people in their growing relationship with God and encouraging loving service, forgiveness, and ministry among all of God's children. The Spiritual Fellowship believes the Urantia Papers present an expanded revelation of the Life and Teachings of Jesus and a fuller revelation of God and our relationship to God. While recognizing that any revelation is incomplete short of the attainment of God, our Universal Parent, The Spiritual Fellowship recognizes the value of a continuing study of the Urantia Papers and other spiritual sources for inspiration and guidance.

## Contents

- **Quantum Mysteries & the Urantia Papers — Part II**, ***Light, atomic structure, 860 and lore of the number 137***
	By Donald Briglia ... “In a sense, the electron's path may be thought of as being made up of 137 steps, each step being that size that the electron assumes as a particle in atomic interactions”.... “The number 137 is the sign of the electron. If it comes up, there is an electron involved, real, virtual or both.”
- **Unique Urantian Outreach**, ***A compilation***
	y Gary Dangerfield ... “I am writing this for the person who is in a special place in their ”Earthly Pilgrimage“... perhaps an uncomfortably vulnerable place... maybe a place with more questions than answers... a place where the easy solutions and old formulas are coming into serious question in your thinking. If you are not at such a juncture in your life, just lay this brochure aside..”
- **Personal and Global Peace**, ***Can Peace be the Holy Grail of so Many Legends and Quests?***
	By Anton Schmalz ... "What are we doing today to become increasingly peaceful individuals? What are we doing to prepare for an increasingly peaceful global humanity?”
- **Where are the Great Urantia Leaders and Teachers?**
	By Larry Watkins ... “it can be suggested that Urantians have simply been looking in the wrong places. Rather than creating leaders and teachers, qualified leaders and teachers already exist.”
- **Is this a Boring Movement? Or am I a Boring Old Urantian?**
	By Eric Cosh... “I next stopped attending study groups. For the most part, I stopped talking about _The Urantia Book_ to new friends and acquaintances. What was wrong? What was happening to me? How could I have been so involved with something as wonderful as the Urantian Revelation, and then just drop out?”
- **God's Orchestra**
	By Saskia Praamsma Raevouri... “Yet, if each individual in each race took the time to find his unique form of expression, to discover where he fits into the whole, the world would soon be making beautiful music.”
- **God within Our Daily Life and Our Eternity Adventure**
	By JoiLin Johnson... "I was dealing with the real possibility of losing my everything — my best friend — my beloved — so I was begging God to let me keep him! I knew I had to change that prayer.”
- **The Man Nobody Knows — Part II**, ***A Discovery of the Real Jesus***
	By Bruce Barton ... “He invited frail bewildered humanity to stand upright and look at God face to face! He called upon men to throw away fear, disregard the limitations of their mortality, and claim the Lord of Creation as Father.”

> “When the wind blows, you hear the rustle of the leaves, but you do not see the wind — whence it comes or whither it goesl — and so it is with everyone born of the spirit. With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit.” _The Urantia Papers_, <a id="a160_317"></a>[UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5)
