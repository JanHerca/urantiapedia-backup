_In the name of the triune God: The Universal Father, The Eternal Son, and The Infinite Spirit. Amen._

> “Of God, the most inescapable of all presences, the most real of all facts, the most living of all truths, the most loving of all friends, and the most divine of all values, we have the right to be the most certain of all universe experiences.” (<a id="a38_248"></a>[UB 102:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_10))

> “Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” (<a id="a40_121"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3))

> “Jesus was the perfectly unified human personality. And today, as in Galilee, he continues to unify mortal experience and to co-ordinate human endeavors. He unifies life, ennobles character, and simplifies experience. He enters the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it.” (<a id="a42_290"></a>[UB 100:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_18))

> Said Jesus, “I have come into the world to put love in the place of fear, joy in the place of sorrow, confidence in the place of dread, loving service and appreciative worship in the place of slavish bondage and meaningless ceremonies.” (<a id="a44_240"></a>[UB 149:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p6_5))

In establishing a meaningful relationship in the Remembrance Supper, Jesus used symbols of wine and bread to suggest a living and personal communion with his Spirit of Truth. He sought to set our reborn souls “free upon the joyous wings of a new and living spiritual liberty.” We need no theological interpretations of his divine presence “for on all such occasions the Master is _really present_.”

On this night of his betrayal, Jesus took the cup in his hands and blessed it, saying: "Take this cup, all of you, and drink of it. This shall be the cup of my remembrance. This is the cup of the blessing of a new dispensation of grace and truth. This shall be to you the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth.” (<a id="a48_341"></a>[UB 179:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_1))

And in like manner, after they had partaken of the cup of remembrance, the Master took bread, and after giving thanks, broke it in pieces and directed them to pass it around, saying, “Take this bread of remembrance and eat it. I have told you that I am the bread of life. And this bread of life is the united life of the Father and the Son in one gift. The word of the Father, as revealed in the Son, is indeed the bread of life.” (<a id="a50_432"></a>[UB 179:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_3))

> “And as often as you do this, do it in remembrance of me. And when you do remember me, first look back upon my life in the flesh, recall that I was once with you, and then, by faith, discern that you shall all some time sup with me in the Father's eternal kingdom. This is the new Passover which I leave with you, even the memory of my bestowal life, the word of eternal truth; and of my love for you, the outpouring of my Spirit of Truth upon all flesh.” (<a id="a52_459"></a>[UB 179:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_9))

## Invitation

You, then, who sincerely desire to acknowledge the love of the Universal Father and the sovereignty of his Son, Christ Michael, in your life, unite with me now as we consecrate ourselves to the guidance of his Spirit of Truth, and dedicate ourselves in his service.

### Let us Pray

Our perfect, righteous, and loving heavenly Father, we desire to give ourselves fully unto you, and to your Son, Christ Jesus.

Guide and direct us on our life's journey. Sanctify our steps and co-ordinate our thoughts. Ever lead us in the ways of eternal progress. Fill us with wisdom to the fullness of power, and vitalize us with your infinite energy. Inspire us with the consciousness of your ever present spiritual guidance and ministry. Guide us ever upward in the pathway of light. Make us like yourself in eternal glory, and receive us into your endless service on high. Amen. (<a id="a62_458"></a>[UB 144:5.28-37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_28), adapted)

> “Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am true and loyal, and you shall find spiritual rest for your souls.” (<a id="a64_195"></a>[UB 163:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_7))

_The minister after uncovering the elements, may lift up the cup saying,_

The cup of blessing which we celebrate, is Christ Michael's designated emblem of his spiritual presence with us through the Spirit of Truth.

_As the ushers are passing the cup of blessing, the minister may read selectively from the following passages, stopping when the ushers return:_

> I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. I am the vine, and you are the branches. Every branch coming out of me which bears no fruit, the Father will take away. Every branch which bears fruit, the Father will cleanse that it may bear more fruit. You must abide in me, and I in you; the branch will die if it is separated from the vine. As the branch cannot bear fruit except it abides in the vine, so neither can you yield the fruits of loving service except you abide in me. Remember: I am the real vine, and you are the living branches. He who lives in me, and I in them, will bear much fruit of the spirit and experience the supreme joy of yielding this spiritual harvest. If you will maintain this living spiritual connection with me, you will bear abundant fruit. If you abide in me and my words live in you, you will be able to commune freely with me, and then can my living spirit so infuse you that you may ask whatsoever my spirit wills and do all this with the assurance that the Father will grant us our petition. Herein is the Father glorified: that the vine has many living branches, and that every branch bears much fruit. (<a id="a72_1152"></a>[UB 180:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_1), adapted)

> You well know the commandment which directs you that you love one another; that you love your neighbor even as yourself. But I am not wholly satisfied with even that sincere devotion on the part of my children. I would have you perform still greater acts of love in the Father's family. And so I give you this new commandment: That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all people know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another. (<a id="a74_471"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1), adapted)

> When I invite you to love one another, even as I have loved you, I hold up before you the supreme measure of true affection, for greater love can no person have than this: that they will lay down their life for their friends. And you are my friends; you will continue to be my friends if you are but willing to do what I have taught you. You have called me Master, but I do not call you servants. If you will only love one another as I am loving you, you shall be my friends, and I will ever speak to you of that which the Father reveals to me. (<a id="a76_548"></a>[UB 180:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_3), adapted)

> Love men and women, as I have loved you. Serve your fellow mortals, even as I have served you. My love overshadows you, my spirit dwells with you, my peace abides upon you. I will go with you into the world. I am with you always. (<a id="a78_233"></a>[UB 193:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_2), <a id="a78_278"></a>[UB 193:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_5), adapted)

_When the ushers have returned, the minister raising the cup, may say:_

Take and drink this cup of blessing. For our Sovereign is, indeed, the cup of love residing with us through the Spirit of Truth.

_The minister lifting and breaking the loaf of bread, may say,_

This bread of remembrance which we consecrate, is Christ Michael's designated emblem of his bestowal life among us as the true and living Bread of Life.

As the ushers are passing the bread, the minister may read selectively from the following passages, stopping when the ushers return.

> I have come to proclaim spiritual liberty, teach eternal truth, and foster living faith. My Father now stands ready to give you the true bread of life. The bread of heaven is that which comes down from God and gives eternal life to the people of the world. And when you say to me, Give us this living bread, I will answer: I am this bread of life. He who comes to me shall not hunger, while he who believes me shall never thirst. (<a id="a90_433"></a>[UB 153:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p2_6), adapted)

> “I am this bread of life. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead. But this bread which comes down from God, if a man eats thereof, he shall never die in spirit. I repeat, I am this living bread, and every soul who attains the realization of this united nature of God and man shall live forever. And this bread of life which I give to all who will receive is my own living and combined nature. The Father in the Son and the Son one with the Father-that is my life-giving revelation to the world and my saving gift to all nations.” (<a id="a92_548"></a>[UB 153:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p2_12))

> “The true shepherd gathers his flock into the fold for the night in times of danger. And when the morning has come, he enters into the fold by the door, and when he calls, the sheep know his voice. Every shepherd who gains entrance to the sheepfold by any other means than by the door is a thief and a robber. The true shepherd enters the fold after the porter has opened the door for him, and his sheep, knowing his voice, come out at his word; and when they that are his are thus brought forth, the true shepherd goes before them; he leads the way and the sheep follow him. His sheep follow him because they know his voice; they will not follow a stranger.” (<a id="a94_663"></a>[UB 165:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_4))

> I am both the door to the Father's sheepfold and at the same time the true shepherd of my Father's flocks. I am the true shepherd who is willing to lay down his life for the sheep. The thief breaks into the fold only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; but I have come that you all may have life and have it more abundantly. He who is a hireling, when danger arises, will flee and allow the sheep to be scattered and destroyed; but the true shepherd will not flee when the wolf comes; he will protect his flock and, if necessary, lay down his life for his sheep. Verily, verily, I say to you, friends and enemies, I am the true shepherd; I know my own and my own know me. I will not flee in the face of danger. I will finish this service of the completion of my Father's will, and I will not forsake the flock which the Father has intrusted to my keeping. (<a id="a96_862"></a>[UB 165:2.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_7), adapted)

When Jesus had finished his earth life, the name of the Father had been so revealed that the Master could truly say:

> I am the bread of life.
> 
> I am the living water.
> 
> I am the light of the world.
> 
> I am the true vine; you are the branches.
> 
> I am the good shepherd.
> 
> I am the infinite Father of my finite children.
> 
> I am the way, the truth, and the life.
> 
> I am the open door to eternal salvation.
> 
> I am the living link between time and eternity. (<a id="a116_51"></a>[UB 182:1.10-25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_10), adapted)

_When the ushers have returned, the minister raising the bread, may say:_

Take and eat this bread of remembrance. For our Lord is, indeed, the true Bread of Life.

Now may this communion with our Creator and Savior, who is the Cup of Love and the Bread of Life, keep and preserve us in body, mind, soul, and spirit unto eternal life. Amen.

_Let us enter prayerful thanksgiving._

Bountiful and loving Universe Father, we rejoice that you have established a memorial of your saving bestowal ministry on our world. We thank you for refreshing and restoring us through your living presence and loving fellowship in this Remembrance Communion with your Spirit of Truth. Keep us in your constant care, strengthen our faith in the transcendence of spiritual growth in our lives, and increase our love for one another as we go forth in service in the world.

We live in the power of your love, and praise your universe sovereignty for ever and ever. Amen.

> “The dangers of formalized religion are: fixation of beliefs and crystallization of sentiments; accumulation of vested interests with increase of secularization; tendency to standardize and fossilize truth; diversion of religion from the service of God to the service of the church; inclination of leaders to become administrators instead of ministers; tendency to form sects and competitive divisions; establishment of oppressive ecclesiastical authority; creation of the aristocratic 'chosen people' attitude; fostering of false and exaggerated ideas of sacredness; the routinizing of religion and the petrification of worship; tendency to venerate the past while ignoring present demands; failure to make up-to-date interpretations of religion; entanglement with functions of secular institutions; it creates the evil discrimination of religious castes; it becomes an intolerant judge of orthodoxy; it fails to hold the interest of adventurous youth and gradually loses the saving message of the gospel of eternal salvation.” <a id="a133_1031"></a>[UB 99:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_3)
