_The psalms of yesterday, as beautiful and moving as they are, often reflect egocentric or provincial attitudes._

_Our society hungers for spiritually mature expressions of praise to God and a universal appreciation of truth, beauty, and goodness. These contemporary psalms may be inspired by a traditional psalm or may be independent creations. We believe these psalms should be an expression of the human spirit and. therefore, may or may not carry the names of their authors. They may also be submitted under a pseudonym. In time, we hope to publish a book of Psalms Today. Please send us your contributions to this collection._

## A Creation Litany

O God, your praise is the litany of all creation.
You have clothed the earth with a rich profusion of microcosmic undergarments and dressed its appealing contours of mountains and valleys with innumerable vestments of usefulness and beauty.
You have crowned the skies with countless jewels of infinity which inspire awe.
The mighty chorus of humanity shakes the earth and fills the heavens with your praise and adoration.

You, Primal Father, have designed the entire universe as birth place and training ground for your mortal children.
You have fashioned our minds and personalities to reflect your truth and love.
You have chosen us as your sons and daughters and given us freedom to accept or reject your loving guidance.
For those who so choose, nothing in all the universe can prevent our coming to your Paradise abode.

Gracious Father, you understand our finitude, our animalistic tendencies, and our lack of spiritual courage.
Our imperfection leads us into evil and our self-will into sin.
Our waywardness and misdeeds detour us into the valley of depression, guilt, and loneliness.
We live with a sense of inferiority, self-rejection, and fear.
We strike out in defensiveness and anger, stumbling toward the pit of despair.

In this dark night of the soul, you abide with us in infinite patience, understanding, and mercy.
You reach out to us in never ceasing love.
Nothing we do can remove us from your parental affection and concern.
Always do you hold out the vision of a better way and a new beginning.

Through suffering and enlightenment we are opened to your saving hope and empowered to choose the way to life and salvation.
Our motives are transparent in your sight.
We are not changed by half-hearted wishes coming from the top of our mind; but by whole-hearted decisions originating in the depth of our soul.

The moment we turn from our error and sincerely desire to follow your will, our forgiveness is complete.
You see us in our true spirit potential, facing your light and your truth, becoming new people in your kingdom.
Our spiritual liberation is replete; our gratitude is allconsuming; our joy is overflowing.

O God and Father of us all, your praise is the litany of all creation.
A mighty chorus of humanity shakes the earth and fills the heavens with anthems of your praise and glory!
