I aspire, Universal Father, to new expressions of 
spiritual service indigenous to the unique
personality you have given me.

I long to achieve the nobility of character which 
feeds the wellsprings of creativity.

Deliver me from the foibles of spiritual immaturity:
Pining for optimum conditions rather than
joyously accepting the rigorous living required 
by evolutionary experience;

Pleading that you solve problems that I should 
courageously grapple with myself; and,

Equating my circumscribed world with your 
larger vision.

Enlarge my appreciation of your endless Paradise 
resources mediated to us through the Supreme 
ministry of our Universe Sovereign.

I am enriched and invigorated by your presence 
and partnership in service and soul actualization.

I rejoice in the potentials of your high calling.
Keep me ever constant, steadfast, and sensitively 
tuned to your truth, beauty, and goodness!
