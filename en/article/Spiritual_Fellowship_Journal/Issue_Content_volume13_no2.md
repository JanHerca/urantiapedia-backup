## About The Spiritual Fellowship 

### Our Mission Statement

The Spiritual Fellowship is a religious organization whose mission is to bring the spiritual teachings of the Urantia Papers to all people.

### Our Core Values

The Spiritual Fellowship is committed to motivating, empowering, and supporting all people in their growing relationship with God and encouraging loving service, forgiveness, and ministry among all of God's children. The Spiritual Fellowship believes the Urantia Papers present an expanded revelation of the Life and Teachings of Jesus and a fuller revelation of God and our relationship to God. While recognizing that any revelation is incomplete short of the attainment of God, our Universal Parent, The Spiritual Fellowship recognizes the value of a continuing study of the Urantia Papers and other spiritual sources for inspiration and guidance.

## Contents

- **Sir Hubert Wilkins**
	By Robert D. Campbell ... “In fact, if you consider the story of this remarkable man you may recognize that for him to be a part of the miraculous events unfolding in Chicago that resulted in the Urantia Papers, was really just another episode in a life replete with adventure.”
- **Eugenics and the Urantia Papers — Land Mines**
	By Dick Bain ... “In an atmosphere like this, should we defend the eugenics in the Urantia Papers? I am sure that we will have to deal with much criticism of the eugenics stand of the authors. Unfortunately, eugenics concepts are found in many of the papers.”
- **Eugenics and the Urantia Papers — A Different View**
	By Larry and Joan Mullins... “... the Urantia Papers do not advocate the development of a 'super race,' in fact, they strongly urge us to foster the 'average' man. They tell us that from the ranks of normal, average people come the mutant geniuses of the race. This revelatory information is diametrically counter to the defamed eugenics idea of fostering race superiority from supposed elite pedigrees."
- **Spiritual Outreach for Spiritual Fellowships**, _Bringing the Teachings of the Urantia Papers to All the People_
	By Nancy Long ... “We are looking for such seekers of spiritual truth. We have a need — a need for balanced, solid, resourceful, creative, persistent, unwavering souls who are called to venture into this important ministry establishing spiritual groups and fellowships. This type of ministry is not for timid souls.”
- **God and Lady**
	By Thomas Strawser ... “My free will choice works with God the way it worked with my mare. I have to let go of the reins and give Him the freedom and permission to do His part in my life. He won't just take control. He doesn't try to take the reins away from me either, but only participates in my life as much as I let Him.”
- **The Man Nobody Knows — Part III**, _A Discovery of the Real Jesus_
	By Bruce Barton ... “For if human life has any significance it is thisthat God has set going here an experiment to which all His resources are committed. ... No single kind of human talent or effort can be spared if the experiment is to succeed. ...Thus all business is his Father's business. All work is worship; all useful service, prayer. And whoever works wholeheartedly at any worthy calling is a co-worker with the Almighty in the great enterprise which He has initiated but which He can never finish without the help of men.”

> “When the wind blows, you hear the rustle of the leaves, but you do not see the wind — whence it comes or whither it goesl — and so it is with everyone born of the spirit. With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit.” _The Urantia Papers_, <a id="a152_317"></a>[UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5)
