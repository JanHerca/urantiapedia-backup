Blessed are those who achieve God-consciousness, for they are able to see the spirit dimension of Reality.

They have entered the fathomless depths of endless empowerment.

They are at home in an expanding universe where

hey are never alone.

They know they are in partnership with an all-wise and loving Guide and Director.

A new world of perception is opening.

The refreshing fragrance of kindness is enriching human relationships.

The joyful music of love is transforming attitudes and actions.

The captivating beauty of the commonplace is

transfiguring the world about us.

An enlarged vision of truth is expanding the hor zons of our poetneial.

A deepening knowledge of the Supreme gives us unshakable assurance

as earthly securities crumble. (128)
