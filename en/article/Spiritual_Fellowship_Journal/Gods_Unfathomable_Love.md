O Lord of all, how majestic and revered is your 
name in all the cosmos.

Father of Fathers, whose glory is proclaimed from 
the mortal worlds to Paradise, you are the First 
Source and Center of all things and beings. 

How marvelous it is that you govern the universe 
of universes by the compelling power of your love!

When I look at the astronomical systems and 
constellations and contemplate the endless 
galaxies which you have established, we are 
but mites in the universe.

Yet you have made us your cherished children! 

How can I understand your unfathomable love 
which has a supreme concern for us mortals?

Indeed, you have bestowed yourself upon us, given 
each of us a Divine Monitor which endows us 
with endless possibilities for spiritual growth! 

In this precious gift you have crowned us with 
glory and honor.

Paradise Father, you have made us stewards over 
the affairs and resources of this planet; provide us 
also with the wisdom necessary to co-operate 
with your forces of creative evolution.

Lead our lowly planet, step by step, to that great 
era of Light and Life when the kingdoms of this 
world shall truly become the kingdoms of 
the Most High.

O Lord our God, how infinite is your wisdom in the 
plan for all creation!

How majestic and glorious is your name in all the 
universe!
