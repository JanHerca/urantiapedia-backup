## The Cleaning Lady

I'm a professional woman who usually works late at the office. Much as most any woman, in the back of my mind I am always, on some level, conscious of my physical safety. In the evening a black woman cleans our offices after work. At first she made me very uncomfortable. I thought there was something mentally wrong with her. She is large, has huge teeth and is missing a few, her back is curved and she's always rubbing her face as if she's exhausted. I greet her every time I see her. The other evening she was in the lunch room with her head on the table. I spoke to her but she was so tired she couldn't lift her head.

The next night she was much better. I asked her if she worked more than one job. Yes, she said. I asked her if she got a nap today because she looked like she felt better. Yes, she said. And I told her I was happy she was able to get some rest. Then she told me about her other job. She packs lunches for the less fortunate! Understand that this woman is poor, she wears tattered clothing, she is not educated. Yet, she's an angel to people less fortunate than her!

The next night I gave her some cucumbers from the garden and she was so excited. She told me all about the salad she was going to make. By this simple action I connected with her on a new level. The consciousness of separation and discomfort I had was dispelled, and replaced by something differentsomething precious.

I now have some idea of how the Master did not measure people by some code of status — in fact-he did not measure them at all. He could “see” all people as his brothers and sisters: “The Master looked upon men as the sons of God and foresaw a magnificent and eternal future for those who chose survival. He was not a moral skeptic; he viewed man positively, not negatively. He saw most men as weak rather than wicked, more distraught than depraved. But no matter what their status, they were all God's children and his brethren.” <a id="a44_530"></a>[[UB 196:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_9)]

S.C.C.

> “Jesus was never in a hurry. He had time to comfort his fellow men ‘as he passed by.’ And he always made his friends feel at ease. He was a charming listener. He never engaged in the meddlesome probing of the souls of his associates.” <a id="a48_237"></a>[[UB 171:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_5)]

> “Most of the really important things which Jesus said or did seemed to happen casually, ‘as he passed by.’ There was so little of the professional, the wellplanned, or the premeditated in the Master's earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, ‘He went about doing good.’” <a id="a50_372"></a>[[UB 171:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_9)]
