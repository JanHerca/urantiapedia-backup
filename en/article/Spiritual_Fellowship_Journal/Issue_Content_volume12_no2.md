## About The Spiritual Fellowship 

### Our Mission Statement

The Spiritual Fellowship is a religious organization whose mission is to bring the spiritual teachings of the Urantia Papers to all people.

### Our Core Values

The Spiritual Fellowship is committed to motivating, empowering, and supporting all people in their growing relationship with God and encouraging loving service, forgiveness, and ministry among all of God's children. The Spiritual Fellowship believes the Urantia Papers present an expanded revelation of the Life and Teachings of Jesus and a fuller revelation of God and our relationship to God. While recognizing that any revelation is incomplete short of the attainment of God, our Universal Parent, The Spiritual Fellowship recognizes the value of a continuing study of the Urantia Papers and other spiritual sources for inspiration and guidance.

## Contents

- **The History of the Spiritual Fellowship**
	By Dr. Meredith J. Sprunger ... “Dr. Sadler and I used to discuss the probable nature of religious organizations inspired by the Fifth Epochal Revelation. We observed that the authors of the Urantia Papers talked about the need for a new religious organization.”
- **Quantum Mysteries & the Urantia Papers**, ***Light, atomic structure, 860 and lore of the number 137***
	By Donald Briglia ... “It's one of the greatest $d-n$ mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the ‘hand of God’ wrote that number, and ‘we don't know how He pushed his pencil.’,” Richard Feynman
- **A Service Adventure in Guatemala**, ***A Bold New Generation of Urantians Emerges***
	By Micah Kruger ... “A generation ago, the Vietnam War was a great challenge for men my age. Now, in my generation, young men and women have the opportunity to choose their future. In considering the Peace Corps, I was reminded of Jesus'journeys as Ganid's tutor. During that time, Jesus was able to observe how people of different cultures lived, and through his observations he came to understand more thoroughly the minds of men.”
- **Let's Go Public**
	By Ken Raveill ... “_The Urantia Book_ Home Study Group has been and remains the basic method for attracting new readers while offering an opportunity for rich fellowship and spiritual growth ... I was surprised to find several opportunities in Independence for our _Urantia Book_ Study Group to meet in a public location ... However, the real break in our search came when two members of our study group, Linda and Bob Keller, who were buying books at Barnes & Noble bookstore, asked if it was possible for a book study group to meet there once a week.”
- **Compare**, ***Human Concepts Paralleled with Statements from the Urantia Papers***
	By Tom and Karen Allen ... Tom and Karen Allen of Oklahoma City began last year to collect conceptual parallels and send them out via email to Urantians. Here is a small sampling of some of their discoveries.
- **Our Urantian in Pakistan**, ***Excerpts of Nadia's Letters to J.J. Johnson***
	“... I was thirsty for truth and there was no charm in my life, it was empty and was bored but you introduced me this true Epochal Revelation and its changed my life. When my heavenly father felt mercy on me and send this Treasure for me so I am sharing the Heavenly father s love with all my spiritual sisters and brothers on this planet... JJ, when sometimes I am writing e-mails to you or reading the UB, I am having tears in my eyes that how fortunate I am that I have something special with me and how much I am thankful to you that you shared with me.”
- **The Man Nobody Knows**, ***A Discovery of the Real Jesus***
	By Bruce Barton ... “He picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered the world. When the man had finished his reading, he exclaimed, 'This is a man nobody knows.'”,

> “When the wind blows, you hear the rustle of the leaves, but you do not see the wind — whence it comes or whither it goesl — and so it is with everyone born of the spirit. With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit.” _The Urantia Papers_, <a id="a153_317"></a>[UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5)
