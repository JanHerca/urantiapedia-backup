How long, O Lord, must we wait for the enlightenment of humanity?

How long will we be afraid to turn our face toward truth?

How long must I bear this anguish of soul, struggling with closed minds and stunted souls?

How long will your people be led by the priests of the past instead of the prophets of the future?

Give me the patience to co-operate with your laws of creative evolution.

Deliver me from the folly of devising shortcuts to sound spiritual growth.

May I not indulge in the short-lived joys experienced by the midwife of the premature.

Rather, O Lord, give me the joys of those who stand alone on the mountain top.

Give me the satisfactions of those pioneers who break new trails knowing that others will follow, settle, and build.

May all the lone voices of truth crying in the wilderness become a chorus of humanity affirming your will and way.

I have complete trust in the triumph of your great plan for humankind. Your steadfast love and Fatherly care are present at every step of the way.

In the midst of the problems and suffering of my life, I live in the bountiful blessings of renewal, growth, and inner peace you provide me.

I will praise you eternally! (13)
