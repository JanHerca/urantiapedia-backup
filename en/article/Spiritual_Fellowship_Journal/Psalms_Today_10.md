Happy are those who follow the counsel of wisdom, 
and live by the leading of the Spirit, 
who find their identity as sons and daughters of the Most High, 
and delight in universe laws and the love of the Creator.

The divine experiential plan and educational purpose 
for their life gives meaning and joy to all that they do.

They are like a tree growing by a sparkling stream. 
Its leaves do not wither in the heat of summer and it bears good fruit in season. 
They are resourceful, courageous, and service oriented.

The self-centered, the pleassure seekers, 
and the evil doers are not so, 
but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 
They will not withstand the supreme test of experience. 
Their inner self is barren and empty; 
in mid-life they are burned out and desolate.

The eternal cosmic order undergirds the righteous;
but the ego-centric and the ungodly shall perish.
