## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_

A Journal Established to Promote Theological, Philosophical, and Polity Discussions Germane to An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

### Guiding Principles

An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation Should: [^1]

1. Be based on the Fatherhood of God and the brother-sisterhood of humankind.
2. Be the outgrowth of love.
3. Foster sentiment, satisfy emotions, and promote loyalty.
4. Facilitate spiritual progress through cosmic meanings, moral values, social development, and personal living.
5. Provide supreme goals of living that are both temporal and eternal.
6. Be based on the biologic, social, and religious significance of the family.
7. Symbolize the permanent in the midst of unceasing change.
8. Glorify that which respects and unifies the diversities of society.
9. Promote higher meanings, beautiful relationships, and the highest values.
10. Embody some masterful mystery and connote some worthful unattainable.
11. Be meaningful and serviceable to both the individual and the group.
12. Serve as the skeletal structure for dynamic personal experience.

### The Purpose of Religious Institutions is to:

1. Dramatize the loyalties of spiritual experience.
2. Magnify the lures of truth, beauty, and goodness — supreme values.
3. Enhance the service of unselfish fellowship.
4. Glorify the potentials of family life.
5. Promote religious education.
6. Provide wise counsel and spiritual guidance.
7. Furnish and promote group worship.
8. Encourage friendship, neighborhood welfare, and moral values.
9. Spread the gospel of eternal salvation.

### Religious Institutions Should Avoid Dangers, Such As:

1. Fixation of ritual and theology.
2. Developing vested interests and secular involvement.
3. Serving the institution instead of serving God and ministering to people.
4. Forming competitive sects and developing a “chosen people” attitude.
5. Developing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and false ideas of sacredness.
6. Venerating the past while ignoring present needs and timely spiritual interpretations.
7. Failing to hold the interest of youth and grow with the times.
8. Losing sight of spiritual ministry and the saving message of salvation.

## Central Objective

The central objective of a group of people interested in initiating a new religious organization based on the teachings of the Fifth Epochal Revelation should be to create a polity with maximum flexibility that would function with small groups or large congregations, utilize lay leadership and/or ordained clergy, have crosscultural adaptibility, and broad theological inclusiveness.

Such an institution would be “ a gathering of persons who have accepted a common purpose, and a common discipline to guide the pursuit of that purpose, to the end that each involved person reaches higher fulfillment as a person, through serving and being served by the common venture, than would be achieved alone or in a less committed relationship.” [^2]

## Content

***Editorials***

- **On Copyright and Service Marks.**
	There is a sharp divergence of opinion on the use of copyright and service marks associated with _The Urantia Book_. I have refrained from expressing my opinion on these issues. It may be time to state my view.
- **Ecumenically Challenged**
	Leaders of the National Council of Churches are thinking about forming a new, more inclusive ecumenical organization. Students of _The Urantia Book_ are also challenged.
- **How is Society Enculturated?**
	Probably the major concern of dedicated students of the Urantia Papers is how to effectively share the spiritual enlightenment and supernal wisdom of the Fifth Epochal Revelation with the people of the world. In short, what is the most effective method of enculturating the world with the enlarged spiritual vision of _The Urantia Book_?

***Articles***

- **The State of the Urantia Movement**
	The Urantia community is at a crossroads. Our major organizations are facing the choice of reform or failure.
- **Goals Not Creeds — Worship and Service**
	Rosey Lieske says that her purely religious experience is seeming to veer from the trajectory of the movement as a whole.
- **The Mythology of _The Urantia Book_**
	_The Urantia Book_ provides a mythology to live by that gives satisfying answers to many of our questions about life here and hereafter.
- **Planetary Ecumenism**
	Our planet is in a state of emergency. The threat is quite genuine and is causing spiritual transformation.
- **Revelation and Patience**
	Overteaching and over enlightenment often results in confusion and dismay, and tend to rob the recipients of what enlightenment they do possess.
