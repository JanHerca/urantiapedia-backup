_by Madeline Noordzy, Perth_

The last four words in Connie Lester's letter to the September/October 1991 issue of Six-O-Six, “...to make fair evaluations.” prompted me to study _The URANTIA Book_ a little more in regards to the claims made by Gabriel of Sedona as to ‘repersonalizations.’ says:

On UB 114:7.13 a mysterious paragraph in brackets

> “_(The cosmic reserve corps of universe-conscious citizens on Urantia now numbers over one thousand mortals whose insight of cosmic citizenship far transcends the sphere of their terrestrial abode, but I am forbidden to reveal the real nature of the function of this unique group of living human beings.)_” <a id="a42_309"></a>[UB 114:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_13)

On UB 55:3.11, _The URANTIA Book_ tells us:

“_When a settled world progresses beyond the third stage of light and life, all ascenders are destined, before attaining the minor sector, to receive some sort of transient assignment on a planet passing through the earlier stages of evolution._” <a id="a46_247"></a>[UB 55:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p3_11)

I am asking myself now whether this cosmic reserve corps are ascenders from other worlds who are on a “transient assignment” here on Urantia because they put their hands up when volunteers were needed to help advance this backward planet during this renaissance of spiritual awakening. They would not be ‘chosen ones’, they volunteered. There is a difference!

Sananda's claim that Machiventa appears through his light body does not seem so strange to me when I read on UB 50:2.7:

> “_...the Melchizedeks can and do make themselves visible to the inhabitants of the evolutionary worlds._” <a id="a52_108"></a>[UB 50:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_7)

Especially it does not seem strange when on UB 93:10.6, I read:

> “_Recent rulings handed down from the Most Highs of Edentia, and later confirmed by the Ancients of Days of Uversa, strongly suggest that this bestowal Melchizedek is destined to take the place of the fallen Planetary Prince, Caligastia. If our conjectures in this respect are correct, it is altogether possible that Machiventa Melchizedek may again appear in person on Urantia and in some modified manner resume the role of the dethroned Planetary Prince, or else appear on earth to function as vicegerent Planetary Prince representing Christ Michael, who now actually holds the title of Planetary Prince of Urantia. While it is farfrom clear to us as to what Machiventa's destinymaybe, nevertheless, events which have so recently taken place strongly suggest that the foregoing conjectures are probably not far from the truth._” <a id="a56_833"></a>[UB 93:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_6)

On UB 114:1.4, The Chief of Seraphim stationed on Urantia, writes:

> “Still others, including this narrator, look for Melchizedek's appearance any day or hour.” <a id="a60_94"></a>[UB 114:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_4)

This was of course written in the first half of this century.

The people of Sedona claim that this has in fact happened.

In Paper 50 on “The Planetary Princes”, the book mentions on UB 50:2.4:

> “_The entire staff of a world ruler consists of personalities of the Infinite Spinit and certain types of higher evolved beings and ascending mortals from other worlds (emphasis mine). Such a staff averages about one thousand, and as the planet progresses, this corps of helpers may be increased up to one hundred thousand or more._” <a id="a68_336"></a>[UB 50:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_4)

Urantia being the unique planet it is, could this be the cosmic reserve corps of destiny?

On UB 50:4.9 we are being told:

> “_A Planetary Prince is not visible to mortal beings: it is a test of faith (emphasis mine) to believe the representations of the semimaterial beings of his staff._” <a id="a74_168"></a>[UB 50:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_9)

On UB 50:7.1, when speaking of agondonters, the book says:

> “_We have discovered that such ascenders are very early intrusted with numerous special assignments to cosmic undertakings (emphasis mine) where unquestioned faith and sublime confidence are essential to achievement._” <a id="a78_221"></a>[UB 50:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_1)

Is it not possible that Sananda, White Cloud, Gabriel and Niann have had previous experiences as agondonters on special assignments?

Could it not be that Gabriel of Sedona is the material complement of Gabriel of Salvington when _The URANTIA Book_, when discussing self-acting adjusters, tells us that

> “_a self-acting Adjuster is one who has served in a time of crisis in the expereince of some human being who was the material complement (emphasis mine) of a spirit personality intrusted with the enactment of some cosmic achievement essential to the spiritual economy of the planet._” (<a id="a84_288"></a>[UB 109:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_7))

I feel it is important not to become too dogmatic about _The URANTIA Book_ and perhaps have a look at this ‘repersonalization’ from another angle.

Jesus always taught us that love is the key to everything and when looking for the motives of someone else's behaviour, not first to look for the worst one, that of material gain and self-aggrandizement, but trust that the God within that person is guiding him or her to give service — and maybe a very high one — to his or her fellow. men.

When all is said and done, how many of us have really checked this out for ourselves? Has Connie ever met these people in Sedona?

Somebody once wrote:

“What would happen, If everybody said, ‘What would happen?’ And nobody went, To take a look, At what would happen, If something happened.”

To the people who prefer to watch on the cosmic fence and say “What if?”, _The URANTIA Book_ has this to say:

> “_Universe difficulties must be met and planetary obstacles must be encountered as a part of the experience training provided for the growth and development, the progressive perfection, of the evolving souls of mortal creatures. The spiritualization of the human soul requires intimate experience with the educational solving of a wide range of real universe problems. The animal nature and the lower forms of will creatures do not progress favorably in environmental ease. Problematic situations, coupled with exertion stimuli, conspire to produce those activities of mind, soul, and spirit which contribute mightily to the achievement of worthy goals of mortal progression and to the attainment of higher levels of spirit destiny._” (<a id="a98_738"></a>[UB 154:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_5))

If there are over one thousand in the cosmic reserve corps, I wonder if most of them have a bit of trouble waking up and remembering why they are here at this time.

> Jesus Always Taught Us That Love Is The Key To Everything...

After reading Transmission S, the title of which is “Delusion Energy Frequencies, Distortion Waves and Distortion Sound Waves in Relationship to the Adjudication of Urantia, Implemented by Machiventa Melchizedek, present Planetary Prince of Urantia” and another communication called “Concerning Earth Changes”, which were recently sent to me from Sedona and which sound like a warning from Machiventa himself to the sometimes smug Urantia movement, it seems to me that the earth changes described are self-evident. We can see them happening all around us, not only in the planet, but to its inhabitants as well. But most people do not know the real reason behind it all.

Schopenhauer once wrote:

“Before a problem achieves recognition as a such it has to go through three stages. In the first one it is laughed at, during the second it will be fought against until, in the third, it is accepted as being self evident.”

I feel we are entering the third stage.
