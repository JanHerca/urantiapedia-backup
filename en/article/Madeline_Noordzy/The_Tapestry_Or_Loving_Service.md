Why did we give the conference theme this name? In a tapestry there are many different colours; There are light and dark colours, warm and cool colours, colours for shading and colours for highlighting. All these are necessary if we are to achieve a harmonious whole. For was it not for the shading in the background, how could the highlight stand out against the rest?

Similarly in a group of people, there are many different personalities. They give the colour to the group. But sometimes it is difficult to blend different personalities into a harmonious working unit.

I think all of us have the secret ambition to fuse with our Thought Adjuster one day. But what does fusion really mean? As far as I can see, it means that two entities, one pre-personal and the other one personal, become as one. They have taken on each other's identity. You can't tell them apart anymore. That's what we are aiming for. To identify ourselves with our Thought Adjuster.

I realize, that we are still a long, long way off from that point in our universe career, but let us assume for a moment that we were well on our way. By that time our Adjuster would be firmly in control of our thoughts. This fragment of the Universal Father Is LOVE, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE:

If we saw things through the eyes of our Divine Monitor, would we then say to our friend: “I am only going to love you and co-operate with you if you are nice to me and if you agree with me. If you have a different opinion. I an going to get very upset and maybe even angry”.

Of course not: Our Thought Adjuster is incapable of anger or intolerance. He is incapable of impatience. He is non-judgmental and does not criticize. He loves our friend, whatever the cost, through thick and thin, in sickness and in health, even when he becomes hard to get on with. Our Thought Adjuster does not expect uniformity from our friend. He knows that our friend likes to add the colour of his or her own personality to the tapestry of the group. Maybe our friend likes to stay in the shading colour of the background to give support to the highlight of another personality. Maybe he or she makes a marvellous listener. Our friend could be more a person of deeds than of words.

We all have many different talents. Let us be patient win each other, for those talents to enfold when the time is ripe. Let us be encouraging to each other. Let us not expect more from our friend than he is ready to achieve. Live and let live. Let us give each other the freedom to choose our own colour for this tapestry. Why not give the reins of our carriage to our Divine Coachman? Let us see things through the eyes of love. Every time we are tempted to become intolerant, let us remember that Divine Lover, who lives within our mind and who never runs out of patience or who never says: “I have been tolerant long enough now.” If we are truly serious about dedicating our life to doing the Father's will, then let us start identifying ourselves with our Divine Monitor, who never becomes offended. If wo want to be the disseminators of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, then let us be worthy of it.

Loving service is the best antidote for the unbalanced state of fanaticism or overintellectualization of _The URANTIA Book_. I'm sure there will be plenty of good suggestions on how we can best serve. I think together we could weave a beautiful tapestry of loving service, which is the only gift we can offer to our heavenly Father.
