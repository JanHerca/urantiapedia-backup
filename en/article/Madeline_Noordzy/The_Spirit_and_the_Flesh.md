On one of my many wondrous journeys through the Urantia Papers, I came across the name “Enoch” — “the first of the mortals of Urantia to fuse with the Thought Adjuster during the mortal life in the flesh.” <a id="a35_206"></a>[UB 45:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_13)

In this chapter he is mentioned as one of the four and twenty counselors of the Urantia advisory council, which has its headquarters on Jerusem, the capital of our local system Satania.

“Now where have I seen that name before?” I thought to myself. of course I don't have to tell all you good folks, but just in case there is one of our readers, whose grey matter up top doesn't always function as well as it should, just like mine often doesn't, I'm going to tell you that he is mentioned in the old Testament. In the Book of [Genesis, 5.18-24](/en/Bible/Genesis/5#v18). Under the descendants of Adam he is mentioned as follows: “When Jared was 162, he had a son, Enoch, and then lived another 800 years. He had other children and died at the age of 962 . When Enoch was 65, he had a son, Methuselah. After that, Enoch lived in fellowship with God for 300 years and had other children. He lived to be 365 years old. He spent his life in fellowship with God, and then he _disappeared_, because God took him away.”

Provided that I have picked the right Enoch, that is a very interesting statement. To the casual Bible reader it might not mean much, but to a reader of _the Urantia Book_ it could.

On <a id="a43_3"></a>[UB 110:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_2) we read: “When a human being has completed the circles of cosmic achievement, and further, when the final choosing of the mortal will permits the Adjuster to complete the association of human identity with the morontial soul during evolutionary and physical life, then do such consummated liaisons of soul and Adjuster go on independently to the mansion worlds, and there is issued the mandate from Uversa which provides for the immediate fusion of the Adjuster and the morontial soul. This fusion during physical life instantly consumes the material body; the human beings who might witness such a spectacle would only observe the translating mortal _disappear_ “in chariots of fire.” (Like the prophet Elijah did, [2 Kings 2:11](/en/Bible/2_Kings/2#v11).)

According to my calculations and using the ages of Adam's descendants, as the Book of Genesis gives them to us, Adam must have been 622 years when Enoch was born. (Adam died at 930 according to Genesis) But I think that the years were shorter in those days. (The U.B. tells us on <a id="a45_280"></a>[UB 76:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p5_5), that Adam lived for 530 years)

It is however almost certain that Enoch had quite a lot of the Adamic stock in him. And that would have helped him a tremendous lot with the development of his spiritual nature. He must have had a very experienced Thought Adjuster, how else did he manage to fuse in those long ago days almost 35,000 years from now and long before The Spirit of Truth was poured out over all flesh.

It is our problem today that we inherited so little of Adam's stock. We seem to have more conflicts between the spirit and the flesh than is the case on normal planets. On <a id="a49_172"></a>[UB 34:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_4) the U.B. tells us : “But even more disastrous was the Adamic default in that it deprived the races of that superior type of physical nature which would have been more consonant with spiritual aspirations.”

But then this Mighty Messenger gives us a terrific boost again by saying:"-present-day mortals would experience less of this apparent warfare between the flesh and the spirit if they would enter the spirit kingdom, wherein the faith sons of God enjoy comparative deliverance from the slave bondage of the flesh in the enlightened and liberating service of wholehearted devotion to doing the will of the Father in heaven. Jesus showed mankind the new way of mortal living whereby human beings may very largely escape the dire consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and most effectively compensate for the deprivations resulting from the Adamic default. “The spirit of the life of Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of animal living and the temptations of evil and sin.” “This is the victory that overcomes the flesh, even your faith.”

Shall we launch this new method at Weight Watchers?
