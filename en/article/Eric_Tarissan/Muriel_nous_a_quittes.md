_Editor's note: Muriel Saint-Pierre Tarissan, the mother of Éric Tarissan, died on April 22, 2023._

When my mother died at the age of 89, it was quite intense at the time, and I really regretted not having done more... two days later I wrote this little note (the title of which I later changed):
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## THE LAST WEEK

I saw you scared, alone in your room
That you still no longer recognized
And after talking to you and listening to you
After looking at each other and calming down
There was nothing more to say or add.

And in your eyes so blue I smiled at you
Which spontaneously made you smile too.
You shared your dreams and concerns with me
And the love you always had for the three of us
To tell me afterwards that we will see each other again soon

And unconsciousness came to calm the suffering
Stifling the anguish and all these pains
And unbeknownst to us, an angel came down
The face calm and at peace, the breath has stopped
And the sweet breath, this time, did not return.
But the angel was already far away now,
With your serene soul in his arms

Thank you Father for giving us all,
All the peace and love we need
And to Muriel, all the security and comfort
That I couldn't give him until the end.
Forgive me for this selfish neglect towards you, mom.
Who will always have loved me so naturally
I love you so much, but so awkwardly

See you later mom, I love you

A few days later, and because of this spiritual dimension which inhabits me and also because of all the teachings contained in _The Urantia Book_, I soon found peace and wrote this for my friends:

I cannot get attached to photos, linens, jewelry, etc., because my mother is no longer in this world, but rather in the world of houses where she continues her journey; and where we will all continue ours when we get there.

As I said these words to Nathalie (my partner), that evening, in my mind I saw my mother, from behind, standing on a path stretching out in front of her...

I find it wonderful to know, to have this reality within me that everything continues; and thanks to which I quickly found peace.

So much so that I wondered the first few days if I was normal! But, at the same time, Muriel had lived her life, and even she found that it no longer made sense: loss of hearing, mobility, memory... — at some point, enough is enough!

And she said it sometimes too, so that when she left, calmly and gently, almost imperceptibly, her face exuded a deep peace... and that also touched me a lot.

I asked my Adjuster to let me know (if possible) whether she was spirit-born or would be found with the sleeping survivors; but I didn't really get an answer.

Except that, at one point, while I was walking down the street, I intensely felt for 15 or 30 seconds, and it was profoundly divine, that my mother was there..., everywhere, all around me!!!

Even Nathalie, with whom she had a deep relationship, felt the same thing!

I know that my mother cannot be 'everywhere', since in fact, everyone's personality is always well located, here or on the mansion world, in a very specific place at the present moment, and that there is only the Divine Minister, the Supreme Being, the Spirit of Truth and God who are (and who can be, in their own way) — omnipresent.

If you only knew what went through my mind!

I said to myself: “Wow” - it's as if the departure of Muriel, my mother, had made me more sensitive to these spiritual realities! And that, more than anything, touched me deeply. Then Nathalie, who told me that, by leaving, my mother was leaving me room to get closer to my father...! And how! It was I who told her that she had fallen and, a week later, who told her that she had left. And it was there, at this precise and divine moment, that I was finally able to see my father as he was, without ego, and hold him in my arms! Bringing our relationship to another level a

Of course, once we're in the world of houses, we'll all be able to continue all those interrupted relationships! It's wonderful!

Thank you Father for everything! For all this love that we never cease to experience, by being able to constantly continue to live it, to share and to maintain it, from one world to another, by fulfilling ourselves and by constantly progressing!

I never cease to be delighted by this cosmic reality that I never cease to appreciate on a whole other level, because it is quite true that we will continue these interrupted relationships with all those who left before us, but also with many other personalities, some of whom have already known us...

And to see, to become aware of this cosmic reality (material worlds, morontial worlds, etc.), with so much hindsight (thanks to Muriel's departure), now gives me a whole perspective that is more real than ever. As if, with her departure, I too was ready to leave! Of course, I will continue my life, but with more calm and depth.

During the first days of mourning, at the end, I received these tears like caresses, like the last exchanges of love that I could still have with my mother. Now that the storm has passed and a new peace has settled, I notice little miracles happening around me and in my relationships, like so many divine winks, celestial hugs and little miracles from her hand, her hand that I took and squeezed when there was no other way to tell her how much I loved her, how much I love her even more and that nothing will ever change that, neither days, nor worlds, nor anyone.
