Following comments on a website about the war between the Jews of Israel and the Palestinians, here is the last reflection that I shared, in the context where Jesus' invitation was always: “If anyone desires to come, let him come.” I find it important to mention this extract from the life of Jesus which is very revealing, because it demonstrates and reveals that the Son of God invited everyone on this planet (and even an entire universe) to enter and participate in the kingdom of God. This invitation therefore transcends religions, races and even any idea of a so-called chosen people or promised land. Not only does this divine invitation to men teach us that the kingdom is indeed within reach, since God lives in each of us through the personality that He has given us, but also through His Presence in our higher mind in the form of a divine Monitor. So, without further ado, here is the text that I shared:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

Regarding human history, people have always been divided, initially according to their race and geographical origin. But there is also the fact that the ego, which identifies with its people, its race, its religion and its beliefs, also amplifies this phenomenon of division, thus maintaining the unconsciousness and the conflicts which result from it. Man forgets that in reality, we are ALL spiritually brothers and, consequently, that the borders have never had any authentic or real reasons for being. God being Infinite, He therefore reveals Himself to be the Unique Father of ALL the personalities who inhabit and will inhabit the universe.

## You also talk about Zionism.

To make a long story short, it would be good to remember that two thousand years ago, the Jewish people did not want to submit to the Roman Empire. And it cost them dearly, since after the killing of Jesus who, for the Jews, represented the messiah (and for the Sanhedrin, a threat), the Romans saw that at that moment they no longer had a leader. And that's when the Roman Empire took control, crucifying between 10,000 and 100,000 Jews aged between 15 and 35 and destroying their temple. A temple that the Jewish people rebuilt and that the Romans destroyed again. One wall remained, the famous “wailing wall”. But it was also at this key moment in history that the Romans excommunicated the Jewish people and they lost their country.

Subsequently, the Jewish people prospered in various countries by participating in their economy. They had quietly begun to acquire land in their lost country, but in 1939 Hitler wanted to seize their power and wealth by eliminating them. This war was terrible because although 6 million Jews died, 11 million Russians also died, not to mention the other millions of deaths of German, Austrian, English, French, Spanish, Polish soldiers and civilians, to name just a few!

In short, after the Second World War, the United States greatly helped the Jewish people to regain their country. But they did not do it democratically by continuing to buy land or through agreements, but rather by the same armed force that they themselves had just suffered and from which, sadly, it seems that no one has learned a lesson?!

## Because military force is not a solution.

It is not by crushing people or wanting to dominate them as the Romans did two thousand years ago that peace, balance, justice and harmony will see the light of day. Since man has been on earth, he has been at war, and it seems that he still does not understand that war is not a way to find peace. War, on the contrary, only maintains hatred and the spirit of vengeance between peoples.

How much more time will it take, how many more victims will it take, how many more wars, conflicts, suffering and injustice will it take before people understand that they will never find peace by remaining divided and fighting each other?

As long as men are incapable of forgiving each other, of shaking hands HONESTLY AND SINCERELY, and then uniting their strength, their intelligence and their experience; conflict, evil, egocentrism, unconsciousness and false freedom will persist and reign, nourished by the unconsciousness of all of us.
