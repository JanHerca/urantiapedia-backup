## Olga López

We arrived in Chicago on Thursday, July 13, tired from the trip but very excited to live the Leadership Symposium experience. Since I was in charge of doing the Spanish translations of many of the activities, I already had an idea of what the content of the symposium would be, but the final result exceeded all my expectations.

I have to thank the symposium organizers for the way they went out of their way to make sure our stay at Techny Towers ran smoothly. From day one there were dedicated volunteers picking up attendees at the airport and taking us to Techny, which is located north of the city of Chicago. And they also had the same attention on the last day, already back to our homes. My deepest thanks to all of them!

The activities had two well differentiated parts. In the morning we had plenary sessions, to which we all attended and where we were given brief talks in which experiences of a very diverse nature were shared, but all related to the dissemination of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and with the novel concept of “leader” who is associated with the fifth epochal revelation. Maybe the word “leader” scares us a little, but I think we have to get rid of that “respect” and reaffirm ourselves in what is important: that, no matter what we are called, we are embarked on the life project of serving our fellow men by giving to know the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. As was said on numerous occasions throughout the Symposium, we are all leaders and have something to contribute.

The second part came in the afternoon, in the group sessions, sessions organized in the form of questions that had to be answered by the group, related to the talks that had been given in the morning. The groups were organized so that the members were the same throughout the Symposium. In this way we got to know each other and fraternize very well. These groups were identified with names of towns that are mentioned in _The Urantia Book_; Specifically, I was in the “Adamsonites” group, in which I had the opportunity to chat and fraternize with fellow readers from Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, as well as with my friends Sheila from the US and Ismael, a groupmate from studio who traveled with me to experience the Symposium.

During meals and after activities we always had the opportunity to socialize with the attendees. We were many and it was physically impossible to talk to everyone, but there are moments of fraternization that I will remember throughout my life and beyond. Magical moments in which you feel that souls speak face to face without barriers or intermediaries. Really for that alone it is worth attending this type of meeting.

On Sunday morning, the last day of our activities, our hearts were divided: on the one hand, we wanted to go home, but on the other, we wanted to extend our stay a little longer and continue living in that fraternizing atmosphere, so difficult to find. in our daily life. That morning there was a worship session that was really nice, and a “remembrance dinner” with the reading of passages from the UB. At the end, Gaétan Charland, president of the UAI, gave a final speech in which he encouraged us to teach in our countries everything we had learned in that symposium, and to apply it to publicize the teachings of the book and thus, together, get a little closer to light and life. And we will do that!

“What am I doing here?” I asked myself over and over again as soon as I landed in Chicago. I admit that, although I was excited about this event, inside I had many doubts. Once the symposium was over, and after calmly reflecting on this whole experience, I returned to Spain renewed and with redoubled strength. It has been a great experience!

First of all I want to show my gratitude to Olga, for all the trouble she has taken with me (which has been a lot) both in the necessary paperwork, as a guide at the airports, as a translator during the event and several other things. At her side it is very easy to travel, I don't know how everything would have gone without her by my side... thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I must congratulate UAI for choosing the venue for the symposium... at $30 Km$. from Chicago was Techny Towers, a spiritual retreat center that I loved. The lushness of the place made me feel at home from the first moment... tranquility and good company was what I needed.

From the first moment, we all began to fraternize. The language was not an insurmountable obstacle, since there were many brothers who performed the role of translators, even without them we found a way to communicate. In total we must have been about 150 people... it was exciting, different races, different cultures, different languages but all united and sharing experiences during those days. There were only four of us Spaniards: Olga, Mariano, his wife Blanca and I... but I think we left the flag high, especially in the improvised “karaoke” on Saturday night, ha ha.

We made many friends; It is difficult to explain the feelings of such events, but I have to say that the atmosphere was special. Now I understand the importance of being able to live moments like this, the illusion, the reigning twinning created an “energy” difficult to describe but that had you as if plunged into a peaceful dream.

During the mornings we attended various talks by members of the UAI. During them we had simultaneous translation service... they were very interesting. There were talks on almost everything: personal experiences, speeches, practical spirituality, forms of worship and prayer, etc. There I understood the concept that Urantia Foundation has of “leadership” and I must say that it reassured me. The UB is a book ahead of its time, destined to train future teachers and instructors... that is why ALL of us who find ourselves immersed in the arduous task of disseminating the UB and its spirit are leaders. Through our personal transformation, through our “shine” towards others, regardless of our talents or fields of action, we can all be leaders... in fact we are, we are all leading. We just have to be convinced of it and keep working.

I really liked the details about the history of the UB and about its preparation. As I looked at the slides of those men and women, I realized something: The entire preparation of UB, from the time Dr. Sadler began receiving information to its publication... took fifty years! Incredible. That leads me to think that we must be very patient, we must sow and sow... Whoever has to do it will pick up.

I liked knowing first-hand the members of the Foundation, normal and excited people. People who gladly assume the responsibility of pulling this car, people who contribute their precious time and even money so that UB reaches every corner of the world. Very valid people who brought us up to date on all the ins and outs of the foundation and who encouraged us to discover for ourselves that indeed we can all be leaders, we are all leaders. Humble and close people regardless of their social status... I really liked them!

One of the days there was something that I loved: there was a sincere and public offer from Urantia Association International to the Fellowship, to iron out old differences and differences. That is the way to go, objective unity without the need for uniformity.

They took us to Chicago one afternoon and I was “home”! It is a unique building. Although I liked it, I must say that it was very good for me to meet him because it helped me to demystify him. Just as the Foundation members were normal people, the house was just that: a house with a great story to tell, but still a house.

We dedicated the afternoons to group work. Depending on the language, groups of eight to ten people were formed and in them we worked on the topic of leadership and what we think it is. It was exciting to share experiences, such diverse opinions... we all participated. I sincerely believe that great future relationships were forged there between very distant and different people, it was a delight. Different ways of seeing and understanding things, incredible personal experiences... it all adds up, they were great moments that were forever etched in my memory. Everyone: Sheila, Olga, Beatriz, Susana, Nemias, Alfredo, etc., they all poured out their best in those sessions and we all came out of there more complete... a special memory especially for my little Bolivian sister Marianela, whom I knew Internet, and with whom I ended up having some very interesting conversations of which I keep indelible memories. You should know her: she is the sweetest and most tender person I have ever seen.

The nights were for socializing, and boy did we. In an exclusive room for this we had a great time... moments of fun are also very important in events like these. We also had two concerts: a very electrifying rap concert. The other one was held in the interior chapel of that magnificent building, it was a concert for piano, violin and a soloist... it was MAGNIFICENT.

I must congratulate the organization of the symposium because it was a very varied and successful event, there was time for everything. The food, the accommodation and, above all, the availability of each and every one of our American friends, made us feel at home at all times.

Now I understand the need to organize international events of this type... My illusion has increased considerably, my commitment is now greater and above all it has helped me to reaffirm myself in everything I believe in... in God. Hundreds of brothers around the world strive daily to spread the UB in the world in the most curious ways you can imagine. Hundreds of them make an effort to personally progress in the ability to intuit the will of the Father and to materialize it with their hands on the planet. We are not alone, always keep that in mind. Symposiums like the one in Chicago are eye-openers, so I encourage everyone to attend as little as you can. Next year the international conference will be held in Colombia, ¡ANIMAOS!

It is difficult to convey the experience lived at the Leadership Symposium in Chicago, since explaining feelings, sensations, human relationships, does not stop being something within the sentimental personal terrain of each attendee.

Many have been the manifestations of gratitude and enthusiasm on the part of all the participants, after the days lived. The e-mails have overwhelmed my mail, in English, in Spanish and even in French; some in all three languages.

It is curious, how people of all nationalities and with different languages come to be brothers, come to feel that they are not alone, that with them there are many other brothers and sisters who have the same feelings: divine filiation, universal brotherhood, and even they feel wrapped up by someone else, by those who are not visible to our eyes. At certain moments, it was like becoming aware that the 5th Revelation brought about by the cosmic hosts, were seen embodied, even culminated to this day, in a summit meeting, special like that. Surely they observed us with great pleasure.

Trying, later, to find out why all of us present at such a special event felt different from other national and international meetings (and I am not saying this because I felt that way from the beginning, but rather it was something that was consolidated), I come to the following conclusion:

Some activities took place in which what is potentially in our souls emerged, an elevated feeling of love for the Father and for humanity, more markedly towards those present; The organizers were very successful in that. Regardless of presentations of various kinds, group work, where the experiences of other brothers from South America (in our case) were shared, and which were an important contribution, it was possible for it to emerge in most of us, I suppose in all of us, something that is above words, that cannot be easily explained. Perhaps the spiritual beings, our supervisors, wanted to help us by sending some kind of spiritual energy, being predisposed to receive it as we were, I don't know, but the truth is that something was happening. Something that, in hindsight, seems even increased. And it is that the Revelation is not only to intellectualize it, but to feel it, to feel the love with which its filmmakers made it, and to live it. The latter entails a commitment to oneself, to work the virtues and seek to do the will of the Father.

In truth, I feel, at least I, have left the Symposium more aware of the important and fundamental role that all readers of The Urantia Book have, and above all, those who want, rather, who feel the need to make known their teachings or the book itself, knowing that this will contribute to awakening faith and hope in hearts.

We were not given any specific guidelines, we were not told what to do or how we should launch our projects after the Symposium, but I do think that the motivation was achieved, the necessary strength to continue working towards that objective, although surely, in the future. deep down, it was already inside of us.
