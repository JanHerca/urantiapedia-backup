Service? Seemingly a common word; yet what does it really mean? Pause and reflect a moment on what service means to you and then read on as I attempt to share some thoughts with you.

As I tried to determine what service meant to me, an earlier picture of myself flashed upon my mental viewing screen, The setting for the scene was an encounter with some acquaintances with whom I had attempted to talk, concerning _The URANTIA Book_. I had entered the encounter with enthusiasm and an eagerness to share the truths I had found, but I met suspicion and doubt. I left with a sense of disappointment and misunderstanding, asking myself, “why didn't they believe me?”

Now, after some time and some thought adjustment, I think the more accurate question is, “why should they have believed me?” After all, weren't there many individuals and groups who claimed to possess truth? Why should anyone accept what I have to say?

When I asked the latter question, I felt as though my mind were a reservoir and the dam had been opened allowing pent up thoughts to gush forth from seemingly many directions and levels. I remembered an acquaintance with whom I didn't share common values or ideas but for whom I felt warmth because he had once been kind to me when I was in need, I remembered some psychological research which concluded that the type of therapy used was secondary in importance to the ability of the therapist to develop a sense of trust between a patient and himself. Then I recalled how Jesus loved to do little things for people.

It seemed as though the pieces were beginning to fit into place and there was an air of mild excitement as I sensed I was about to discover a new insight.

What I had realized is that before I could expect others to listen to what I had to say, I had to befriend them and develop a sense of trust, openess and honesty with them. If I could accomplish that, then, when the time was ripe, they might ask the questions which would allow me to introduce _The URANTIA Book_ teachings. Moreover, we could exchange our ideas in an atmosphere of peace rather than in the suspicious, defensive atmosphere I used to encounter.

As my new insight was growing clearer, I recalled from the teachings that to love someone was to desire to do good to them and that to serve someone was to provide for their needs. These thoughts helped me to realize further that perhaps we best serve others when we are good listeners instead of talkers, when we are responsive to others' needs, no matter how small, rather than doing what we want to for them, which may only be placing our own needs first. Often a single act of kindness may be the most important service we can provide.

If Jesus loved to do little things for people, then surely it must be worth the effort to try to understand the wisdom of this approach. And did he not say that if we wish to be great, we must learn to be of service to all?
