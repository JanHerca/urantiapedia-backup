As we search to build a foundation upon which all the religions of the world can stand, perhaps no other concept offers such a solid cornerstone as that of communication with the Thought Adjuster. Regardless of the disparities in their cosmologies, theologies, liturgies, etc., most religions would recognize that the relationship between God and man is one of the most important issues. As a result, we have an immediate bridge to help us cross over to various religious traditions. And, perhaps most importantly, a reservoir of religious tradition is found to which we can not only give but from which we can also take. I emphasize taking from other religious traditions because many people appear strained to find something of value in the various religious traditions.

The first step is to open our minds and look for what is similar in religious traditions instead of what is different.

We have learned that the Thought Adjuster indwells our minds. Also, we have learned that if we wish to postulate a subconscious realm of the mind, we should also postulate a superconscious realm. This superconscious realm is the abode of the Adjuster. To attempt to communicate with the Adjuster, we should direct our mind to the superconscious level. This can best be achieved when we are at ease, ie., when our minds are free from domination by any particular thought, our emotions are under control, and our bodies are relaxed and tension-free.

How do we achieve such a state that will make us ready for prayer and worship, i.e., communication with the Adjuster? How do we bring our minds and bodies to this receptive state? Most religions offer methods which are peculiar to their religious traditions. It is these traditions which I alluded to in the opening paragraph. One would have to search long and hard to find a religion which does not offer a method of preparing oneself to communicate with God.

What method do you use? Do you require the serenity and emotional aura of a cathedral? Do you have your private sanctuary at home with prayer book and candles? Do you have some favorite music you listen to? Do you jog or use some form of physical exercise?

Do you meditate using a mantra or repeat prayers on a rosary? Does it help to wonder by yourself in your favorite nature setting? Is there a particular type of yoga you prefer or a favorite chant or gospel song?

My point is that all of the methods described above, which come from various religious traditions, are means of achieving the calm and receptive state that is most conducive to communication with the Adjuster. In effect, reciting a mantra, repeating prayers on a rosary, etc., are all designed to achieve the same purpose. Consequently, you can look at these religious traditions as offering various techniques which may help you in quieting your mind and body. Of course we are cautioned not to pursue mysticism and the unconscious dimension too far, but these techniques can be used to reach a receptive state. Then, you can turn your consciousness to the superconscious level and the Adjuster rather than delving further into the unconscious realm.

When I look at someone reciting prayers or meditating in a lotus position, I see them both striving to achieve the same goal, i.e., communication with the Father. Different religious practices and traditions no longer seem so strange because I realize they share a common motive. And, who is to say which technique is best? Although we have an enlightened explanation of reality in _The URANTIA Book_, we must also seek the best method to commune with our Father and to enhance our personal religious experiences. It would seem unwise to ignore the wealth of experience contained in the various religious traditions for they have all had their saints and enlightened ones who described the joy and ecstasy of their personal experiences with God.

Though some of the experiences may have been delusions, it would seen unfair to discount all of them. I think of them as similar to the concept of the downgrasp of the Adjuster. We are instructed that when a person's motives are ideal and his mind, emotions, and body are in a proper state, it is possible for the Adjuster to effect this downgrasp, this moment of communication. Even the thought of such an experience is exciting, let alone the indescribable joy that one would surely have by actively experiencing it.

To close my circle of thought, I conclude with my beginning that as we search to build a foundation upon which all the religions of the world can stand, the concept of man's communication with God offers a rich tradition to which we can give and from which we can receive. The various religious traditions of Urantia offer methods which we can use to enhance our personal communication with our Adjuster. And, let us never forget that all individuals, regardless of their religious traditions, are indwelt by a fragment of the Father and deserve our respect.
