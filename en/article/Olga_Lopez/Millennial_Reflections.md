_By Olga Lopez, Associate Trustee, Urantia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain_

_Editors Note: The July 2008 quarterly meeting of the Board of Trustees was held in Los Angeles at the same time the International Conference of the Urantia Book Fellowship was held. The April quarterly meeting of the Board of Trustees will be held in conjunction with the Urantia Association International (UAI) conference in Malaga, Spain. The following is a report from Olga Lopez on the conference planned for April, 2009._

The 2009 UAl Conference is going to be held from the 17th to the 21st of April in Malaga, Spain. The UAI holds an international conference every 3 years, and readers from around the world will have the occasion to meet and share their insights concerning the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. The last UAI conference was held in Sydney, Australia in the summer 2006.

We chose Malaga because of its privileged location in Southern Spain, a beautiful area with millions of visitors each year. It is quite close to Seville, Granada, and Cordoba. The international airport makes connections to other cities in Spain and Europe very convenient.

This conference will be special for several reasons. The most important one is that, for the first time, an international conference for Urantia Book readers will be held in a Spanish speaking country. This shows appreciation and support for the Urantia movement in Spanish speaking countries, where readership is increasing every year. In addition, Spain is in Europe, where the Urantia movement is growing steadily and many translations of _The Urantia Book_ exist: the French, Finish, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, and Rumanian. It will be easier for European readers to attend this international conference. We Spaniards would like to play the role of “bridge”, a role that the Iberian Peninsula has played for centuries-a bridge between peoples and cultures. This is why we chose the theme for this conference: “Bridging the Gap from Disharmony to Universal Unity”.

I encourage you to come to this international conference. We set the price as inexpen- sive as possible to offer you quality lodging (400 Euros per person, 4 nights including all meals). Conference activities will be conducted in Spanish and English.

With my experience attending and hosting meetings for Urantia Book readers, there is always a special atmosphere when the groups meet. Anyone who has ever attended a meeting for readers knows what the harmony among human beings must be like on the spheres of Light and Life. So, come to Spain in April to savor this wonderful experience!
