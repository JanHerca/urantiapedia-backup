_By Olga López, Barcelona, Spain_

The sixteenth meeting of Spanish readers, sponsored by the Urantia Association of Spain, began on the afternoon of Friday, April 28, at the Hotel Tryp in Guadalajara, Spain (near the capital, Madrid). The conference was attended by almost fifty people, from the north, east, and south of Spain. The theme of this meeting was God in Man, which is the title of Section 6 in Paper 108, “Mission and Ministry of Thought Adjusters.”

The main subject of discussion was the Thought Adjuster: What is it? What does it do? And what shall we become together? On this occasion, one of the main goals was to coordinate presentations, so that they could approach different aspects of the Thought Adjusters and our relationship to them without being redundant.

On Friday evening, I gave a presentation about the history of the fifth epochal revelation because there are many readers who are confused about the people and the circumstances involved in the delivery of the Urantia Revelation. This is part of a series of presentations to inform the Spanish readers about the historic and organizational background of _The Urantia Book_.

On Saturday morning, the first presentation was given by Carmelo Martínez, whose title was simply “God in Man,” and its purpose was to set the tone for the succeeding presentations.

We also had a presentation from Mariano Pérez, titled “The Action of the Thought Adjuster in Man.” In his presentation, Mariano focused on the material support for the Thought Adjuster—our brain and our glands, mainly the pineal gland-related to spiritual activity.

In the afternoon, we enjoyed some socializing time, taking a walk in Guadalajara and seeing some of its most famous architecture. We even had the chance to taste Guadalajara's famous “borrachos” which are a local dessert consisting of little sponge cakes dipped in sweet syrup.

After the city tour, we celebrated the marriage of two attendees. Their wedding took place two weeks prior to the conference, and they brought their family to share this joy with us. We were all deeply moved. We Spanish readers are a big and loving family!

Sunday morning we had two very innovative presentations given by two talented women. One of the two women was Paula Requejo, who made an inspiring presentation titled “The Persistence of True Values,” using a PowerPoint presentation with evocative images and a main character called “Urantina,” a little girl who discovers what these true values are in her daily life.

The second of the two women, María José Sánchez Santamaría, took us on a trip to Paradise and beyond with our Thought Adjusters long after fusion. In her presentation, titled “The Adjuster and the Soul,” she used little moments of meditation, music, and words to help us fly away in the company of our Thought Adjusters. It was really amazing!

For the first time, the presentations were broadcast and recorded via Zoom, so they can be uploaded to the YouTube channel of the Association in the near future. Some readers showed up via Zoom to attend the presentations in this virtual room. With proper

microphones and technology, this may prove to be the solution for people who want to listen to the presentations but can't attend the meeting.

Sunday afternoon was the time for workshops. Each attendee was assigned to a workshop randomly, so that groups were as heterogeneous as possible. Each workshop was about a topic related to the Thought Adjuster:

- The Nature of Thought Adjusters
- The Psychic Circles
- Adjusters on Urantia
- Erroneous Concepts of Adjuster Guidance
- The Human Paradox

After this small-groupworkshop activity, we had some sharing time with the larger group and ended with a lively discussion.
And let us not forget the evenings! As usual, we kept up our long-time tradition of engaging in spontaneous discussions until our eyes grew heavy.

On Sunday, we had a meeting of the Urantia Association of Spain, in which the board reported on the Association's activities in 2016. After lunch, it was time to say our goodbyes. But we attendees are already looking forward to next year's meeting.
