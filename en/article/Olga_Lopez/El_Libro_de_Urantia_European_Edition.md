_By Olga López, Associate Trustee, Urantia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain_

_Editor's Note: The revision of _El Libro de Urantia_ has been a high priority for Urantia Foundation. Dissemination efforts in Mexico, Central and South America, Spain, and other Spanish-speaking countries throughout the world have created an unprecedented interest in the Spanish translation. This interest has occasioned a pressing need to revise, update, and correct the 1993 text._

Three “teams” have been charged with making revisions to the 1993 text. One team, consisting of L.P. (Mexico) and Alejandra Escudero (Mexico) have been making corrections to the text. A second team, consisting of Víctor Garcia Bory (United States) and Carmelo Martínez (Spain) have been making revisions to the text. A third team, led by Antonio Moya, has completed a correction and revision of the text which will be printed as a “_European edition_” and will be marketed for readers in Spain.

The Board of Trustees of the Urantia Foundation decided to print a European edition of _El Libro de Urantia_ and to limit sales to Spain. This European edition is the culmination of eight years of work done by Antonio Moya of Seville, Spain, and supported by the Seville study group, the first and still-going (for almost 25 years) study group in Spain. 


Antonio Moya and the Seville study group started reading the French translation of _The Urantia Book_ in the 1980s be-cause the Spanish translation was not yet published. For years the Sevillian readers kept the Urantia fires burning in Spain. They communicated with Urantia Foundation regularly and answered Spanish readers' of _El Libro de Urantia_ will help requests. The readers in Spain to disseminate the book and will always be grateful to them its teachings in Spain. for laying the foundations for a healthy and spirited Urantia movement in Spain.

Many of us in Spain believe that the Foundation's decision to print the European edition of _El Libro de Urantia_ will help to disseminate the book and its teachings in Spain.
