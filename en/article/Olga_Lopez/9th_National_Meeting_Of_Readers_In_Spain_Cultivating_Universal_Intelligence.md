_By Olga López, Associate Trustee, Barcelona, Spain_

The ninth national meeting for readers of _El Libro de Urantia_ was held from May 7 to 9 in Aluenda, Spain, a small village near Zaragoza. Thirtytwo people attended this meeting; most of them were long-time readers, members of a study group, and regular attendees at our meetings. Our readers ask for more and more each year. So we - as the Urantia Association of Spain - try to give them what they want!

We wanted this meeting to be different from the previous ones, in that we wanted tools for our self-improvement and for the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ teachings in a more advanced way. Sheila Keene-Lund was our keynote speaker and gave a two-day seminar titled “How to Cultivate Universal Intelligence,” that is, how to apply _The Urantia Book_ teachings to improve ourselves and our environment. Sheila based this seminar on her book, _Heaven is Not the Last Stop_.

There were many interesting points in the seminar. Sheila shared her life experience with us, and we did the same. We talked about how _The Urantia Book_ aides us in our personal improvement. We participated in many activities, sharing our thoughts and participating in selfdiscovery through the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. We used the life and teachings of Jesus as a model of a person who cultivated universal intelligence.

The meeting was edifying to all the people who attended, and we are considering holding more meetings that are practice oriented and focused on dissemination.

We thank Sheila for giving us so many valuable insights. ¡Muchas gracias!
