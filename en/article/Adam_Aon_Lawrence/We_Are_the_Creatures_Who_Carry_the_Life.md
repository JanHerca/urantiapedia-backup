<p style="text-align:center;">
We are the creatures who carry the life. <br>
We strive hard to make you your life. <br>
We are your ancestors. <br>
<br>
We are the ones who helped make you possible. <br>
You can’t live without us. <br>
Did you know that we are the ones who helped you grow? <br>
<br>
We started by planting a seed in shallow warm bays <br>
And watched over it for many, many days. <br>
It started to grow big and strong <br>
And then many life forms evolved along. <br>
Then went on to shore in different sizes and shapes <br>
Including elephants, dolphins, bananas and apes. <br>
<br>
We are the ones who carry the life. <br>
We are the ones who strive hard to make the life. <br>
And do you know what happened next? <br>
It turned pretty complex. <br>
Life continued to grow bigger and bigger <br>
Until the world was covered with animals <br>
Grazing, running, jumping and playing. <br>
<br>
Then something magical happened. <br>
Monkeys started walking on two legs <br>
And turned into these human like creatures <br>
With many features <br>
Who lived in caves. <br>
<br>
Soon they started to grow and evolve <br>
Then they built houses and cars and bars. <br>
Then many of them came <br>
And started making cities, rockets and trains. <br>
They made TV’s, movies and all kinds of crazy stuff, <br>
Books and cartoons and I don’t know what. <br>
<br>
We moved on to another planet <br>
They had lives of their own <br>
This is how far time has gone along. <br>
Please ask no more, it’s the end of my song. <br>
</p>
