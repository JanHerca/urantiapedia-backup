Recently one of the members of a local study group introduced his new pastor to The Urantia $B o o k$, a practice he has exercised for many years. The pastor seemed to show genuine interest, unlike most of his predecessors. He is a fellow pastor that I recently met and lives not far away, and I rejoiced at the thought that he might discover this amazing resource-in truth, a revelation.

Of course I've learned over the years not to let my expectations soar too high. Only a few of those, including close friends that I felt were ready and open and with whom I shared the book, took more than a passing interest. Their reaction often turned to puzzlement and dismay, and occasionally even put a strain upon what I thought were enduring and unshakable bonds. Most of us have experienced this many times, and it may have slowed down our once unbounded enthusiasm and left us more than a little cautious.

Nevertheless, occasionally the book at least gets passed around and real interest emerges in new and surprising ways. Just the thought of someone discovering what we've discovered is enough to cause our hearts to leap for joy.

So it is this mix of joy and discouragement that seems to be the lot of those blessed with finding _The Urantia Book_ and bound by honesty and good will, if not a clear sense of calling, to seek to share it with others.

I think it is something we need to be both wise and naive about-wise as serpents, and innocent as doves, as it were. We must be wise about the obstacles to belief and even open inquiry, and yet able to present it to people without investing ourselves too much in the outcome.

It's not always easy to do, just as it isn't easy to keep plugging away at goals and dreams that are so desirable, but whose realization may lie far in the future-such as TSF. We try to do well what is in our power to do, and wait patiently for the unfolding of things in God's own way.

There is one clear and immediate and unshakable source of joy that is always there, however, and that, of course, is the book itself. There is no end to the continuing growth, the serendipitous joy, the refreshment of our souls that emerges when we engage its witness.

The second is like unto it: the joy and satisfaction of not just talking about the book and seeking to share it with others, but seeking to live out the truth and Good News we find there-to love others and bestow our lives in self-forgetful service, and rejoice that we are a part of God's family here on earth as well as in the eternal realms.

This, of course, is the point of the revelation to begin with, and it is a source of endless encouragement and joy in what often seems a barren and lonely vigil.

There is one more thing: keeping in touch with others who know the special joy, and seeking to encourage each other as fellow sojourners in our common effort.

May God strengthen us and give us the grace to do all of these.
