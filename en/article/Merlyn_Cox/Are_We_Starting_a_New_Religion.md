One of the stated goals of _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ is to “address issues of special concern in the establishment of new religious institutions with roots in the Fifth Epochal Revelation.”

It may seen obvious to many that new religious institutions will appear as part of the impact of _The Urantia Book_, but it is not necessarily viewed as a good thing, or one to be encouraged. Many in the Urantia movement view all religious institutions with suspicion. The dangers of institutional religion are clearly pointed out in the pages of _The Urantia Book_, and those suspicions have been validated in the personal experience of countless readers.

Nevertheless, _The Urantia Book_ suggests that institutional expressions of religious beliefs are natural and inevitable, if not absolutely necessary, and rather than bemoan the inevitable problems that will arise, we should be wise in recognizing their values as well as their limitations. (<a id="a40_292"></a>[UB 87:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_1))

A related question that is often asked, then, is: Are we starting a _new religion_?

> _The word religion can mean many different things, even if everyone has a sense of what it means._

It is not as easy to answer as might first appear. The word religion can mean many different things, even if everyone has a sense of what it means. _The Urantia Book_ says “Religion requires no definition; we all know its social, intellectual, moral and spiritual fruits. And this all grows out of the fact that religion is the property of the human race; it is not a child of culture.” (<a id="a46_388"></a>[UB 102:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_1))

Nevertheless, its use in our language and culture covers a broad range of meanings.

Religion is generally recognized as “a way of life or belief based on a person's ultimate relation to the universe or God...”[^1] Paul Tillich, considered one of the great 20^th^ centuries theologians, spoke of religion as one's “ultimate concern.” Martin Luther, in a similar fashion, said “whatever one's heart clings to and trusts in, that is one's God.” Thus, a person's belief system concerning ultimate things (what one's heart clings to) may include a lot that we would not deem very religious by ordinary definition, or worthy by most definitions. Usually, however, we reserve the word religion for belief systems that include belief in a deity and a way of “salvation” or liberation — in the afterlife, if not in the here and now. 

One's religion is thus primarily about a personal experience and basic orientation to the whole of life. But the word “religion” is also used for the attending set of beliefs (i.e., creeds), sacred scriptures, ethical code of conduct, liturgy, and order and structure that go along with a community of believers who share those same basic beliefs.

Thus “religion” may be used to describe one's personal faith and beliefs, or it can mean a commonly held system of beliefs and its social expression by a community. Jesus made it clear that the essence of religion is the faith relationship between the individual and the Creator/Father. The distinction between personal and institutional religion is underscored in _The Urantia Book_ with a quote from [Romans 14](/en/Bible/Romans/14), “Have you faith? Then, have it unto yourself.” (<a id="a54_484"></a>[UB 99:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5))

> _The distinction between personal and institutional religion is underscored in _The Urantia Book_ by with a quote from Romans 14, "Have you faith? Then, have it unto yourself.” (UB 99:5)_

Paul Tillich also wrote: “‘Revelation’ speaks of a divine, ‘religion’ of a human, action. ‘Religion’ speaks of culture, ‘revelation’ of that which lies beyond culture.” “Revelation has to do with the absolute; religion with the relative.”[^2]

There is obviously a great gulf between the authority of revelation and the cultural response we often refer to as religion. The major “religions” of Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, are the result over time of the human response, individual and community, to divine revelation.

When Ganid suggested to Jesus, after their survey of the world's religions, that they create a new religion, Jesus replied: “Ganid, religions are not made. The religions of men grow up over long periods of time, while the revelations of God flash upon the earth in the lives of the men who reveal God to their fellows.” (<a id="a62_321"></a>[UB 132:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_6))

While the use of the term “religion” will depend on one's usage and definition, in the end, I think, it is more correct to say that while we might begin a new religious fellowship, a new “church,” or a new institution based on The Fifth Epochal Revelation, we are not starting a new religion.

To the degree that religion refers to one's personal faith, it is a reflection of the work of the Spirit-Adjuster in the life of the individual and not something we create by individual effort alone, let alone by group effort. To the degree religion is used to describe the intentional efforts of religionists to cooperate and share in group worship, ministry, outreach (evangelism), and service, it a religious “institution,” not the faith conviction of the individual personality.

In common usage we might speak of our desire to start a new religion; but if so, it would clearly mean a social, institutional expression of our common beliefs and values.

This discussion, I believe, poses an interesting question to many in the Urantia Movement: Is an informal study group that does no more than gather on a regular basis, with little or no shared public prayer or worship, or social or evangelical outreach, a “religious” organization?

> _In common usage we might speak of our desire to start a new religion; but if so, it would clearly mean a social, institutional expression of our common beliefs and values._

I would suggest the answer with another question: Is a group that meets regularly to study a book that purports to be an epochal revelation to mankind, whose purpose is, from beginning to end, to introduce us to a new and fuller understanding of God's purposes for us and all Creation, and includes 800 plus pages on the life and teachings of Jesus, a “religious” organization? How would you answer?

What is certain, I think, is that a new religion _will_ emerge as the human response to the Fifth Epochal Revelation. It will be the reflection and sum of the beliefs of countless individuals as well as countless groups, formal and informal, with many of them growing out of the great religious traditions of the world, leavened by this revelation. All of this will begin in the hearts of believers, one at a time.

In his discourse or true religion, Jesus said “we will... shortly begin the bold proclamation of a new religion — a religion which is not a religion in the present day meaning of the word, a religion that makes its chief appeal to the Spirit of my Father which resides in the mind of man; a religion which shall derive its authority from the fruits of its acceptance.” (<a id="a78_370"></a>[UB 155:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_12))

The name we might give to any of this is pretty much arbitrary and largely irrelevant. It will not define or limit the work of the Spirit. We hope it will not get in the way. Our task is to go about it as wisely as possible, realizing the final result will be in the Father's hands.
