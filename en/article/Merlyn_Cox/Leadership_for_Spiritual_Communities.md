The Spiritual Fellowship is working to establish spiritual communities called fellowships where like-minded people can worship and serve together. When do these communities need leadership, and if so, what type of leadership do they need?

## The Need For Leadership

Many Urantia study groups operate with little or no leadership. They may be able to operate by consensus since their only object is to study _The Urantia Book_ together. Why can't a fellowship operate this way as well? If a fellowship is small and only comes together for worship, it may still be able to operate mainly by consensus or with rotating leadership. However, if the fellowship decides to undertake some outreach programs, or begins to grow and initiate new programs, the need for a person to coordinate the activities of the group becomes apparent. Jesus saw to it that the Apostles had leadership by appointing Andrew to lead the group. At the end of their work, Jesus told Andrew, “_Ever since the ordination of you and your brethren as messengers of the kingdom, you have been self-governing in all group administrative affairs except that I designated you as the acting head of these chosen ones. In no other temporal matter have I acted to direct or to influence your decisions. And this I did in order to provide for leadership in the direction of all your subsequent group deliberations. In my universe and in my Father's universe of universes, our brethren-sons are dealt with as individuals in all their spiritual relations, but in all group relationships we unfailingly provide for definite leadership._”

It's not that people need to be told what to do; it's that a group needs someone to help them stay focused and on course as they carry out new programs. Someone needs to have an overview of the programs and activities of a larger fellowship so they can help coordinate the efforts of the various groups within the fellowship. The leader is a focal point and clearing house for inter-group cooperation and communication, or at least the person who gets the proper parties together to discuss problems. The leader may also be the spokesperson for the group for outside contacts. Perhaps a better title for the leader of a fellowship is facilitator.

In the past, the old pyramid style of leadership used in industry was also the model used by leaders of religious organizations. The information flowed mostly from the top down in such organizations. This model, probably originating from military organizations, has worked in the past, but it has many problems. It does not invite full participation and feedback from those doing the hands-on work. New models of leadership try to fully involve all members of an organization in decision making so they have a sense of ownership of whatever job the organization chooses to undertake. Probably the most radical model of leadership was one suggested by Jesus.

Jesus said, “_Remember, I have taught you that he who would be greatest among you should become the server of all._” (<a id="a46_118"></a>[UB 175:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_10)) This may be a hard thing for some leaders to do. Many in leadership positions seem to have large egos. You must certainly have confidence to be an effective leader but yet resist placing yourself above those who have chosen you as their leader.

## Source Of Leaders

Are leaders born or made? Probably both. Some people seem to manifest a talent for leadership at a very young age. But no matter how much talent a person may have, it is not useful until developed and nurtured. And sometimes, a person will be called into leadership simply because he or she is the only one willing to do the job. In the Biblical story of Moses, he protested that he was not a good speaker, but God didn't let him off the hook. He was the man to do the job, and he did it well. But even if a person has little native talent, with training and experience, most persons can become acceptable leaders.

## Roles and Tasks of Leaders

1. ***Coordinator of efforts***: Leaders must be able to understand the overall structure and goals of the group they lead, and be able to foster cooperation within the group. They need to see the big picture and how each person can contribute to the overall goal.
2. ***Leaders are focal points for the group***. Especially in larger organizations, the leader needs to be an information gatherer and an information disseminator.
3. ***Spokesperson***: When an outside person or another organization wants information about a group, the leader is often the spokesperson for the group.
4. ***Conflict resolution***: In the event of a dispute within the group, the leader needs to help the disagreeing parties work through the problem without undue acrimony. Or if the leader is one of the disagreeing parties, he or she may need to seek outside mediation to help resolve the problem.

## Types of Leaders

There are many styles of leadership, some good, some not so good. It is important to recognize that the leadership of a fellowship is quite different from leadership in a business, though the principles of good leadership are universal. Fortunately, many businesses are taking note of the benefits of participatory management and the human side of interactions. [^1]

**Here are some leadership styles:**

1. **Pragmatic**: This leader tries to get done what needs to be done.
2. **Intellectual**: This leader is strong on ideas but may lack people skills. 
3. **Humanistic**: This leader empathizes with people and nurtures them.
4. **Authoritative**: This leader takes command and issues orders.

Many leaders incorporate elements of all of these styles. And just as obviously, style 4 isn't going to work well with a fellowship. The leader of a fellowship answers to the members of the fellowship, not to a board of directors, or a corporate head.

## Ideals of Leadership

Here is a list of desirable qualities of leaders in any situation:

1. Willingness to take the job.
2. Willingness to take the responsibilities that come with the job.
3. Has people skills, such as empathy.
4. Has the courage to accept some risk.
5. Is willing to admit when he or she is wrong.
6. Is willing to set aside personal preferences for the good of the group.
7. Is ethical in all their dealings.
8. Understands how all the parts fit together to make the whole.
9. Has humility.
10. Is willing to mentor others to develop leadership in them.
11. Insists on using the democratic method in making group decisions.
12. Is willing to compromise except where principles are concerned.

We know that there are very few leaders who are strong in all these ideals, but every leader should strive to develop these traits. And for the leader/facilitator of a spiritual community, there is one especially important ideal. That ideal concerns the spiritual life of that leader/facilitator. Jesus went aside to consult with his “Father in Heaven” frequently during his life; all spiritual leaders should do likewise. Especially when facing difficult decisions, or at times of group conflict, a leader should take time out to be alone and seek spiritual guidance. In fact, if all leaders, secular as well as spiritual did this, wouldn't it be a much better world?

## Leadership Skills

1. ***Negotiation***: Many times disputes will arise that need to be resolved before the group can move on toward its goals. The leader/facilitator tries to make sure everyone's ideas are heard, and then tries to have all ideas receive fair consideration, and reminds everyone that it's OK to attack ideas, but not persons. When emotions run too high, the leader may use humor to cool everyone down or suggest the matter be deferred so everyone has time to consider all the ideas.
2. ***Dealing With Difficult People***: The leader/facilitator will often be the person who has to resolve problems with difficult people, though the whole group should be involved in this process. The difficult person may be one of the group, or someone outside the group with whom they must deal. The difficult person may be a bad fit for the type of group, may be a disruptive or even mentally ill person, or may be a very needy sort of person. The leader/facilitator and indeed the entire group needs to have compassion for people with problems, but can't let the problems or personality of one individual fully dominate the direction of the group, or even derail the groups' direction and goals. Obviously, if someone has had a death in the family or some other tragedy, the group may for a time be the support group and center of stability for that individual. Indeed, it should be natural for the group to be a support for each member. Wisdom is needed to discern when and how to react to difficult people. 
3. ***Self Control***: Emotions play an important part in group function [^1], but extreme and frequent emotional outbursts can derail serious discussions and problem solving. There are certainly times when strong emotions are appropriate in a group setting, such as in grief for the serious misfortune of a member. The group will be especially sensitive to the emotional tone set by the leader/facilitator, so he/she needs to control his/her emotions appropriately. If the leader constantly resorts to anger when thwarted, anger may be the way group members begin to react to one another.

Leadership is not something that you learn in a weekend seminar, although such seminars can be valuable to those in leadership positions. Many church denominations sponsor leadership training for lay leaders at the district or national level. These are helpful, but only a beginning. Leadership is something learned mainly by hands-on experience. A class on riding a bicycle isn't early as effective as getting on a bicycle and trying to ride it.
