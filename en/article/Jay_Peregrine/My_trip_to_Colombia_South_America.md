_By Jay Peregrine, executive director, Urantia Foundation, Chicago, Illinois, USA_

_Editor's note: Jay and Mo Siegel, the president of Urantia Foundation, attended the April 28-May 2, 2012, Urantia Association International Conference in Medellin, Colombia._

Colombia and Brazil are two of the most religious countries in South America. And Colombia is one of the largest, per capita, Urantia Book reading countries in the world. After all of the problems with drug cartels in the 1980s, Medellin has emerged as a vibrant city with a wonderful climate. It has a beautiful new transportation system, including gondolas which serve hill-side neighborhoods, and it has art museums and thriving industry.

Tamila Ragimova, president of the Colombia association of the Urantia Association International, did an excellent job organizing the conference. There were 15 presentations by Spanish and English speakers. The presentations were simultaneously translated into English and Spanish. In addition, a livestreaming internet video link was provided. Conference attendees spent their afternoons in workshops, where topics were studied in-depth in smaller groups.

In the evenings we were treated to traditional music and dance at the hotel. One night we took a tour of the city in chivas (a chiva is a small, colorfully painted, open-air bus). On the last day of the conference we took a trip into the countryside, visiting a traditional village and having For me, the conference was a time for renewing old friendships and for making new friends in the context of in -depth study and discussion of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It was also an opportunity to experience a beautiful and exciting country-Colombia.
