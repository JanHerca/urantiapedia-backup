Chuck Van Sant
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, U.S.A. 

In the [3-95 edition of the IUA Journal](/en/article/C_L_Van_Sant/Ultimatons), I suggested in my paper about ultimatons that the quarks that scientists have been studying in their particle accelerators are the rings of proton-ultimatons (wimps) that I described there. The discovery of the “top” quark last year shows that this is in error, since the “top” has a mass greater than that of an atom of gold, around 400 times that of the proton.

I made the assumption that the macrocosm was proof of the microcosm, that the ever larger areas of the outer space levels indicated ever larger masses in inner space. A different macrocosm was in effect. I had overlooked one sentence: _It is fashioned after the similitude of the three Gods embraced in one..._ <a id="a41_311"></a>[UB 42:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_6). This indicates three rings of ultimatons in each subatomic particle, proton, neutron, and electron (see figure I ), rather than the four, three, and two that I indicated in my paper.
