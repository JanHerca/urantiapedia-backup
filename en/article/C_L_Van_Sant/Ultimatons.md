By Chuck Van Sant
Bertlesville, Oklahoma, U.S.A.

One of the most difficult sections of _The URANTIA Book_ is Paper 42: Energy-Mind and Matter. But it is amazing how simple its basic message is, once the reader is thoroughly familiar with it, and thoroughly familiar with some of the literature of particle physics.

It is not the content that is difficult but the form, for it is not a scholarly discourse which proves itself through logic, but a mosaic designed to conceal as much as to demonstrate. (It seems that everything good, from the central universe down to Eden, has a wall around it.)

The first and perhaps the most instructive statement on subatomic structure in the paper is that energy (matter) is _... fashioned after the similitude of the three Gods embraced in one, as they function at the headquarters of the universe of universes._ [UB 42:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_6). In other words, each subatomic particle, whether proton, neutron, or electron, is structured on the order of the three concentric circles.

The second rather astounding statement in the Paper is that the ultimaton is the one hundredth part of the electron. If the electron is composed of 100 ultimatons, organized on the order of the three concentric circles, in what way are they distributed? How many rings are there, and how many ultimatons are to be found in each ring?

Logic, common sense, and revelation all declare that there are nine rings of eleven, with one ultimaton at the center, four rings in the outer concentric circle, three rings in the next, two rings in the inner circle, and of course, the one, which we are expected to supply. (See figure 1.)

These startling facts about reality according to _The URANTIA Book_ are paralleled by some inspired guessing about terminology by conventional physicists. The four most important particles of physics, quarks, are called truth, beauty, charm (close enough to be goodness), and strange (love is, after all, the one thing in the universe that science cannot explain—therefore strange—and God, if he is love, still moves in mysterious ways.) Remember that truth, beauty, and goodness are equivalent to love.

But although physicists' intuition in naming the “quarks” is truly unerring, their attempts at interpreting the empirical data are much less so. The basic particles—truth, beauty, and charm—which spread or cluster around strange are not individual spheres, as they believe, but rings of spheres: truth—44; beauty—33, and charm—22, and of course, strange—1.

The relative masses are about right: truth—400 MeV, beauty—300, charm—200, and strange, which, remember, is an isolated central ultimaton—10. Added together, they have a mass close to 938 MeV, that of the proton they are trying to represent. But somehow, no one has noticed this.

The diversity of quark mass is another problem for physicists, yet solved for _URANTIA Book_ readers. Physicists are looking for three or four elementary particles, so they are disconcerted when experiment comes up with a hundred. This has been the most significant problem for particle physics, and the reason for introducing the concept of quarks in the first place.

The fact that science's quarks are actually composites, not single particles, solves the biggest puzzle after-quark mass, the elusiveness of the truth, or top quark. _The loss of one or more ultimatons destroys typical electronic identity..._ [UB 42:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_5). Since the truth-ultimatons are on the outer rings, they are always dispersed in an accelerator, while the inner rings of huddling charm ultimatons often lose their identity as individual particles, and since these clusters of ultimatons are torn apart in a ragged manner, scientists receive various results in the experimental masses of these aggregations.

To return to the matter of the three subatomic particles—neutron, proton, and electron—remember, _The URANTIA Book_ declares that all of these three have the same structure. Each is composed of a hundred particles that have the mass of one hundredth of its parent particle.

Clear, too, is the fact that each of the particles making up an electron has a mass of 0.005 MeV (one hundredth of the electron), and that it must be the uncharged particle that in its free state is _not responsive to linear gravity_. [UB 12:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_5). Physicists call it “not interacting with everyday matter.” Obviously the book is talking about the neutrino.

But if each subatomic particle has this same structure ([UB 42:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_7)), then each proton has 100 ultimatons that are 1 / 100 of its mass: 938 / 100 MeV = 9.38 MeV, and each neutron has 100 ultimatons that are 1 / 100 of its mass: 940 / 100 = 9.40 MeV. (See figure 2.)

It is a circuitous route by which _The URANTIA Book_ has led us here, but it is undeniably true that there are three kinds of ultimatons: electron-ultimatons, which the book speaks of, and then proton-ultimatons and neutron-ultimatons, which it does not.

This raises another question. We have things in the real world on which to hang our electron-ultimaton sign (neutrinos), why not the others? In fact, we do. They are called weakly interacting massive particles-wimps. Like the neutrino, science has not determined their masses, but when they do, they will find that they have masses one hundredth of their parent particles: 9.38 MeV, and 9.40 MeV.

These three, the ultimatons, resolve a number of other problems of physics, astronomy, and cosmology. One of them is with “dark matter.” Scientists in all three fields believe that ninety per cent of the universe is unseen. Other unsolved problems are the low count of solar neutrinos and the “missing mass of the universe.” (We are bombarded by billions of free neutrinos every second. Matter holds no obstacle to a free neutrino. It passes right through. Science does not know yet that _they are responsive only to Paradise gravity_.)

Finally, the attraction of these particles for each other is undoubtedly the powerful force we “know nothing about” on Urantia, and logic suggests an energy proportional to the mass times the cube of light. If splitting the atom involves the square of the speed of light, we might expect that splitting the proton involves its cube. And we do, after all, live in a trinitarian universe. Consider how powerful an energy source this must be, and how universal the fuel. Since we know that ultimatons themselves cannot be converted to pure energy, this must be the most powerful physical force in the seven superuniverses. Just another gift from the revelators.
