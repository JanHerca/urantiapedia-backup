Hello brothers and sisters,

First, I would like to thank the great Urantia source and the Pipeline of Light for making these events on Urantia Possible.

On Wednesday September 1^st^ we had the first meeting to start planning for the August 2020 Urantia Uganda Conference. Moses has been traveling to Uganda since his return home making deliveries of the books he returned to Kampala with.
