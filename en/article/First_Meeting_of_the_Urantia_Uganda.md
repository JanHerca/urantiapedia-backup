Hello brothers and sisters,

First, I would like to thank the great Urantia source and the Pipeline of Light for making these events on Urantia Possible.

On Wednesday September 1^st^ we had the first meeting to start planning for the August 2020 Urantia Uganda Conference. Moses has been traveling to Uganda since his return home making deliveries of the books he returned to Kampala with.

The link to all of the photos I have received is HERE. There is a link on each picture page to download and after clicking the thumbnail to load a larger image click the image again to see the full-size master photo. Simply right click then to save the full-size photo or click the download menu on the page each picture loads in. Thank you for support from Soren Vestergaard, Paula Thompson, André Radatus, Brent St. Denis, Derek Samaras, and Michelle Klimesh with the Pipeline of Light.
