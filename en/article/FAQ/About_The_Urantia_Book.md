## What is The Urantia Book?

_The Urantia Book_ is a revelation of truth for our world from higher beings in the universe. Its teachings blend science, philosophy, history, cosmology and religion seamlessly into a big picture revealing our origin, our purpose, and our divine and eternal destiny, “the agelong process from animal to angel, from angel to spirit, from spirit to God.” _The Urantia Book_, <a id="s24_374"></a>[UB 48:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p8_4)

The teachings include information on the composition, organization, administration, and personalities of the cosmos; the history of our planet; our continuing spiritual evolution; a new view of reality by clarifying the concepts of personality, mind, and soul; the evolutionary experience of our progression towards God in partnership with God’s spirit in our minds; and lastly, an enlarged account of the life and teachings of Jesus.
