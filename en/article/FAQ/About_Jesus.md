## Do you believe Jesus sacrificed his life to save us?

Following are three direct quotes from the book that we feel address your question. The first quote is from Jesus as he spoke to the two brothers from Emmaus, not long after his resurrection. The other two are from sections near the end of the book entitled, _Meaning Of The Death On The Cross_ <a id="s24_295"></a>[UB 188:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_1) and _Lessons From The Cross_. <a id="s24_369"></a>[UB 188:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_1)

> As they walked along, Jesus said to them: "How slow you are to comprehend the truth! When you tell me that it is about the teachings and work of this man that you have your discussions, then may I enlighten you since I am more than familiar with these teachings. Do you not remember that this Jesus always taught that his kingdom was not of this world, and that all men, being the sons of God, should find liberty and freedom in the spiritual joy of the fellowship of the brotherhood of loving service in this new kingdom of the truth of the heavenly Father's love? Do you not recall how this Son of Man proclaimed the salvation of God for all men, ministering to the sick and afflicted and setting free those who were bound by fear and enslaved by evil? Do you not know that this man of Nazareth told his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, be delivered up to his enemies, who would put him to death, and that he would arise on the third day? Have you not been told all this? And have you never read in the Scripture concerning this day of salvation for Jew and gentile, where it says that in him shall all the families of the earth be blessed; that he will hear the cry of the needy and save the souls of the poor who seek him; that all nations shall call him blessed? That such a Deliverer shall be as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. That he will feed the flock like a true shepherd, gathering the lambs in his arms and tenderly carrying them in his bosom. That he will open the eyes of the spiritually blind and bring the prisoners of despair out into full liberty and light; that all who sit in darkness shall see the great light of eternal salvation. That he will bind up the brokenhearted, proclaim liberty to the captives of sin, and open up the prison to those who are enslaved by fear and bound by evil. That he will comfort those who mourn and bestow upon them the joy of salvation in the place of sorrow and heaviness. That he shall be the desire of all nations and the everlasting joy of those who seek righteousness. That this Son of truth and righteousness shall rise upon the world with healing light and saving power; even that he will save his people from their sins; that he will really seek and save those who are lost. That he will not destroy the weak but minister salvation to all who hunger and thirst for righteousness. That those who believe in him shall have eternal life. That he will pour out his spirit upon all flesh, and that this Spirit of Truth shall be in each believer a well of water, springing up into everlasting life. Did you not understand how great was the gospel of the kingdom which this man delivered to you? Do you not perceive how great a salvation has come upon you?" <a id="s26_2734"></a>[UB 190:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_4)

> When once you grasp the idea of God as a true and loving Father, the only concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God as an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished, unless some being almost equal to himself should volunteer to suffer for them, to die as a substitute and in their stead. The whole idea of ransom and atonement is incompatible with the concept of God as it was taught and exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. <a id="s28_696"></a>[UB 188:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_8)

> The cross forever shows that the attitude of Jesus toward sinners was neither condemnation nor condonation, but rather eternal and loving salvation. Jesus is truly a savior in the sense that his life and death do win men over to goodness and righteous survival. Jesus loves men so much that his love awakens the response of love in the human heart. <a id="s30_351"></a>[UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

## Does The Urantia Book teach that Jesus is the Saviour?

Several quotes relate directly to this question:

> Though it is hardly proper to speak of Jesus as a sacrificer, a ransomer, or a redeemer, it is wholly correct to refer to him as a _savior._ <a id="s36_143"></a>[UB 188:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_7)

> Jesus is truly a savior in the sense that his life and death do win men over to goodness and righteous survival. Jesus loves men so much that his love awakens the response of love in the human heart. <a id="s38_202"></a>[UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

Jesus' life among us served to illuminate the way of salvation, but his death was not a ransom paid to appease an offended God. It was, and still is, his life of unselfish service and his revelation of the true and loving nature of our Heavenly Father that illuminated and opened the way of salvation for all who sincerely seek it. Jesus does save us, not from God, but from our own base, ignorant, and selfish natures.

Jesus revealed that each person, by wholeheartedly trusting in the absolute goodness of God as his infinitely-loving Spirit Father, may experience the profoundly personal inner assurance of sonship as the Father's free gift. He once said,

> No child has aught to do with _earning_ the status of son or daughter. The earth child comes into being by the will of its parents. Even so, the child of God comes into grace and the new life of the spirit by the will of the Father in heaven. <a id="s44_245"></a>[UB 144:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_3)

Unselfish service to one's fellows, righteous living for God's sake, and the striving for divine perfection, become, then, man's supreme motivation for living, as opposed to the selfish clamoring for survival. Jesus provided a new way of living which consists in salvation from self. Salvation (survival beyond mortal death) is the gift of God, and should be taken for granted by all who are sincere of heart, who humbly seek God and desire to be like him.

> "When men believe this gospel, which is a revelation of the goodness of God, they will be led to voluntary repentance of all known sin. Realization of sonship is incompatible with the desire to sin." Jesus, <a id="s48_209"></a>[UB 150:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p5_5)

## Who is Jesus?

> Jesus is the spiritual lens in human likeness which makes visible to the material creature Him who is invisible. <a id="s52_115"></a>[UB 169:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p4_13)

> Jesus is truly a savior in the sense that his life and death do win men over to goodness and righteous survival. Jesus loves men so much that his love awakens the response of love in the human heart. <a id="s54_202"></a>[UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

But when Jesus had finished his earth life, this name of the Father had been so revealed that the Master, who was the Father incarnate, could truly say:

> I am the bread of life.
> I am the living water.
> I am the light of the world.
> I am the desire of all ages.
> I am the open door to eternal salvation.
> I am the reality of endless life.
> I am the good shepherd.
> I am the pathway of infinite perfection.
> I am the resurrection and the life.
> I am the secret of eternal survival.
> I am the way, the truth, and the life.
> I am the infinite Father of my finite children.
> I am the true vine; you are the branches.
> I am the hope of all who know the living truth.
> I am the living bridge from one world to another.
> I am the living link between time and eternity.
> 
> Thus did Jesus enlarge the living revelation of the name of God God's Will to all generations. As divine love reveals the nature of God, eternal truth discloses his name in ever-enlarging proportions. <a id="s75_203"></a>[UB 182:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_9)


## What did Jesus do after the age of 12 years until 30 years?

Until the appearance of The Urantia Book. We were all left wondering about all of those years between the time Jesus was found in the Temple, and the beginnings of his public ministry.

Jesus lived an amazing life. As you know, he was a Divine Son of God, incarnated on this planet as a helpless baby. He was truly human as well as truly Divine, and as a human, he lived the same kind of life as all humans live; he was born, he had parents, he had playmates, he went to school, he learned how to work with wood, he played a musical instrument, he was popular with his peers, and, as a young adult, he traveled his world. He was a good student, and a good son; he had brothers and sisters, and became a father-brother to them following Joseph's untimely death when Jesus was but 15 years-old.

He lived a normal, unpretentious kind of a life, along with all the ups and downs that most people are subject to, not unlike that of his contemporaries. And during this physical life that he lived, he also had a rich inner life in which he gradually became aware of who he was and what his true mission on this world was to be. This is, of course, what set Jesus apart from everyone else - then and now. For Jesus discovered at age fourteen just what that mission was to be, and just who he truly was. After that, his whole life was focused upon the ways and means of executing his mission according to the will of his Father in Heaven. But he never abandoned his purely human life, along with all of its responsibilities; he was ever true to the duties that he had as a member of his family, and a upstanding citizen of his community. And at the end of this phase of his life, he was finally able to devote himself wholly to his mission - that of publicly proclaiming the "good news" of man's sonship with God and salvation by faith.

> You'll be happy to know that now you can read the complete story of Jesus' matchless life, including all of those missing years, by going to this link: [The Life and Teachings of Jesus.](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120)

This link will start you off at the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. In this amazing document, you'll read about all of the above times of Jesus' life, and much, much more. Even the events that you have known from reading the Bible are expanded and elaborated - restated for our 21st century times. The message of Jesus' life is so powerful and so life-changing that The Urantia Book states:

> Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it. <a id="s90_118"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3)

That religious life of Jesus started long before his ministry began, and I hope you'll enjoy reading about it in its entirety. Today, as 2000 years ago, Jesus stands as the highest example of a human being living a life dedicated to God. 

In the narrative of Jesus' life, you'll hear Jesus referred to as "Michael" many times, and in order to understand this designation, part of the revealed knowledge of you might want to read the following section of The Urantia Book as well: _The Spirit of Bestowal_. <a id="s94_267"></a>[UB 7:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p5_1)

## Can you tell me why Jesus is called Michael?

Parts I-III of The Urantia Book cover your question in detail, Papers 21 and 33 specifically; also Papers 119 and 120 just prior to the "Times of Michaels’s Bestowal" Paper will help you understand these concepts. You can read these Papers on-line beginning here ( [Paper 21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21); [Paper 33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33); [Paper 119](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119); [Paper 120](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120)) and can listen to them as you read along from our site.

Jesus had existed as a person for countless ages before being born here but we haven’t been given his prior name, Jesus being the English form of the name Joseph and Mary gave their baby. Variations of the name Jesus are what we know him by here on Earth. Michael is not his name, it is a title for an order of celestial beings as it has been coined in the English language. The name Michael is attributed to an archangel in the Bible but that’s due to a confusion of the personalities involved.

## What was the purpose of Jesus' life?

Here are some Urantia Book references that will answer your question. Please click on the links to open up the quote in context:

> "Down here I have taught you in proverbs and spoken to you in parables. I did so because you were only children in the spirit; but the time is coming when I will talk to you plainly concerning the Father and his kingdom. And I shall do this because the Father himself loves you and desires to be more fully revealed to you. Mortal man cannot see the spirit Father; therefore have I come into the world to show the Father to your creature eyes. But when you have become perfected in spirit growth, you shall then see the Father himself." Jesus, <a id="s106_546"></a>[UB 180:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p6_8)

> That which the world needs most to know is: Men are the sons of God, and through faith they can actually realize, and daily experience, this ennobling truth. <a id="s108_160"></a>[UB 193:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_4)

> Jesus was the perfectly unified human personality. And today, as in Galilee, he continues to unify mortal experience and to co-ordinate human endeavors. He unifies life, ennobles character, and simplifies experience. He enters the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it. It is literally true: "If any man has Christ Jesus within him, he is a new creature; old things are passing away; behold, all things are becoming new." <a id="s110_439"></a>[UB 100:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_18)

> Jesus did not live his life on earth in order to set an example for all other human beings to copy. He lived this life in the flesh by the same mercy ministry that you all may live your lives on earth; and as he lived his mortal life in his day and as he was, so did he thereby set the example for all of us thus to live our lives in our day and _as we are_. You may not aspire to live his life, but you can resolve to _live your lives_ even as, and by the same means that, he lived his.
> 
> Jesus is _the new and living way_ from man to God, from the partial to the perfect, from the earthly to the heavenly, from time to eternity.<a id="s114_142"></a>[UB 129:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_7)
