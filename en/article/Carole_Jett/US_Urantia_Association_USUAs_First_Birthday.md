Carole Jett, Secretary USUA

The USUA celebrated its first birthday at the 1996 IUA Conference in Nashville. We brought the cake, lit the candle, and found the flame could not be extinguished. Our President, Rick Brinkman, held a highly attended and very vocal meeting on Friday evening, August 9, where much was accomplished. The atmosphere was ripe with plans and ideas. If we are able to carry out one tenth of them in the coming year, the USUA will be well on the path of an extremely cohesive North American organization. Our first goal is to assist the growth and prosperity of the existing fourteen US Regional Associations. Second, we are in the process of birthing an additional Association in mid-America. And last but not least, USUA will be forming Provisional Associations for the more rural parts of America.

## The USUA Messenger

Our newsletter, The USUA Messenger will be forthcoming every two months. Anyone outside the United States interested in receiving it should contact **Morris Kaplowitz, 11512 Hearthstone Court, Reston, Virginia 22091,email: mokap@nicom.com**.

In closing, the USUA was blessed with many who gave donations and conference reservation money. We far surpassed our fund raising expectations, a fund raising effort that only materialized the second day into the conference. Someone out there is looking after us. Thank you! His love is boundless and shines through the eyes and lives in the hearts of us lowly individual mortals.
