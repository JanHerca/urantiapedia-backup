Let's put this subject to rest, as in rest in peace, once and for all. _The URANTIA Book_ does this so well. Among the so-called channelers and their devotees, there are individual differences, but the main premise that they all adhere to is as follows: The Lucifer rebellion has been adjudicated. Urantia is no longer under quarantine. Therefore, the channelers, individual human personalities, are now receiving messages from various beings, and this constitutes the restoration of the universal broadcasts. _Broadcast_ is the key word here.

In [Paper 67, “The Planetary Rebellion,”](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67) the subject of the interruption of the broadcasts is being discussed:

> _It should be recorded that, when Van appealed to the Most Highs of Edentia after Lucifer had sustained Caligastia on Urantia, the Constellation Fathers dispatched an immediate decision sustaining Van on every point of this contention. This verdict failed to reach him because the planetary circuits of communication were severed while it was in transit. Only recently was this actual ruling discovered lodged in the possession of a relay energy transmitter where it had been marooned ever since the isolation of Urantia. Without this discovery, made as the result of the investigations of the Urantia midwayers, the release of this decision would have awaited the restoration of Urantia to the constellation circuits. And this apparent accident of interplanetary communication was possible because energy transmitters can receive and transmit intelligence, but they cannot initiate communication._ [UB 67:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_9)


It seems quite clear that universal broadcasts work in a somewhat similar manner as our earthly broadcasts — non-personal.
