One day, the vocations that sustain our living will also honor our souls. Angie is building bridges, today, toward that eventuality.

Angie learned about God from loving parents who are lifelong truth seekers, and she grew up in the midst of Urantia Book discussion. She figured out her own perspective, however, once she was in the working world and faced health issues. What started as a five-minute, leap of faith attempt to communicate with God grew into a feeling of peace and joy and fullness of being she had never experienced before.

That uplifted attitude accompanied her into Harvard Divinity School where she felt the call to spark the imagination of others to find their own relationships with God. Angie understood her generation. She knew that her peers felt a degree of religious disaffiliation: they didn't identify with the established religious institutions. Her investigation revealed that some of the most popular classes at Harvard, Yale, and Stanford focused on how to live a good life and where to find the resources to do so. She realized that young people's detachment from standard religious options was actually a reality response. What they were looking for was a personally meaningful community in which they could grow.

As a grad student, Angie cited the Urantia Book in her coursework, ran a study group, wrote a musical about Jesus and his baby sister, and arranged weekly worship sessions. She felt a responsibility to do what she could and not worry about her reputation. She was keenly aware that academia afforded her a unique platform from which to speak and a potentially intolerant climate to withstand. She wishes she had Jesus' impeccable ability to speak truth in the vernacular of those listening.

Angie now works with a team to foster community for spiritual deepening for those who don't share a religious affiliation or a coherent set of practices and beliefs. They work in many venues including business settings where people want to align their values with their work.

We are invited to contribute, she tells us, and it's fun to put Jesus' teachings into a new portrayal that sparks the imagination! She promotes the message that good cheer can be a counterpoint to despair, anxiety, anger, and the idea so many have of being valueless. She asks us to be courageous as we contribute our effort to the plan. Even if we fall short, the whole game doesn't fall apart. “Michael has got this! We are so supported and so loved!”
