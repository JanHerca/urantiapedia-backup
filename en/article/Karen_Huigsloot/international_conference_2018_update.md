**Jesus as a Teacher: Are You Ready to Live His Teachings in the 21st Century?**

How did Jesus develop as a true teacher? What methods did he apply, both then and now? And what are the most important lessons he wanted to teach us so that we, as we can read in Paper 195, can develop ourselves as new leaders? That is as spiritual men and women, fully trusting in the teaching of Jesus.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> _But paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack of a new vision of the Master’s life on earth. A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment._ <a id="a47_524"></a>[[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)]

> _Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus’ religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men. And then will these spirit-born souls quickly supply the leadership and inspiration requisite for the social, moral, economic, and political reorganization of the world._ <a id="a49_591"></a>[[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)]

The program will provide space for seven plenary speakers, readers of _The Urantia Book_ who have studied the book for many years and who can help us to better understand this Fifth Revelation. The emphasis of the program will be based on learning through experience and exchanges in small groups.

The language spoken during the conference will be English, but we are offering simultaneous translations for Spanish (by Serapis Murillo) and French (by Christopher Moseley.)

During the coming months, the program will be further developed and we will keep you posted on this website.

### A Renewed Intention

We have been challenged to set up this conference in a completely different way. More speakers will appear before you with a short presentation (10 to 15 minutes.) After each presentation participants sit together in small groups (that have been assigned in advance) to engage themselves in the subject addressed by the speaker, the so-called break-out sessions.

### Fixed Groups

We have designed this conference based on _The Group Dynamic Model_ suggested to us by David Linthicum. Participants are assigned to a group by the conference organizers and will stay together every day of the conference. These permanent groups consist of about eight people. The reason for this method is for everyone to achieve a deeper study and insight into _The Urantia Book_.

For those who have special reasons for wanting to the same group with a particular person, they can contact the conference organizers.

### In-Depth Study

The presenters provide assignments—cross references and/or questions for group discussion—which are intended to lead to new and deeper understandings and experiences in order to connect the advanced concepts of _The Urantia Book_ with everyday life. Each group works on the same assignments, this being in accordance with a study technique developed by George Michelson Dupont from France.

### Maximum Participation

By combining the model of fixed groups with the method of in-depth study, all attendees are invited to participate in the process and all will have equal possibility to express their individual thoughts and to give their input.

### Workshops

On Saturday afternoon there will be rotating workshops. Participants may indicate in advance which workshops they wish to attend. Workshops and workshop leaders are expected to be presented on the website by the end of the year; thereafter participants may register for their choice. Workshop placement is limited, so keep an eye on it!

### Social Contacts

Between presentations and group work, much space has been left for socializing and networking to meet old and new friends and acquaintances. There are a number of other possibilities like walking along the bulb fields, working-out in the gym, taking a dip in the swimming pool or just relaxing before the next session starts.

### Entertainment

On both Friday and Saturday night performances have been scheduled by professional artists. On Friday evening [Iris Kroes](http://www.uai2018.org/program/entertainment/iris/en) entertains us with a harp and vocal performance. Saturday [Pato Banton](http://www.uai2018.org/program/entertainment/pato/en) and [Antoinette Hall](http://www.uai2018.org/program/entertainment/antoinette/en) will treat us to their special performance.

If you’re planning to go to Urantia Association’s International Conference in Amsterdam, The Netherlands next year, we urge you to book your accommodation in the hotel now! A lot of activities take place in the region surrounding the conference venue at that time of the year, so it is very important to book your accommodation early to insure you secure a room.

All information for the conference can be found on our website: [www.uai2018.org](https://urantia-association.org/international-conference-2018-update/www.uai2018.org). On this website you can also register for the conference and book your room.

We hope to meet you next year in Amsterdam.

Jaap Terra and, President of the Urantia Association of the Netherlands (UAISUN)
