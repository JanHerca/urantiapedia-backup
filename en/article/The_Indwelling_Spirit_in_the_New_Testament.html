The Indwelling Spirit in the New Testament.

I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, nor knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you. (John 14:16-17)

At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. (John 14: 20)

If a man loves me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him. (John 14:23)

Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me. (John 15: 4)

I am the vine, you are the branches: He that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. (John 15: 5)

For the kingdom of God is within you. (Luke 17:21)

For it is not you that speaks, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you. (Matthew 10: 20)

And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us. (1 John 3:24)

No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us. (1 John 4:12)

Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
(1 John 4:13)

Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.
(1 John 4:15)

And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him. (1 John 4:16)

But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwells in you.
(Romans 8: 9)

But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you. (Romans 8:11)

Those who are led by God's spirit are God's sons. For the spirit that God has given you does not make you sinners and cause you to be afraid; instead the spirit makes you God's children and by the spirit's power we cry out to God, Abba, Father. God's spirit joins himself to our spirits to declare we are God's children. (Romans 8:14-16)

Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
(1 Cor. 3:16)

What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own? (1 Cor. 6: 19)

Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you. (2 Cor. 13: 5)

To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. (Colossians 1:27)

He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. (1 Thessalonians 1: 8)

That good thing which was committed unto you, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us. (2 Timothy 1:14)

And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. (Galatians 4:6)
