## Spirit of Truth - Karo Kanye Akamune 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxmnKFBItzU

“Halleluiah!” Karo's greeting sparks with the vitality of a man overflowing with the spirit of Love. He was born into a Christian family in Nigeria, and new revelations awaited him as he pursued his university studies in Trinidad and Tobago. How might degrees in computer science and business lead to revelation and eventually, to becoming a pastor? The answer has much to do with Karo's response to "a desire I couldn't explain" to learn about Melchizedek. In addition to his regular curriculum, Karo devoted months, then years to finding out who Melchizedek really was.

## Spirit of Truth - Kwadjo Spiri

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luSu0iy9fpg

Some people stumble into spirituality. Kwadjo charted his nonstop course directly to God. Hungry for truth, he integrated what he learned about the universe and voraciously sought more. As a university student in St. Petersburg, he discovered the Urantia Book at the peak of his spiritual search. Notwithstanding a demanding engineering curriculum, Kwadjo read the book cover to cover, in six months. After graduation, he returned to Ghana and then really got serious about spiritualizing his mind.

## Spirit of Truth - Pato Banton 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v_=tyYMW4dlH4

Pato is a present-day apostle who nourishes spiritual orphans with the welcoming message that they are children of a loving father who encourages their unqueness. He grew up in a musical family and little religious structure. This context offered free rein to his inner voice and insatiable curiosity. Involved early with the Caribbean music scene in England, Pato observed its evolution from mento, to blue beat, to ska, to rocksteady.
