Oh Mother! Oh Your people! Oh! Your planet that glows blue of Lapis lazuli. Spring forth this day: your day. The day we forever acknowledge you and your infinite love that is the sweet air we breathe. Sweet spirit of all that is natural and good, thank you for your patience, thank you for your compassion, thank you for the breath of life that speaks this hymn of gratitude to you, the great mother of spirit.

Bless your children mother. Bless your fields that nourish them. Teach us your ways of compassion and cooperation with all things natural and life giving. Help the children to recognize your spiritual signature. Help them to see your kind face that forever shines brightly in the sky above and the earth below. Bless you mother, for your sky is our temple and within this great temple we are one family. May the spirit of truth forever assist you in your endless service to the children of time, both near and far.

Oh spirit of truth! Oh brave brother of mercy and loyalty!

Teach your children to be curious in the ways of self-knowledge, and in this lesson reveal the mother to her orphaned children. Teach her sons the ways of her works. Introduce her sweet voice that has been patiently waiting inside their broken hearts.  Oh Mother of Spirit! Oh sweet healing hands of mercy and growth.

Your children search for you and do not find you. They cover your planet to hear your voice. They turn every stone to find your touch. Knowing not that you are the stone. Help us to turn the stone inside ourselves. Help us to know you, as you are inside the hearth of our omnipotent companionship. Balance us mother. Heal our trauma. Teach us the tender dance of divinity with the spirit of truth. Meet us now, we wish to know you as you are.

Oh! Great Spirit of all!

You are the first and last. You alone are the source of all that is true, beautiful, and good. Thank you on this day of the mother. Thank you for the mother. May all the beings in your divine creation aid her in the sublime service she so masterfully executes for her children of space and time. Help us father to be courageous in our honesty and compassionate in our character. Please father, refresh our minds and renew our spirits. Help us to be aware of self and others. Help us to reconnect with the eternal loving personality that is the mother of us all.

Oh Bless you Mother!

My sweet river of tolerance, My Mountain of mercy, My endless field of kind understanding. Your winds sing inspiration. Your beauty pierces the haze of indecision like the dove soars gracefully across the dawn filled sky, forever silhouetted in the hearts of her affectionate audience.
