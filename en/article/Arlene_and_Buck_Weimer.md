## Bio

Arlene was a good Jewish girl from Brooklyn and Buck was a rebellious guy from a small town in Pennsylvania when they met on a Caribbean island in 1964. They married in 1970, traveled extensively, and then settled in Pueblo, CO, in 1974. Along with co-creating three sons (Jon, Matt, and Adam, now adults) they established careers: Arlene as a psychologist and Buck as a Clinical Therapist at a local hospital. They have been readers of _The Urantia Book_ and devoted to its teachings since 1972.

Arlene and Buck Weimer have been students of _The Urantia Book_ since 1972 and have been involved in many and various wonderful study groups over the years. They raised three sons to adulthood in Pueblo, Colorado, while working at their respective careers as therapists. They view their youthful travels as a period of training for the dedication they feel for international outreach of the revelation.
