## Bio

Arlene was a good Jewish girl from Brooklyn and Buck was a rebellious guy from a small town in Pennsylvania when they met on a Caribbean island in 1964. They married in 1970, traveled extensively, and then settled in Pueblo, CO, in 1974. Along with co-creating three sons (Jon, Matt, and Adam, now adults) they established careers: Arlene as a psychologist and Buck as a Clinical Therapist at a local hospital. They have been readers of _The Urantia Book_ and devoted to its teachings since 1972.
