(Submitted posthumously as Mark is on his way to Mansonia)<br>
<br>
Happy Trails<br>
Divine Love<br>
Take care siblings; be of good cheer.<br>
Life is too precious to worry and fear.<br>
Just know you are loved forever so dear.<br>
Sailor Son on the Mother Ship,<br>
The Sails Are Set,<br>
The Captain Is Aboard with The Pilot at the helm.<br>
Faith is to your Personal Religion as Sails are to a Ship . . .<br>
Let the spirit breeze through your sails ...<br>
Let your Pilot set the course and steer your ship or soul,<br>
along its Internal (Personal),<br>
Infinite (Spirit) Journey,<br>
to the attainment of the Creator (Son)<br>
and on to the Universal (Father).<br>
