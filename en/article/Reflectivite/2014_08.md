## THE FORUM REBELLION

_Gilles Brien_
_Laval_

***Part Two — of Two***

At first, the Shermans were warmly welcomed by the other members of the Forum. People admired Harold for his many accomplishments and his successes in publishing. Dr. Sadler and the other members of the contact committee quickly became friends and were put at ease by the Shermans. This brief honeymoon period ended when Harold began to question the doctor's publishing plans. And also the planned organization of the “Urantia Brotherhood,” the branch of the Foundation that would look after the readers, while the Foundation would look after the book.

By presenting his ideas to the other members of the forum, Harold Sherman gained the support of the majority. They then asked Dr. Sadler that the Forum be allowed to have a greater say in the future developments around the L.U. Almost all the members signed a petition which was delivered to Dr. Sadler.

The doctor responded by meeting with the petitioners in his office, one by one, asking them to withdraw their names, claiming that he had received a message from heaven that the Shermans were rebels. He reportedly warned the signatories that if they sided with the Shermans, they would be treated as such, i.e., outcasts. By forcing the forum members to choose between him and the Shermans, the majority would have withdrawn their names.

Shunned by most of their former colleagues and friends at the forum, in which they continued to participate, but without the right to speak, they remained in Chicago for five years. Sherman believed in the truth and origin of the Urantia revelations and continued to fraternize with his buddy Harry Loose. Throughout this time, the Shermans stood up to Sadler. They continued to come to the forum meetings on Sundays and continued to record what was said and done at each meeting they attended. This effort resulted in hundreds of pages of testimonies that depict forum life with an incomparable vividness and a sense of being there, among the other members of the forum. All is available at the following address: [Sherman Diaries](https://squarecircles.com/the-urantia-diaries/)

In 1947, Harold and Martha moved from Chicago to their 140-acre farm in Arkansas, where Harold continued to write books on spiritualism and the afterlife.

The only reference Harold made in his books to The Urantia Book is in a paperback book, published in 1976, entitled “How to Know What to Believe?” In chapter 5, entitled “Pipeline to God,” he gives a very abbreviated account of his five years in Chicago, in which the names of the _Urantia Book_ and all the members of the forum are changed. When the book was published, the incident of the petition was made a little more public and known to new generations of Urantia Book readers, curious to know the mysterious origins of this incredible book.

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

Hello everyone. I hope you are having a great summer.

**“Inspiration of the moment”**

I would like to start a new section in Réflectivité that could be called “Inspiration of the Moment.” It would contain **YOUR** quotes <ins>**spiritual inspirations**</ins>. (NOT quotes from “The Urantia Book,” or inspirations from other people.)

I would accumulate them and when I had two or more I could bring them out, depending on the space available.

Do you ever wake up at night ... and have one (1) short, simple and very wise sentence running through your head? Or do you ever talk to someone about a subject and suddenly you are surprised by the great depth of a sentence you just said? In short, one (1) sentence spontaneously comes to you that you want to write down. I invite you to share them.

Send me your “magic phrases”, your “bubbles of inspiration”, your “inspirations of the moment”. Thank you.

**Testimony**

I received a (verbal) comment from a reader of Réflectivité who said he much preferred articles that contained more personal opinions than quotes from The Urantia Book. Sometimes the opposite happens. He added that he reads Réflectivité much more to make contact with people's personal opinions than with The Urantia Book.

---

It is true that we remember personal testimony more than intellectual content.

Moreover, if a story contains lived spirituality, we will also remember the values transmitted in this story.

It makes you think about our deep, innate relationship with the personality(ies) and the spiritual.

I thought I would pass the information on to you for your consideration.

Happy reading. $\square$

## Comment received from a reader (Robert Cadienx)

Good morning,

This July edition is particularly interesting. What a pleasure for the soul. And, what a beautiful tool the Réflectivité is.
With pleasure

Thank you Robert. Your appreciation goes back to all those who contributed to the July Réflectivité. $\square$

## Symposium on study groups

(from June 11 to 15, 2014)

_Marcel Laporte_
_Ste-Marcelline-de-Kildare_

This symposium, organized by the UAI in collaboration with the Urantia Foundation and other American organizations related to the “Urantia Book”, brought together a large number of participants (more than 80) having in common the dissemination of the teachings of the “Urantia Book” by the Study Groups.

Here are my impressions and observations of this event. I was surprised by the diversity of participants/readers at this international conference: Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Russia, France, 5 to 6 states from the US, and 7 from Quebec.

The schedule was well structured and the activities varied. Each day included a period of personal meditation, early in the morning in the chapel.

The first day was the gathering at the office to inform readers. Followed by the welcome speech of the President of the UAI, Chris Wood. Then, we were given the schedule of all the activities, the locations on the campus and all useful information.

The main daily activity consisted of several groups of 8 people, each in a room, in order to analyze texts and respond to them.

The conferences were transmitted live on the web by Gaétan Charland. The screens, videos and PowerPoints were operated by Normand Laperle. It was a success.

Here are my thoughts and impressions following this Symposium. I really felt a very positive energizing current. In group work, I appreciated everyone's exchanges on their experiences and difficulties.

The presentations of the speakers were, for the most part, interesting. However, one of the most dynamic and motivating was that of our president Gaétan Charland, on the importance of the mission of the study groups in the dissemination of the teachings of “The Urantia Book”. To be a living example of the teachings!

I was delighted to hear presenters with masters and doctorates contributing to the collective effort of this teaching and dissemination.

At every meal, it was an opportunity to meet and exchange with other readers, our experiences regarding the discovery of “The Urantia Book”, how this book changed our existence and how this transformation resulted in involvement in service in one way or another.

I was impressed to see photos of study groups from every continent. (34 countries out of 186)

I appreciated the collection of texts (in English) from the speakers as well as a brief description of their background.

The logistics were very good. The session went great. The student residences were good.

I left the conference with a sense of belonging to a very special project to which I am committed with conviction, to change the world one person at a time and one group at a time.

Fraternally,
a Urantian.

## The enchanted garden

_Sylvère Marcoux_
_Thetford Mines_

When you enter some gardens, it is not very pleasant, it is even worrying. It is not pleasant to see old trees with broken or twisted branches. It is not like a young garden where everything is in bloom on vigorous bushes. No, these gardens have aged and often they have been poorly maintained, but if you enter them, you can hear voices that tell stories, voices that question, voices that complain, voices that no longer remember. There are also silent voices that would like to be heard. Voices waiting for an answer or a question. Some voices are pleasant, others not. In these gardens if you listen carefully, you will hear very beautiful stories and sometimes a bit of wisdom.

By returning often to the same garden, a magic happens; the old trees come closer to us and bewitch us with their presence. They make us magicians and fairies. It is very pleasant to be a magician or a fairy. You are then destined to receive a lot of love because you have given it. Do not be surprised that strangers recognize you because of what you give off, because of the light that shines in you. These strangers will seek your company and you will receive many smiles as you pass by. This bewitchment will have changed your life.

There are also smaller gardens where you can see a lone tree bending its head as if to examine the ground where it will soon lie down. There are also these two trees whose roots and branches have been intertwined for a long time.

Every garden needs apprentice fairies and apprentice magicians. These old trees love the mints you hide in your bag. $\square$

## Study Groups 101

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

When a new reader of “The Urantia Book” arrives in a study group, he discovers that there is a whole “community of readers” well structured around this book. He discovers the **Foundation** which takes care of the **container**, that is to say the book, the protection of copyrights, the translations, the distribution and the sale, and he discovers the **Association** which takes care of the **content**, that is to say the study of the revelation contained in “The Urantia Book”. Finally, there are the **study groups** which are individual readers who meet to study this content.

It should also be noted that the **Foundation has no legal rights over the Association**, the latter is not accountable to the Foundation for its activities, but in practice the two often join forces to carry out joint activities. It should also be noted that **the Association has no legal rights over the study groups**, the latter is not accountable to the Association for its activities, but in practice the two often join forces to carry out joint activities. Each **study group** could, for example, decide internally on its own rules of conduct without being required to be accountable to the Association.

_There is nothing very restrictive or controlling in this structure_. And that is good. It is a structure where we allow everyone to be master of their own development, where we encourage listening and respect for others and where exchange is omnipresent.

A study group is much more than a group of individual readers gathered together to help each other understand and deepen the content of “The Urantia Book.” Taken as a whole, study groups contain a dormant potential that is still untapped, while respecting the principles stated above.

To understand, we must go back to the [“Publication Mandate”](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) (http://www.urantia-canada.org/francais/le-livredurantia/le-mandat-de-publication.html) that came to us, a little before the first publication of “The Urantia Book” in 1955, by the same source (the revelators) and the same technique as the documents of “The Urantia Book”. This message tells us, among other things, that “_The Book belongs to the time that will immediately follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. [...] When the chaos of the present confusion has dissipated, it will be more possible to design the architecture of a new and improved era of human relations. It is for this better order of things on earth that the Book has been made available._” So, the book was written for later.

**But then why was the Urantia Book released so early?** The answer is contained in the following paragraph: “_An early release of the Book has been offered so that it may be available ***for the training of leaders and teachers***. Its availability is ***also*** required to attract the attention of wealthy people who may then be induced to ***provide resources*** for ***translation*** into other languages._”.

I would like you to pay attention to the word “also” in the second sentence. It demonstrates that “training leaders and teachers” is a priority.

I would also like to draw your attention to the word “training” before “leaders and teachers”. This means that we are considering some kind of supervision, rather than letting things go.

**But where will these leaders and teachers come from?** The mandate answers: “Thousands of study groups must be established.” This is the method advocated by the revelators, the very ones who provided us with “The Urantia Book.” Again, I would like to draw your attention to the word “of” and the “s” in thousands. No specific number is given. The word “of” is to be understood as “many.” In the original English version, it is “thousands.”

---

A study group is a foundation, much like a family is a foundation in our societies. This is where newcomers to the reading community begin, where they discover how this community works and how everyone can benefit from this association.

Upon entering a study group, the new reader will gradually move from **reader**, to **student**, to **seeker**, to **living the teachings** of “The Urantia Book”, to **commitment** coming from oneself, in service to others...out of love, and finally to **doing the will of the Father**.

Somewhere along the way, the person will experience being a teacher and leader...in spite of themselves.

Do you understand the potential of “study groups”? We need to see, in study groups, beings growing towards their full potential. We need to imagine _a non-binding way_ to facilitate this process of ascension, so that all can benefit from it.

As we speak, study groups are, for all practical purposes, very unstructured. The Association offers, free of charge, structured support at all levels of their activities. But clearly, more needs to be done.

The Madison symposium is a good example of one of the many efforts the Association has made in this regard.

**Question**: Where do we want to go from here?

I'll leave you to ponder this question. I encourage anyone to react, adding their two cents, however small. $\square$

THIS ACTIVITY ALLOWS MULTIPLE READERS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important practice helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
