## Adoration: The Father's Gentleness

HEAVENLY AND ALMIGHTY FATHER, FRIEND OF MY EARTHLY DAYS AND AUTHOR OF MY ETERNITY, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HEAVENLY PERSONALITIES WHO HAVE WORKED TO GIVE US THIS 5TH REVELATION; IT ALLOWS US TO BROADEN OUR SPIRITUAL VISION, TO HAVE A CLEARER INSIGHT OF YOUR MAGNIFICENT PERSONALITY.

As I delve deeper into the writings of The Urantia Book, I understand more and more how you are a being of immeasurable generosity, distributing the infinite riches of your potentiality to all creation. You share the direction of the universe with your fellow beings, the eternal Son and the infinite spirit, and you treat them as equals. You delegate to your creatures the maximum of responsibilities, thus allowing them to grow in knowledge and wisdom so that they may respond to your invitation, “Be ye perfect, even as I am perfect.” You thus invite each of us to share in your eternity.

I know that you love and seek this contact with your creation. I know that you do not live alone in your magnificence, that despite your omnipotence and great wisdom, you desire to share the solitude and imperfection of your creatures, making each of us citizens of a friendly universe, members of the spiritual brotherhood of the sons and daughters of God. You do not abandon us to our isolation, but you break it by integrating us into this great and magnificent family of the children of God. The plan that you have created gives all creatures, at least those who truly desire it, the possibility of coming to find you where you are. I am moved by what you have prepared for each of us, for all the creatures of your immense universe.

This creative project that you have undertaken clearly demonstrates your desire to share the riches of your universe with all creation. You make available to us all possible resources so that we can reach you. We are truly the heirs of a Father whose kindness and generosity are limitless. The love and compassion that you show for each of your children are boundless. I remember this parable of Jesus, that of the prodigal son. After asking for his share of the inheritance and spending it recklessly, he finds himself penniless in a faraway country where famine is raging. After realizing his mistake, he says to himself: “I will return to my father and ask him to take me back as a simple employee, because I am no longer worthy of being his son.” He is still far from home when his father sees him approaching. Immediately, he runs to his son who kneels down saying: “Father, I have sinned against Heaven and against you, I am no longer worthy to be called your son.” The father picks him up with an embrace, dresses him in a new robe and organizes a party to celebrate the return of his son... How can one not be touched by such an eloquent demonstration of the generosity of your love? If all your Urantian children could understand how much you love them, they could no longer resist your affection. I want to thank you for your incarnate son, Michael, who has given us, through this short story, such a touching revelation of yourself.

Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for the presence and guidance of your adjuster. Another proof of your great liberality. I know that I can trust him. I know that, through him, you speak constantly to my soul. The trials that mark my path are not the punishments of a God angry at my faults, but rather opportunities to do better and thus progress in grace, in truth and in beauty. For this is what you want, that we grow so that one day, we can stand in your divine presence, in Paradise! You take care of each of us, you speak to us constantly through the events of our life, the normal circumstances of our existence. You show us the way to follow by provoking the multiple decisions that we must make in the face of sometimes distressing challenges. I know that, by this process, you seek to make each of your children courageous and strong beings, sons and daughters in your likeness. I know that in these difficult times we can always count on your presence and support.

You are already preparing us for the service of the Third Age, the age of the outer universes, by developing now, in each of us, the qualities that will allow us to accomplish this service. What can I say to you, except that I am amazed by the care you lavish on us, by the love you have for us, and by the wisdom of a plan that allows our personal growth while preparing for the next age of the universe.

A shelter is provided in case of rain.

## COMMENTS

FOLLOWING THE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE MAY-JUNE RÉFLECTIVITÉ, “YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH” BY LINE ST-PIERRE, HERE ARE SOME COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM READERS.

July 15, 2010

Thank you Gaétan and Line for sharing with us, via Tidings/Réflectivité, some thoughts on the experiences you had during your wonderful trip to South America!

He is so happy to hear of brothers and sisters having the same spiritual fever to propagate the teachings of The Urantia Book and he will be so happy when all humanity becomes aware of the greatest gift given to our world in modern times, a divine gift for the greatest happiness of present and future generations.

Thank you God and thank you for your respective testimonies.

See you next time, at Michael's Feast.

Louise Sauvé, Ormstown

June 30, 2010

Good morning!

I just read the May-June Tidings and in particular Rick Lyon's article in which he recounts the portion of the trip where he accompanies you.

Bravo Line for the article Vosotros sois la sal de la tierra — another underlying aspect that I found interesting in the article. The role of women in general. Our dear Western world often relegates the role of women to the background, as if it were self-evident — while the role of women is more often than not, crucial in many areas.

Thanks for the trip reports.

Herrol Dallaire,
St-Felicien

## Bahá'u'lláh

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2010/006.jpg">
</figure>

“Be generous in times of prosperity,
and in adversity never ceases to give thanks.

Earn your neighbor's trust
and only looks at him with a friendly, smiling face.

Be a treasure to the poor, exhort the rich,
answer the call of the needy
and preserve the sacredness of your promises.

Judge fairly and be circumspect in your speech.

Don't be unfair to anyone.
and shows complete humility towards everyone.

Be a lamp to those who walk in darkness,
a source of joy for the sad one,
be a sea to the thirsty and a refuge to the afflicted,
be a support and defender
for the one who is a victim of oppression.

May honesty and integrity characterize all your actions.

Be a home for the stranger,
a balm for the suffering
and constant support for the fugitive.

Lend your eyes to the blind
and be a guide to him who goes astray.

Be an ornament on the face of truth,
a crown encircling the brow of fidelity,
a pillar of the temple of righteousness,
a breath of life into the body of humanity,
a standard for the armies of justice,
a star on the horizon of virtue,
a dew on the soil of the human heart,
an ark on the ocean of knowledge,
a sun in the sky of generosity,
a gem on the diadem of wisdom,
a shining dunghill in the firmament of your generation,
a fruit in the tree of humility."

Bahá'u'lláh
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Dare, commit yourself...

LACK OF COMMITMENT IS WHAT LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES.

In the Reserve Corps of Destiny, we recruit those who are willing to engage in the scene of temporal action... because to love is to serve.

In conclusion, don't wait until you have everything you need before making a service decision... because you might miss a great opportunity to serve! Dare, commit yourself and the rest will come.

(LIVING WITH AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT)

The favors and disgraces seem alarming.

High ranks greatly afflict you.

Why are favors and disfavors alarming?

Seeking favors from others is degrading:
Alarming when you get them.
Alarming when you lose them.

Why do high ranas afflict you?
The reason is that we have a lot of problems
because we have a self.
Without me, what problems could we have?

Wasting energy on acquiring rare items slows down the growth of the individual.

The true self of man is eternal,
and yet he thinks: I am this body and I will soon die.
If we had no body, what calamities could we fear?

He who sees himself in all things, is made to be the guardian of the world.
He who loves himself as he loves everyone else, is made to be the master of the world.
