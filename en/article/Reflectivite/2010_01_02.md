## The Place of _The Urantia Book_ in Our Spiritual Growth

ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES OF JESUS WAS THIS SUBLIME BALANCE THAT HE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN BETWEEN HIS PHYSICAL, INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES.

The harmony of a personality is revealed by the balance of its components. Just as science and religion must complement each other, the efforts of understanding by the intellect must be accompanied by the understanding of the heart and take shape in practical exercise and teaching. The questions that one asks of others must be complemented by the questions that one asks of oneself and flourish in a sharing of understandings. A balance between doubt and faith is also necessary. Doubt being the spice that gives flavor to man's faith, he will always need it to stimulate his spiritual growth.

There is nothing that man can acquire without effort. In this spirit, our efforts to answer our questions are commendable and essential. Where it becomes problematic is when we want to give ourselves definitive answers. Over time, these become dogmas and subsequently prevent the progression of our thought.

The coming of the Urantia Book fits perfectly into the path of human evolution, an evolution that the Revelators have taken great care to respect. This Book was not given to us to provoke a revolution, but rather to ensure continuity of evolution. The five epochal Revelations are stages of growth and have been well planned.

_The Urantia Book_ is not responsible for our growth, which depends on the efforts of each individual and can only be obtained by our attempts to promote the growth of others. _The Urantia Book_ brings us knowledge, but not truth. Truth is much more than that. It is a living relationship that we have with our Creator. It cannot be taught or learned. It must be lived in action. _The Urantia Book_ also does not bring us faith, because faith does not come from knowledge. What The Urantia Book brings us is an increased sensitivity to spiritual realities, by revealing them to us.

## Theme on the EGO

HELLO TO ALL THE READING MEMBERS OF THE _URANTIA BOOK_ IN QUEBEC AND ELSEWHERE. AT THE HOTEL LE DAUPHIN IN DRUMMONDVILLE, ON FEBRUARY 6, AFTER THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE URANTIA ASSOCIATION OF QUEBEC, A THEME ON THE EGO TOOK PLACE IN THE AFTERNOON. The only speaker was Gaétan Charland, president of the AUQ. His talk on the ego included three approaches, namely psychology, philosophy and spirituality. The presentation was supported by slides that supported his statements as much as possible. Contrary to the generally held opinion that considers the ego as a negative part of our being, the path taken by Gaétan considered the ego as a vital stage that must be transcended like the cocoon is to the butterfly. It translates as the transfer of identity from the human self to the spiritual self. There is divine wisdom in that!

After this superb presentation, the audience divided into round tables of about eight people exchanged on the theme of the presentation. Then, a plenary closed the event.

It was with immense gratitude that the audience thanked Gaétan Charland for his superb presentation which included colors of unpublished truth on the EGO.

Guy Laporte,
Vice-President of AUQ

## ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

FROM FEBRUARY 6, 2010

IT WAS AT THE HOTEL LE DAUPHIN IN DRUMMONDVILLE THAT THE URANTIA ASSOCIATION OF QUEBEC HELD THIS ANNUAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN THE MORNING.

Three important topics were on the agenda:
- a) Changes to the AUQ statutes and regulations, to comply with the AUI regulations and meet the requirements of our mission.
- b) Increase of $10 in membership fees, starting in 2011, to better support the costs incurred by our mission.
- c) Election to the AUQ Council, to the positions of vice-president and treasurer.

The first two were adopted unanimously and no other candidates ran in the elections. The two incumbent candidates, Guy Laporte and Alain Cyr, agreed to be reappointed to their respective positions for another two-year term, due to lack of opposition. A round of applause for these two mandarins for their greatly appreciated offer of service.

The composition of the AUQ Board of Directors for the year 2010 is therefore retained and is as follows:

- President: Gaétan Charland
- Vice-president: Guy Laporte
- Secretary: Maurice Migneault
- Treasurer: Alain Cyr
- Responsible for the members and communications committee: Line St-Pierre

## I plead guilty

DEAR FRIENDS OF THE URANTIA ASSOCIATION OF QUEBEC, I AM GUILTY! OF HAVING MENTIONED IN THE LAST ISSUE OF TIDINGS THAT YOUR MEMBERSHIP DUES ARE DUE BY FEBRUARY 28.

But rest assured, it was a spontaneous impulse on the part of this treasurer to allow him to systematically evaluate a part of the financial contribution that we will be able to contribute this year to the international fund for the dissemination of the teachings of The Urantia Book. Remember that the AUQ works jointly with the Urantia Association International for these needs, as well as with the Urantia Foundation for the continuity of the translation and publication in several languages of this revelation that has certainly been able to provoke a spark in you and me. Good planning always rests on its foundations.

But apart from the costs inherent in publishing this newsletter and the periodical Journal AUI which occasionally brings us a balm, it is rare that our association can effectively contribute to this noble cause of dissemination without the contribution of our members. Thus, your contribution as a member becomes, even without your knowledge, part of the lever which allows us to support the actualization of our ideal of a better world.

Your membership contribution is not tax deductible, it is proudly recorded as a voluntary participation of an active member. As such, your opinion regarding the direction of our association is worthy of a voice. And since actions speak louder than words, we invite you to remain active in your own way. The main thing is that each of us can come to help at least one other person recognize the reality of the Father in us.

So for my repentance, I will make it my duty to issue a tax receipt for any amount exceeding your membership contribution (humor obliges), and to congratulate you on your continuity. You can contribute at any time of the year.

Brotherly affection,
Alain Cyr, Treasurer

## 10^th^ VERSE OF THE TAO

(LIVING IN UNITY)

Being the bearer of a soul and a body and embracing unity, can you avoid separation?

Can you love your people and rule your kingdom without being complacent?

Can you let your body become as flexible as a newborn baby's? As the gates of heaven open and close, can you play the feminine part in you?

To give birth and to nourish; to have without possessing; to work without taking credit; to lead without mastering or dominating.

He who heeds this power brings the Tao to this Earth.

This is the first virtue.
