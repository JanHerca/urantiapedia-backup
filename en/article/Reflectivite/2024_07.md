Dear readers and esteemed members of the association,

While spring has barely begun, summer already seems to be just around the corner. It is undeniable that time flies by at a dizzying speed. This perception of time varies from one person to another, but it is commonly accepted that the older we get, the more time seems to escape us at a frantic pace. This phenomenon, which I call relative time, could be the subject of a conference in its own right.

Rather than dwelling on the theory of the relativity of time, let's focus on how we can make the most of this time that is slipping away from us. Many people dedicate their retirement to volunteering, finding meaning and a reason for living. As a student of revelation, it would be a shame to let this precious time slip away without giving back what we have so generously received.

_Clermont Beaudry_
Three Rivers

I subscribed last February to the monthly journal Réflectivité, which I now receive on my tablet and which I read attentively while savoring the exceptional quality and wealth of knowledge and experiences on several subjects, which are shared with us so generously by the participating members.

I showed up timidly on Sunday, May 5 in Drummondville to attend in person the conference on spiritual unity given by Gaétan Charland, whom I knew from the articles I had been reading for 2 months now.

Curious to see in person who these people were who published such wonderful articles, each one more brilliant than the last, in order to try to know them better, these completely unique people.

At Ambassador School, **The Ministry of the Master** course strives to enhance and improve spirituality, not to change a person's religion.

If you want to make a difference in someone's life and be a spiritual support, this course will provide you with the answers you need.

## What is The Ministry of the Master

-This is the ministry that Jesus started.
- It is the ministry of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men.

A good friend and French cousin from overseas, Dominique Ronfet, a fervent reader of the _Urantia Book_, recently sent me an email in which he shared with me one of his readings concerning time in the biography of Francis Wolf. Here is an extract from the book in question concerning time, Einstein and his interlocutor:

## Why a study group?

As a student of The Urantia Book and a long-time host and member of study groups, I have always been deeply interested in their value to the mission of The Urantia Book. Over the years, I have organized numerous activities to promote not only the creation of new study groups, but also to explore their role in disseminating the teachings of The Urantia Book. I firmly believe that study groups are ideal venues for training a new generation of spiritual leaders and teachers in harmony with the teachings of Jesus.

In this article, I will list some of the reasons why it is important for every reader to participate in a study group, as well as what I believe to be their mission, philosophy, and purpose. Together, we will explore many of these reasons, as many readers, old and new, often ask the question: WHY PARTICIPATE IN A STUDY GROUP?

## Comparison between Jesus of Nazareth and Donald Trump

It may seem strange to make a comparison between Jesus of Nazareth and Donald Trump, but since Trump's evangelical Christian supporters have already compared him to the crucified Jesus (La Presse+ of Saturday June 15, 2024, under the pen of Yves Boisvert), and since he himself has called himself Mother Teresa, a political prisoner or a crusader for religious freedom, then it would be fun and interesting to do so!

(Conference presented at the 2023 congress in Sydney)

_(Editor's note: in order to open our thoughts to the opinions of our brothers and sisters from other countries, we will offer you, on occasion, texts from conferences previously published in another language, but translated into French. Enjoy reading!)_

Hello everyone,

The theme of our conference this year—“Speaking a Revelation”—is something that every reader of _The Urantia Book_ realizes. While our own ascension should be our primary goal, it is difficult not to want to share with others the higher truths that enrich our lives. We should not be overwhelmed by the importance of this task, but rather be aware of the opportunities that present themselves to us.

## God, Jesus and Love

_Francine Fortin_

What I find sad is that those who believe in Jesus only remember his death on the cross and that the little of his teachings left in the gospels of his apostles is lost because of this tragedy.

Now that I have been studying the life and teachings of Jesus for years, thanks to _The Urantia Book_, I feel an increased responsibility, which I have accepted, not only to continue his ministry of making known the true nature of God, the source of Love, but also to try to educate believers by enhancing the image of Jesus and the message he addresses to us on brotherhood and fatherhood.

Of course, I must be careful not to offend the beliefs of religious fervents, especially by speaking of the Spirit of Truth, a new concept for most of them.

I am therefore inspired by this teaching from our Master:

“He did not wish to destroy, by the establishment of a precise ceremonial, the individual concept of divine communion, nor did he wish to limit the spiritual imagination of believers by paralyzing it in a formal manner.

## Living today with knowledge of the past

We can clearly see that we live in an era of discoveries and scientific research, but also in an era where, thanks to the Internet, general information is accessible to the greatest number of people.

Of course, as an investigator and researcher, you must maintain a critical mind and compare information in order to determine what is true from what is false.

However, we live in an age where everything is gradually being brought to light; and the more people are informed about lies and deceptions, the more a sorting and cleaning is done of all that is erroneous and misleading.

It has already started, but I think that in the future a very large number of philosophical, cosmological and religious approaches (among many other things) will be swept away thanks to this.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
