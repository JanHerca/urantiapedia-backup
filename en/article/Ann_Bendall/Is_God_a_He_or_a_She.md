I had not realized that there was some discussion on God's sex until a few months ago, when I stumbled into a situation which I try very hard to avoid — getting into theological discussions on Our Father. From past experience I have discovered that the majority of folks who want to 'sort me out' on who God is, hold their views both strongly, blindly, irrationally and determinedly, so I switch the subject to a safer topic such as the weather.

I missed my cue, when a rather inebriated man censured me on my concept of God as a person — having explained HE was a force, to which I asked why he had just given a gender identity to a force, a puzzling use of the English language, acceptable in French, but inappropriate in our nominated communication medium when he rejoined, “And what about your sexuality?”

Now I must admit I was temporarily taken aback. I had just been in the throes of interjecting with a request for a weather report in his geographic area, and he had taken the initiative, or so I thought, to switch the subject from religion to sex, a rather surprising change, but a subject which I am partial to discussing. I was not quite sure whether he meant me to recount the last time I went to bed with someone; if I was feeling insecure as a woman; inadequate or whatever, and so answered his question with one of my own for further elaboration, to which he rejoined:

“Well, how do you feel as a woman, with God being represented as a man?”

Now I had really not thought of Our Father as being “Our Father — a woman!” I gave his question a few seconds deliberation and answered that I really felt delightfully comfortable with God being a man, actually I really could not imagine Him being any sex than male, but added: “a very important type of male — an androgynous one”. He did not understand the meaning and so I said: “God is unisex!”

He is, all in perfection. He is, and knows men and women, for did He not create “in His image”?

He laughed, made some comment as to how I never seemed to be stuck for a reply to anything. He did not seem to want to know anything about my opinions on sex, we chatted about mundane things and said goodbye.

But my curiosity had been aroused, and so I decided to find out what was the issue involved which was putting pressure on Our Father to have a sex change, in the minds of Urantians. Now it appears from my brief research — it had to be brief, for I really found in talking to ladies who feel that this sexist nonsense has got to stop and God should be a She instead of a He — I need to switch the subject to the weather faster and faster with each encounter.

It appears that, in a number of institutionalized religions, they are trying to reduce the continual redirection of spiritual requests coming out of Urantia, and are weaning most of their followers off numerous saints, and in particular, the virgin Mary, and get the congregation to direct all prayers to Jesus in the first instance. This does cause a lot of upset with the feminists who tell me that they feel that a man is not understanding enough of their emotions. My eyes widen in amazement. They don't think that Jesus is understanding of their emotional problems! They re-clarify that, no, they are not really saying this, but somehow they feel more of a bond in praying to a woman. You can guess what my next comment is!

One visit I had was with a lady minister and she explained that women do need to feel the closeness with a spiritual mother. I suggested that perhaps they will find, within the three members of the Trinity, a suitable Mother image, and she told me an amusing story which I would like to share with you.

The Trinity concept is a difficult one to grasp, and in theological college they were taught by a number of audio-visual techniques, one of which was a video of the activities in Heaven on a normal working day, centred within God's home. Perhaps to cut down on production costs, the whole video was ‘shot’ in one locale, God's office. To help the budding theological students, God was represented, seated behind a beautiful desk, discussing matters of universal import with God the Son, who was seated on the other side, while the Conjoint Actor was portrayed as Mum, whose tasks included popping in to replenish their coffee cups, change the vase of flowers on the desk, and run the duster quickly over the bookcase! I am sure this lovely lady has told this story numerous times, but still gets enjoyment to the point that we both laughed till tears were rolling down our faces. She advised that they never saw the end of the video, as the class was so much in hysterics, that their lecturer felt that they were just not grasping the subtle concepts of the Trinity.

But why do ladies want God to be a “She”? Surely the complement to ourselves, is our opposite. A little girl's first love is her Dad. The Blue Book tells us that there is no partnership as effective as members of the opposite sex.

> “A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women.” (<a id="a60_141"></a>[UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9))

Why do ladies want Jesus and God to be female? I'm darned if I know.

And yet, as I think on this subject, I pose the question, would perhaps men, in this day and age, be benefited by looking at Jesus and God, not as masculine in the current human sense of the word, but more as androgynous? With the shameful way that little boys are educated to be actionists, to stifle and suppress their emotions, I wonder if therefore a goodly number have difficulty in understanding their Thought Adjuster, and the Spirit of Truth's loving guidance on how to “love as our Father loves”!

Maybe, if men could look at God more as a “She”, by Urantian definitions, they would be so much more spiritually responsive to mercy ministering, and be less factual and judgmental. (I love each and everyone of you, but boy, you can frustrate me at times!) I do not really know, as I am a woman and am really pleased that God and Jesus are male. But of this I am confident; the Eternal Son is described as our Mother; Michael of Nebadon is described as having a tinge more personality of the Eternal Son than of Our Father, and so perhaps they can be regarded as “She”, without too much mental discomfort. The reality, as I see it, is that once a man responds to the guidance of the spiritual influences within him, then as a by-product, any ideational confusion he may have on a material level of mind, due to the gender role requirements currently at play on Urantia, will be replaced by his Thought Adjuster and his personality's mastery of his mind; but, in the interim, it may be of value to dwell more on God's love, and Jesus' love and mercy.
