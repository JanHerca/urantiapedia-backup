_by Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld._

The reason as to why _The URANTIA Book_ was given to us was at first of no concern to me. I was so glad to be living now and a recipient of the beautiful book.

As I mixed with other readers the question was often raised and I wondered if we were so far out of line with normal planetary evolution, that Michael's Spirit of Truth was being rarely requested by individuals. So as an eleventh hour measure, similar to the third epochal revelation, permission was granted for us to have the book.

But this did not seem an acceptable reason to me. Why did Michael waive his authority? Why was the permission given from Uversa? This is Michael's very special planet, he has total power and need not rely on precedent where Urantia is concerned.

And then one day another reason came to me, and my toes tingled in pleasure at the possibility that we may not be as truant as I had thought. That we had actually progressed spiritually and in the social brotherhood of man to the stage that the time was now right for us to have the Blue Book.

I base my belief on the following facts:-

1) A paradise son normally arrives on the planet and the seraphim sing, “Peace on earth and goodwill to all men.” The planet has normally reached a level of social brotherhood when the Paradise Son comes. Not so with Urantia. So Michael was premature in comparison with the norm on other planets.
2) He never succeeded in swaying the populace away from the kingdom idea of their forebears.
3) Michael was given a mandate to leave no writings.

But when he was so “bold” (<a id="a49_27"></a>[UB 141:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p7_8)) that the apostles felt he may be beside himself, he saw the effect of his incarnation on Urantia. The benefit to all of his creation. And perhaps he saw the days of social brotherhood of man on Urantia. The days of _The URANTIA Book_.

Jesus was before his time and so his words, his life, perhaps had to await the time on URANTIA when people had learnt to appreciate that his way was the right way and the only way. I believe that Urantia has reached that stage as a consequence of which we are given Jesus' life on Urantia in all its, beauty, at a time when we can understand its meaning, should we so choose. I believe _The URANTIA Book_ was planned for us during the time of Jesus' life on Urantia, and that Uversa awaited the midwayers petition that the planet was now ready.
