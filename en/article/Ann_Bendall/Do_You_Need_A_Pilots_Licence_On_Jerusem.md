I suspect it will not be necessary if we choose to fly by bird, but the mechanical devices are going to need operational instructions. Actually, as I read _The URANTIA Book_, I get the impression that they are little morontia helicopters, and suspect that there are limited seats on them. Goodness, I hope that they, at least, have room for a navigator, as I get a mental image of me trying to steer the contraption through space with a map upside down on my lap (maybe I will not be left-handed on the mansion worlds) trying to figure out where I am going.

Seeing one can break limbs whilst in morontia form, I can visualize myself and the poor trusting unfortunate who decided to accompany me on my joy flight, bruised and plastered, hobbling out of the Jerusem hospital a few weeks later. Perhaps my apprehensions are unfounded, as I did not note any reference to aircraft disaster statistics in the Blue Book, and we all know that you cannot get killed up there.

Life was definitely less complicated for me before _The URANTIA Book_, when all there was was one place called heaven! We did not do much except play harps; there was eternal indolence! I could cope with having wings, and flitting through heaven, as I imagined that I could never get lost; heaven was like a spiritual Earth, and although it had suburbs and states and countries, if I got lost, some obliging spirit would fly home with me. But this was all so much theorizing, since I really knew I had nothing to worry about, as I would have transcended time and space and could be anywhere my heart desired on forever hereafter, and have found it somewhat disconcerting to be told this is not the case.

I am going to have to learn navigation and languages, and although I am alright when travelling between planets, as then I am enseraphimed, and have the most sublime confidence in the transport Seraphim. They have been travelling the Universe for years, and even if they did get lost, a Solitary Messenger or some such person would locate them, and I would have slept through the whole thing. It is the intra-planetary transport that is worrisome. Maybe they will have the equivalent of Urantia public transport!

Air space does seem to be reasonably well controlled with a designated take off and landing place and times of departure, but I would love to see the radar tracking stations. Must be fascinating to see all the folks to-ing and fro-ing throughout the universe.

I wonder if the morontia machines are like Urantia helicopters. I just love helicopters, and I could fly close to the ground so I did not get too lost, and there are no mountains to crash into if I happen to not be looking ahead of me.

I suppose they provide us with crash helmets, but then I am not quite sure because I do not know whether we wear any clothes up there.

When I go to school up there, I hope that my celestial advisers do not feel that I should undertake a scientific stream of studies, as I really feel my calling is more in the direction of the reversion corps. I suppose I would not mind being a laboratory assistant in the Life Carriers laboratories, as I would be interested in seeing how they decide that a tomato should be red in colour rather than blue. Fine technical details such as that appeal to me, and to think they pack all of this information into protozoa!

Beyond a cursory glance of post-Urantia mansion world living, to date I have not started serious deliberations on Uversa daily lifestyle, but maybe, after being a reader for another ten years or so, I will give up trying to envisage the mansion worlds and see if the worlds beyond are any more clearly described!
