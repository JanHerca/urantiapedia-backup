_by Ann Bendall_

As I view my day in retrospect I suspect being my seraphim must be a real chore. I am somewhat relieved that seraphim always work in pairs. At least they have someone to cheer them up, someone's shoulder to cry on when, exhausted, they heave a sigh of relief that another day is over.

How much laughter do they share with me, as I with Shakespearian stance dramatically view the minor obstacles of daily living? How many songs of joy do I compose so they can hum along? Do I, the fool, rush in whilst seraphim sit on the side-line shaking their heads, rolling up their celestial sleeves to pick up the pieces at the end of my risk taking?

No doubt the guardians have to square their shoulders, and with prayers for strength, resist hitting me over the head, have to run along behind screaming into my ears — “When will you start taking a modicum of responsibility? Why is it always up to us?”

Even more disturbing to my growing awareness, is that if I somehow appear up on the mansion worlds before my desired time, my poor seraphim are going to have to give a “please explain!”

Spare a little time for your seraphim. Give them a bit of fun today! Don't take unnecessary risks. My seraphim are very skilled at driving, but, boy do they get tired of having to do most of the steering and braking while I am creatively solving all of the problems of the world, overtaxing every other driver on the road.

I want my seraphim to laugh with good humour at my jokes, with me, the initiator of light-hearted humour. I want my seraphim to visit new places every day and not steel themselves for another trip into hell, as a result of my refusal to learn. I want my seraphim to be rewarded on the scene of their creation. I want to synchronise with their celestial plans. Not arriving too late. Too early. Or not at all. And removing the rose-coloured glasses. My seraphim deserve a little consideration and love. Maybe tomorrow!
