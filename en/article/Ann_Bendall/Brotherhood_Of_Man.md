We are advised in _The URANTIA Book_ that there are sources of energy still undiscovered by us and one of these, I believe, is the energy force of love. The power of potent prayer, generated in true altruistic desire for the progress of our planet toward “light and Life” has the capacity to generate a power field far beyond our material mind-thought influential sphere.

Love is the force to which the universe responds. Science is starting to recognise the potency of the “collective consciousness” and the Brotherhood of Man will come into being based on the same principles.

_The URANTIA Book_ says: “You cannot truly love your fellows be a mere act of the will. Love is only born of thoroughgoing understanding of your neighbour's motives and sentiments. It is not so important to love all men today as it is that each day you learn to love one more human being. If each day or each week you achieve an understanding of one more of your fellows, and if this is the limit of your ability, then you are certainly socializing and truly spiritualizing your personality. Love is infectious, and when human devotion is intelligent and wise, love is more catching than hate. But only genuine and unselfish love is truly contagious. If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity to such an extent that all civilization would be encompassed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man.” (<a id="a40_935"></a>[UB 100:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_6))

Wow! Not the beginning of the brotherhood, but the actual realization!

There are lots of people on this planet who can “play dumb”. We readers are denied this role. There are lots of Christians who can sit down and pour over their Bible, clasp hands together and kneel in prayerful stance, seeking guidance from our Father as to what to do, how to “be perfect as our heavenly Father is”. We URANTIA Book readers have had all the guesswork removed, we are the spoilt children, it has been placed into our laps what we have got to do, with no opportunity to plead ignorance.

The Brotherhood of Man is a possibility now, in our lifetime, if we can devote all our efforts into loving with intelligence and wisdom. We must take our thoughts and emotions to task, and ensure that they become such as would please our Father. Look at our thoughts — they are so petty, so judgmental. Instead of thinking what our loved ones should do, learn to love then as they really are. Their life path is different, the hurdles, the mountains, to you may be mole hills, but they are not yours.

Every person walking this planet is our brother and sister, The fact that they may not recognize this may have the effect of making interaction inadvisable, or impossible, but what about a great big prayer that our Paradise Father's will waxes daily in their lives, as you go whistling off, smelling the roses.

So many people we meet have great difficulty communicating their innermost feelings, as a consequence of which we cannot really understand them. The emotional pool within them lags very much behind their intellect, and inside is a frightened child, very confused about life, love, and you. Pray that someone will come along more suitable to guide them, should they reject you.

By learning to understand yourself — the stupid petty fears, the restrictions you place on your own growth, the false attitudes towards others, expectations of then which naturally lead to disappointment; this self-understanding will give you invaluable insight into your close-minded brother's state of being.

I verily believe the emotion love has an aura around it which registers on the senses of all whom you contact either by thought or physical meeting. The mind of the person may put up a barrier against contact, but deep within a little seed of love is sown within that person.

Back to the excerpt quoted — “the sentimental emotion stream of humanity.” Is this what scientists are calling the “collective consciousness” — which, they are starting to discover, is choked up with guilt and fear born of erroneous beliefs accumulated over centuries? Beliefs which help the growth of society but at the expense of the individual to the stage that, in the twentieth century, we feel guilt-ridden because, try as we might, to be and think and feel like other people, or as they want us to, our Thought Adjuster won't let us because it is not reality.

There is a sentimental emotion-stream of humanity — the power of love — that's far greater than any other emotion. Let's start generating our own little love dynamo with our Father's blessing, that all our brothers and sisters will open their minds to ever growing truth, beauty and goodness.

Man's mind has made a mess of this planet — that same mind can rectify the mistakes made. We are caretakers of Michael's planet and in the twentieth century we have converted it to a rubbish tip. We have denuded and polluted oceans and forests, etc. etc.

As URANTIA Book readers we must not decry the current mess but look at tomorrow, the results of our prayers of faith love and belief in the efficacy of same — governments will change, scientists will make discoveries.

We live in very exciting times!

> “Now is the time for you to make the effort to know God... Feel the love of God; then in every person you will see the face of the Father, the light of Love which is in all. You will find a magic, living relationship uniting the trees, the sky, the stars, all people, and all living things; and you will feel a oneness with them. This is the code of divine love.”
