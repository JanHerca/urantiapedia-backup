Loving Father, Michael, and Mother, 
Thank you for this worship inspiration
The story of Jesus washing the apostles' feet, 
The Master serving in the most menial way
With dignity and graciousness.
May we too learn this lesson
And be inspired here and now
To serve others as you serve us.
We are all subjected to the dust of evil
And the dirt of the sin in this world
That we need cleaned from our minds.
You continually work here within us
To bring us spiritual enlightenment,
Working ceaselessly in the soil
Supporting the roots of our progressing soul.
We will grow and rise in your light,
Blossom in this season and
Bear the fruits of loving service
For our brothers and sisters
In your family,
