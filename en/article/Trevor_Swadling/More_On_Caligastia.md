_Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

I would like to make a few observations concerning the current tendency for some readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to accuse or imply that some people are being influenced by Caligastia. Perhaps we may find some clues from _The URANTIA Book_ itself. A couple of characters who come to mind from _The URANTIA Book_ who one would expect to be candidates for being influenced by Caligastia, are Judas and some of the members of the Sanhedrin. What does the book say about them in relation to this? On UB 179:2.3 We read:

> “_He [Jesus] fully realised that this traitorous betrayal was the work of Judas, but it also pleased Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia._” <a id="a40_137"></a>[UB 179:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_3)

Then on UB 183:0.4:

> “_Though Jesus knew that the plan for his death had its origin in the councils of the rulers of the Jews, he was also aware that all such nefarious schemes had the full approval of Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia._” <a id="a44_217"></a>[UB 183:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_4)

Then on UB 66:8.6:

> “_...neither Caligastia nor Daligastia was ever able to oppress mortals or coerce any normal individual into doing anything against the human will._” <a id="a48_152"></a>[UB 66:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_6)

From these and other statements throughout the book we could assume that even well-intentioned but misguided thoughts, evil thoughts or even sinful thoughts at first originate in people's own human minds. It is the implementation of these thoughts into action that cause the problems. Once these kind of thoughts are put into train, Caligastia might use situations to his own ends, but we are not in a position to be absolutely sure, we just don't know. In so doing we may be giving Caligastia credit where credit is not due. Therefore under these circumstances I think it is wise to err on the side of caution rather than to suggest or accuse people of being under the direct influences of Caligastia. On UB 110:5.5, _The URANTIA Book_ warns us about adjuster guidance:

> “_But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity._” <a id="a52_231"></a>[UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)

I think we should have the same attitude towards supposed influence by Caligastia on people. It would be safer in my view to look at it as people being led away by their own delusions, philosophic confusion or evil human propensities rather than suggesting they were under his direct evil influence. I am concerned at this tendency to suggest that others are being directly influenced by Caligastia. The main problem I have with this is that people may tend to use these arguments to point the finger at individuals whom they may not agree with or like, and use it against those who do not even think exactly the same as them. An attitude of blaming the devil is like harking back to the dark ages, not what did it but who did it. We may speculate on these things, but to come out and suggest or accuse people when we are not in a position to know beyond a doubt that they are directly under his influence would be totally un-Jesus-like and totally unproductive, and in many cases may be absolutely unjustified and hurtful to those to whom it may be implied.

The important and relevant thing for us to focus on in the case of Caligastia is to understand the causes, the repercussions, and the philosophy behind these so called liberated and false teachings — ‘The Doctrines of Lucifer’. In understanding the causes and effects of these teachings and seeing the confusion and disaster that resulted from them surely would put us in a better position now not to be attracted and deceived by them. Therefore an understanding, in hindsight, of Lucifer's downfall, and also a study of the downside and propensities of human nature would be helpful in combating these human tendencies that may lead us astray.

In looking at ‘The Doctrines of Lucifer’ one of the detestable things we come to notice in Lucifer's manifesto is that it seems to be akin and linked, quite deliberately packaged, to appeal to the natural and vulnerable tendencies of mankind such as: the easy way to do things, immediate results, the mixing of good and evil to reach a desired end more quickly, impatience, selfishness, self-assertion, pride, self-motivated liberty and denial of the laws of God and of God himself etc. No wonder it was so devastating on our young evolving planet and took hold so readily. To quote a small part of the second head of the manifesto, “_...if men and angels only had the courage to assert themselves and boldly claim their rights_”

We of today now stand amidst the shreds and lingering embers of Lucifer's dying document of “the sophistry of spurious personal liberty-rejection of universe allegiance and disregard of fraternal obligations, blindness to cosmic relationships”. The surest safeguard against Caligastia's Godless and ‘self philosophy’ and it's repercussions for us is presented on UB 34:7.6:

> “_Jesus showed mankind the new way of moral living whereby human beings may very largely escape the dire consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and most effectively compensate for the deprivations resulting from the Adamic default. ‘The spirit of the life of Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of animal living and the temptations of evil and sin._’” <a id="a62_363"></a>[UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6)

It is this we need to thirst for and build on, and in the process _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that one of the most important things we need to learn as humans is teamwork.

In conclusion, let's look at three cases in _The URANTIA Book_ that have a familiar thread. The first is Serapatatia and Eve; if only they had shared their thoughts and plans with others such as Adam they may have realised the consequences of their well-meant but wrong actions, and after discussing their ideas with others may have decided against it. When the authors look at the reasons for Judas' downfall, it was his unwillingness to confide in those closest to him, his harbouring of resentments which caused him not to share his life with those who really loved him, failing to share his feelings with those to whom he belonged. Even the Sanhedrin, if it was not for their puffed-up pride and feelings of importance, had they listened to Jesus and went out amongst the people with an attitude of trying to understand the truths he was proclaiming, they may have avoided the proud and wicked position they had decided upon. So let us pause for a moment — in remembrance of old John Zebedee as they carried him to church in a chair — he had his problems, and from time to time no doubt would have had a few clashes with his co-workers for the kingdom by God he would have seen a bit in his life — and what were the only words he spoke — “my little children, love one another!”

In my opinion our attitude towards Caligastia as a person should be one of non recognition, as the book implies — he's as good as finished and I believe it's just a matter of time.
