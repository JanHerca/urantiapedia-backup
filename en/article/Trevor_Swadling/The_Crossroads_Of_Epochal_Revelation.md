_by Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

After Jesus physically left this planet he left in trust to his ambassadors the continuing work he had trained them for. From our reading we come to love and understand these ambassadors. We also realise their differences and the well-intentioned but sometimes undesirable outcomes that their opinions had on the outworking of the gospel. But these noble men did act. The rest is history. The fourth epochal revelation was partially successful but could have been more so had greater wisdom been exercised. However, one of the world's mightiest religions evolved from these humble beginnings. We look back, shake our heads and think the apostles acted foolishly and think that we have been taught lessons so that when our turn comes we won't make those same mistakes.

We of today have been blessed, through _The URANTIA Book_, with a wealth of information as to why events unfold as they do. As we look into the future from now to the unfolding of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, we should gather and draw wisely on its contents. We have been blessed with a larger revelation and therefore, no doubt, we may be more accountable.

In this task of helping to disseminate the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ in a lasting manner, we all have a part to play. In many ways this may be done, such as: by passing on our values to our children; the daily contact we have with our fellows; the influence through our vocation; placing books in libraries; buying a copy for a friend; pooling our resources and acting as a team; organising ourselves and benefiting from working together; creating a network of readers so new readers can be put in touch with others; fostering study groups; supporting and helping the aims and objectives of URANTIA Foundation, etc. All the above and more are essential to the unfolding of this revelation. “_The act is ours; the consequences God's._” (<a id="a42_742"></a>[UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13))

Through ours lives and efforts, in time, many will come across _The URANTIA Book_ or be familiar with its existence. Eventually society will become aware of the social organization of students who represent it. It would be wise and helpful if at this stage the book was established within the book trade in the normal manner, and that people of different cultures and religious backgrounds were readers. The degree of attraction and acceptance to the teachings of the book may be determined by the social fragrance of this organization and by the calibre of the individuals who represent it. It is sensible to have one united social and fraternal organization of students of _The URANTIA Book_.

With this in mind, let's have a look at what could go wrong; how could the revelation be lastingly discredited or watered down? What mistaken actions would make it similar to the partial successes of the first, second, third, or fourth epochal revelations? The outcome will be up to each and every student of _The URANTIA Book_. The possibilities of misinterpretation, bigotry, unfortunate organizational wrangling of themselves will not necessarily deflate or wreck the revelation itself if there is a strong core of committed readers who are sincerely committed to working to support and foster it.

However one danger to the success of this revelation would be a loss of the identity of the original text after copyright runs out. What will operate to display the original text from other possible adulterated copies? Imagine in a few generations if in front of you are ten URANTIA Books all looking the same, but on closer observation you find meanings have been changed while in others more radical changes have occurred. Some may have been deliberately packaged; changed so that they be better sellers. Different organizations may grow around the different books and more than one may claim to read the authentic text resulting in theological and dogmatic competition amongst believers.

There is an epochal revelation at stake that has been intrusted to be protected and shared with all mankind now and for future generations. As we respect the teachings of the book we should also understand the significance and purpose of the seal that identifies and protects it.

The only thing I can see to avoid this scenario and to protect the original text for all generations to come is that there be only one that has the three azure blue circles placed upon it to distinguish it from the rest. It is worthy to have Michael's emblem upon it. Within its pages is the portrayal of the nature and character of his, and our, heavenly father; an account of the very life and teachings of our Master himself. The way this is achieved in our modern-day world is for the existing trademarks to be maintained. What a sad day it would be if the identity of the original version could not be protected for all time. There is an epochal revelation at stake that has been intrusted to be protected and shared with all mankind now and for future generations. As we respect the teachings of the book we should also understand the significance and purpose of the seal that identifies and protects it. Let us not cheapen this symbol; let us keep it where it belongs. Let us move faithfully and wisely forward in disseminating the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ to the world.
