Sally has volunteered in many ways for the Fellowship, active in the music program at international conferences, and currently helping with our graduation memorial web page. She is interested in the Family Life committee, Interfaith Committee, and International Committee.

**What are your hopes and ideas for _The Urantia Book_?**

My hope is that it becomes well known as a source of inspiration and accepted as truth worldwide. I have ideas for secondary works.

**What are your hopes and ideas for The Fellowship?**

I want to know the Fellowship on a deeper level, and help to disseminate the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ by working with likeminded souls. Actually, working with non-likeminded souls is good too, good for growing. Two or more minds are always better than one! I don't have any ideas for the Fellowship at the moment, but I'm sure I will if/when I am more involved and put my mind to it.

> Working with non-like-minded souls is good too, good for growing.

**Why are you seeking service in the Fellowship?**

I appreciate and respect the work the Fellowship does, and I long to be more useful. I want to get to know my fellow brothers and sisters more intimately, and I would like to work toward a leadership position.

**How do you feel your skill set and/or experience qualifies you to serve?**

I have performed the role of Treasurer for the Pilot Light Society of Seattle, and the role of Secretary for other organizations. I was on the Musician's Committee to help organize for IC17 in Denver and also led an art workshop there.

## Oluwatooni 0 yeyemi (Toni) from Basel, Switzerland

Toni is a truly dedicated man with a deep joy who wants to help create a curriculum to be easily understood by children. Toni made it clear that he really wants to serve.

**What are your hopes and ideas for _The Urantia Book_?**

To be able to present it in a way that children can effectively receive the message.

**What are your hopes and ideas for The Fellowship?**

Aborderless community reaching every religion, race and language. 

**Why are you seeking service in the Fellowship?**

I really want to serve. I have benefited greatly from the Fellowship and the book. I believe I have some knowledge and experience to share and contribute. I consider service the next step in my journey.

**How do you feel your skill set and/or experience qualifies you to serve?**

I am a pastor and have served in ministerial positions for over 15 years. I am very committed to the study of _The Urantia Book_, personal devotion and personal growth. I have excellent teaching and administrational skills, and am also comfortable with financial statements. I have a good exposure and understanding of other religions as well.

## Al Lockett from Gastonia, North Carolina

Al was previously on the General Council. He works as a tutor for children in 3-6th grade, has experience with a 501C 3 and a good awareness of Robert's Rules of Order. Al helped start (or did start) a project which feeds 1,400 children a day in southern Arkansas. He has been reading for 49 years and after tending to many projects now wishes to return to the Fellowship as a General Counselor again with renew ed purpose and drive.

**What are your hopes and ideas for The Urantia Book?**

That it continues its important role as the 5th Epochal Revelation in the spiritual uplift of the planet and provides spiritual satisfaction and refuge for truth searchers worldwide.

**What are your hopes and ideas for The Fellowship?**

That its presence, and influence continues to grow physically in numbers, intellectually in wisdom, and spiritually in the collective unity of faith.

**Why are you seeking service in the Fellowship?**

Because I have the time, experience and desire to serve and take on a larger role in the Fellowship.

**How do you feel your skill set and/or experience qualifies you to serve?**

I have been a student of the book since 1972. I was an early instructor in what was then the inauguration of the Urantia Book Internet School. I have given numerous workshops, presented topical addresses at conferences, served as a minister and teacher for Sunday services, done radio and television interviews on behalf of the Fellowship, worked book fairs, participated in over five study groups, shared and discussed _The Urantia Book_ with hundreds of readers and searchers of truth, published several articles, and served once before on the Fellowship's General Council.
