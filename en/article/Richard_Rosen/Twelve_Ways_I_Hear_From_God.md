Hearing from the Divine may seem mysterious, abstract of something that just happens to you, but we have control. There are principles by which we hear from God. These are the ones that wok for me. Each of us, because we have a unique relationship with God, will differ in how he hears the divine voice. These are here to stimulate your thinking. 

## Talk Over Decisions 

I talk over decisions and problems I’m facing. I ask for wisdom in making decisions. I quiet my mind and emotions so I’m better able to hear my Father’s voice. I listen for his thoughts. 

During my real estate career I sent out a series of mailings to people whose properties had failed to sell. I began with some lightly edited examples that others had used, but in time a couple of them no longer felt right. But I was unable to see the changes I should make (which is unusual for me). I asked God for insight. It didn’t come right away; it took several weeks. That’s how it is at times; answers need time to coalesce and become conscious thoughts. Answers are also conditioned by your capacity to receive them, and in accordance with the scope and nature of the request. 

By the way, this is an example that nothing is too small to ask of God. It helps to form the habit of God- mindedness. 

## Upstep My Thoughts 

God always attempts to upstep my thoughts into better ones. I know they are his when they have the symmetry of beauty, the ring of truth, and an aura of goodness. 

## Remove Emotional Poisons 

Removing emotional poisons, like anger, envy, self-pity, and so on, clears my thinking. Doing this over a long time makes it a habit. It then becomes fairly easy to recognize hurtful feelings and unfruitful thoughts. I refuse to indulge them.   

## Follow Guidance 

By faith, I follow God’s guidance and inspiration. He sees to it that all will turn out right because I do my best to do what he wants—even if I make a mistake. 

Steve was offered a job by a friend, which he accepted. However, his current employer offered an increase in position and salary to stay, which he did. His friend felt badly that he reneged on his commitment, especially after going to bat for him. 

His current employer ran the company in a heavy- handed, you could even say, toxic manner. It wasn’t long before Steve realized how great a mistake he made. What Steve hadn’t learned about life yet is that relationships govern all things—that having a company owner and management that treat their employees caringly is more important than position and money. He needed this experience to learn this lesson. So while the decision was a “mistake”, to spiritually “see” it was necessary. It’s “learning the hard way” as my mother used to say. But some things are like that; you need a life lesson to make a particular truth your own. Steve hopefully will not repeat this mistake (error in judgment).   

## Correspondences 

The natural world, a material shadow of reality, can be considered somewhat representational of the spiritual world. Thus, my mind, guided by my indwelling Spirit, interprets natural events spiritually. 

I had a map of the world on my wall that I used for business. Realizing I no longer referred to it, I decided to put up posters of the universes that reflect the paradise journey we will make. It was then the thought came to me that God is expanding my frame of reference from this world to that of the cosmos. Most encouraging. Thank you Father. 

## Patterns of Coincidence 

Patterns of coincidence are sometimes God’s way of directing me. He uses repetition to confirm his direction. It is particularly important for decisions of import such as marrying or taking a job. This scripture says it well. “At the mouth two..or..three witnesses, shall the matter be established” ([Deut. 17:6](/en/Bible/Deuteronomy/17#v6)) The account, earlier in the book, of God leading me to find him illustrates this point. Here’s an example: 

We almost didn’t purchase our present home. The house is adjacent to a couple who worked in the same real estate office as we did. They told us about it, and we went to see it; although we liked it we were not ready to make a decision. Well, a month later they told us that someone had seen it and was interested, and urged us to reconsider. We saw it again and realized that this was indeed the home for us. We bought it, recognizing it is where God wanted us to live. 

God is not unmindful of our temporal welfare, in this case having a proper place to live. Also, spiritual welfare is enhanced by living where God intends. In fact, few decisions are purely material without a spiritual overtone. 

It may take time to receive new thoughts and act on them. God knows this and establishes his direction through a pattern of confirmation. 

Here’s another example of circumstances that are more than mere chance. 

I studied in Strasbourg, France for a year during college. I decided to hitchhike to Munich in Germany and buy a used Volkswagen. On the way, a local police officer stopped and offered a ride to the next town. I told him the purpose of my trip to Munich. He said he knew someone in town selling a Volkswagen and off we went to see it. But I declined, being set on my plan and inflexible to a change of direction. It took me some time to become flexible in my thinking as opportunity presented itself. 

Looking back, I recognize what may well have been a celestial arrangement of circumstances. If I had purchased the car locally, who knew what people I may have met and what may have ensued. 

By the way, two months later the engine died. It did make me think I had missed the boat on that first opportunity I was given. (Fortunately, in those days it was simple for a mechanic to swap out a Volkswagen engine for a rebuilt one, so it wasn’t nearly as costly as replacing a modern engine.) 

Not withstanding those occasions when repetition establishes a direction or action, first thoughts or opportunities are at times the correct ones. (As you can see, there is no scientific formula to discerning God’s will; we each develop discernment unique to our experience of walking with God.) 

## Seek Counsel From Spiritually Minded People 

My wife and I employed a secretary in our property management and real estate business in Connecticut. We were having problems with her, and we didn’t know how to deal with them. So we asked a spiritually minded man we greatly respected because we wanted more than just a natural answer; we sought a spiritual perspective. 

He immediately put his finger on the problem, the core of the issue. She is usurping authority. She’s not the owner and she’s making decisions, acting as if she were. She thinks more of herself than she ought to. You must clearly tell her the limits of her position, put her in her place as it were. 

This we did. Hmm, was she displeased! Nonetheless, she withdrew from overflowing the banks of authority and worked within the channel we defined. Hopefully, she dealt with the inflated opinion of herself. We couldn’t tell. But that’s between her and God. Her indwelling Spirit is well able to take this situation and use it to her advantage—if she is willing.   

## Patience 

I am patient when making important decisions. I wait upon God. Revelation of God’s will is progressive—step by step. 

After my work in the software industry had ended I sought work in our local job market, mostly retirees and quite limited in the availability of the work I sought. Eve suggested I return to real estate with her, but I was quite hesitant. So I told Eve, “Let’s see first what doors God opens before making that decision.” We gave ourselves two months to see what might happen. 

I knocked on plenty of doors, but none opened. So I re- entered real estate sales and it’s turned out to be the right decision. It’s often only after you’ve made a choice and time has passed that you can recognize the value of a decision. 

Even with small decisions, such as comprehending a concept sufficiently for this book, it may not come right away. It requires time for thinking to evolve and thoughts to coalesce, then suddenly understanding appears. At times it requires greater capacity—intellectual, spiritual, or both—which comes only by life experience, in which case it may be months of even years, or perchance the next life, before you can with authority deal with a matter.   

## Dreams and Visions 

My divine Monitor attempts to register spiritual concepts, but I’m on guard because my subconscious thoughts and emotions can distort them. The Spirit of Truth validates their content. Do they contain truth, beauty, and goodness? 

While living in the backwoods of Maine, I had this experience in the night seasons, more than a dream—let’s call it a vision; I’ve not had one since. At this time of my life, I was intensely seeking an answer to what lies beyond this natural world. The vision was an answer to my soul quest. 

The scene opened in Israel with myself seated upon a horse on the top of a hill, with my hands tied behind me, a noose around my neck. There I was, calmly saying to those about to slay me, “Don’t do this, not for my sake, but yours.” Alas, they heeded not my plea, and the horse went from beneath me. The next moment I was flying over vividly beautiful valleys, like superman. And I clearly thought, “So this is what it’s like when you die.” I awoke with the loveliest sense of serenity and assurance. I knew there was indeed life beyond death. 

## Common Sense 

Human wisdom or common sense is a great aid. I put aside theory and profound thinking and say to myself, “What makes sense?” It has become a mainstay in my spiritual decision making. It anchors the spiritual and mindal to the material plane. These must all be in balance. 

I recall times profoundly thinking through a problem, so much so that I’d end bewildered with the many thoughts swirling in confusion. Definitely no connection to the divine here. I’d finally recall my common sense rule and say to myself, “This is crazy.” If a sensible answer didn’t come to mind, then I’d put it all aside and come back to it later when I’d usually see it simply and clearly. And if not, then it wasn’t time for a decision. “In your patience possess your souls.” 

## Perception 

Perception is like hearing God’s voice clearly—not that I actually hear a voice. It’s more like clearly receiving a thought that makes my soul come alive. It is a connecting with the cosmic mind. You know it when your thinking is sharp, clear, and quick. You foresee events, meaning what will result from decisions and solutions to everyday problems. 

John approached me, having _heard_ me drop a handful of purpose, saying that I am a student of life after death and know well what happens. He asked if I would tell him more, but it not being convenient then I suggested we meet and discuss it over breakfast, to which he assented and asked if he could bring Sam, whom I also knew. It was our second get-together that it became clear to me that Sam, while enjoying the conversation and our camaraderie, lacked the interest of John. He was content; he lacked the drive to delve more deeply. In this case, I discerned, meaning it wasn’t clarion clear, but nonetheless held the conviction of certainty. 

Where does this enlightenment and confirmation of truth come from? The Spirit of Truth saying Amen! I think of it as a truth Geiger counter. It may also emanate from the soul in contrast to the human mind; the growing soul develops spirit mindedness, akin to the expression, “Think from the heart.” As the soul matures it comes to dominate the human mind, which in turn dominates the material environment. 

There are gradations of “knowint” or truth sensitivity:  
- understanding (comprehension of fact) 
- discernment (human consciousness, its component parts unified) 
- perception (super consciousness, the reservoir of the higher mind counter-parting acquired cosmic meanings and spiritual values into the fabric of the soul) 
- auto-revelation (the work of the indwelling Spirit) 

These conditions reflect the growth of spiritual consciousness. Of these, revelation is most direct and potent.   

## Spiritual Illumination 

Auto- or personal revelation (spiritual illumination) delights your soul. It is personal, just between God and me. Although direct communication with our Thought Adjuster rare, it doesn’t mean that we cannot augment the conditions that are favorable to his illuminating our minds. Such illumination is perceptible, deliciously real. And some highflying souls attain to readily receiving Adjuster illumination. 

This example took place when Jesus with his father Joseph went up to Jerusalem at around age 13. 

> On the day before the Passover Sabbath, flood tides of spiritual illumination swept through the mortal mind of Jesus and filled his human heart to overflowing with affectionate pity for the spiritually blind and morally ignorant multitudes assembled for the celebration of the ancient Passover commemoration. <a id="a143_311"></a>[[UB 124:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_15)]

> Another example: Jesus asked his apostles “But who say you that I am?”...Simon Peter, springing to his feet, exclaimed: “You are the Deliverer, the Son of the living God.”...(Jesus) said: “This has been revealed to you by my Father.” <a id="a145_236"></a>[[UB 157:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_5)]

And a personal experience: Having scant remembrance of my human father after he died when I was seven, I keenly felt the lack of a father’s watch care. What longing I had for a loving father’s guidance. With this background I recount a pivotal morning years ago. 

I was deeply reflecting in my study loft, my haven, on who the Father is and his nature. It was then that I received the _revelation_ of my spiritual Father, how real he is, how concerned he is with my welfare, how assured I can be in his loving, wise, and all-knowing guidance. It was powerful and sure knowing. 

Oh, how I talked with him, pouring out my heart and thanking him for being my own—my very own—Father. And from that time forth began a deepened relationship: two walking together through life, the divine and the human uniting more and more until that perfect day. It brings a Mona Lisa smile as a write this. 

**And yet there is another way.** As you become aware of the spiritual nature that lives within you, take time to enter into the conscious practice of sharing your inner life. Practice stillness to quiet the incessant thoughts of your mind—and listen. As you align more and more with our spiritual nature, Spirit will speak, and you will hear. Expect to receive the goodness of the universe. While he will not make decisions for you, he will offer options, anticipated results of each course, its ramifications, and it effect on others. And when making important decisions, withdraw from the busyness around you to commune with your spirit. 

**In summary**, these are ways in which I hear and am led. There are yet to be revealed others. Communication with the Divine evolves. This quote from _The Urantia Book_ illustrates this:

> From such vantage points of high living, man is able to transcend the material irritations of the lower levels of thinking — worry, jealousy, envy, revenge, and the pride of immature personality. These high-climbing souls deliver themselves from a multitude of the crosscurrent conflicts of the trifles of living, thus becoming free to attain consciousness of the higher currents of spirit, of spirit concept and celestial communication. <a id="a157_440"></a>[[UB 160:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_5)]

Harry McMullen, at a _Urantia Book_ conference, presented his view of discerning God’s will. Here’s one paragraph to give you a taste (see footnote for the reference to his talk; it’s worth reading.) 

> “Occasionally, we become faced with big decisions: to move to another town, to change our employment, to go into a new business, to marry, and so forth. In such cases, we don’t want any possibility of error; we want to be certain that we have a correct reading of the Father’s will. In such situations we can expect God to confirm his guidance to us by repetition. Different episodes of his guidance will complement and intersect with each other. We get an inner feeling on the matter, then we ask the counsel of spiritually minded friends. From the human perspective, we see that the decision makes good common sense. We feel at peace with God about it. Finally, circumstances may open up in such a way as to facilitate the endeavor. We are not out of line to ask God for his clear, unmistakable guidance before we make a radical change in our lifestyle, and we should not be in a hurry about it. He will use different witnesses to confirm his will to us.”

> Richard Rosen has been a seeker of truth since his teens when he did not know if God existed, but knew there had to be more to this life. During his 25 years of intense involvement in fundamentalist Christianity, he came across _The _Urantia Book in 1985 (by virtue of Bill Rocap), and his relationship with God has since reached a place he did not think possible. He has authored several books designed to make the truths of the revelation more practical and personally applicable in everyday living. (http://bit.ly/AuthorCentral-Rosen). Richard lives in Sebastian, Florida, with his wife of 44 years, Eve, an avid lover of God.
