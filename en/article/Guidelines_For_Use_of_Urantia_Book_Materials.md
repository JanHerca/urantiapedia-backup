RE: Use of Urantia Book Material, etc.

The Declaration of Trust creating Urantia Foundation states: “It shall be the primary duty of the Trustees to perpetually preserve inviolate the text of the Urantia Book.” The Trustees must also protect the name Urantia and the symbol from unauthorized use.

The Trustees of Urantia Foundation have taken the proper steps to afford protection for these three essential aspects of the revelation under the laws pertaining to copyright, symbol registration, trademark, etc., with all rights reserved, including translation in the United States of America, as well as in Canada and other countries of the International Copyright Union, and all rights reserved under Pan-American Copyright Conventions and under the Universal Copyright Convention.

In accordance with these copyrights, the Urantia Foundation has established the following policy regarding permission to quote passages from the Urantia Book, or to produce any portion thereof in any form whatsoever, or to use the name Urantia, or the symbol consisting of three concentric circles:

“No part of this book may be reproduced, translated, or appropriated, in any form or by any means (including electronic, mechanical, or other-- such as photocopying, recording, or any information storage and retrieval system) without permission in writing from the Publisher.”

Of course, the Foundation is always interested in inquiries from sincere individuals who desire to assist in the dissemination of the book, but it must be sure that the purity of the text is maintained. Therefore, each request must be scrutinized carefully, and permission could not at any time be extended without adequate safeguards.

Our legal counsel advises that in order to maintain this protection, the Trustees must carefully review each request to quote material from the Urantia Book, or to use the name Urantia or the symbol, whether such request is from members of Urantia Brotherhood and Urantia Societies, or from non-members.

Each request must be submitted to Urantia Foundation, 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, Illinois 60614, in writing, giving details as to the underlying purpose of the request and the exact use to be made of the material, complete list of passages to be quoted, number of copies to be made, and extent of distribution.

The Trustees are sure that all Urantians realize the importance of Urantia Foundation's maintaining the purity of the Urantia teachings. This can be accomplished only with the full co-operation of all.
