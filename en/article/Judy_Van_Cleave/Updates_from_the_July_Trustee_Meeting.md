1. The Indonesian translation was published at [urantia.org/id/bukuurantia/bagian-depan](https://www.urantia.org/id/buku-urantia/bagian-depan).
2. The 2019 Annual Report was published and distributed in four languages. If you haven't read it, you can see it here: [urantia.org/sites/default/files/ docs/annual-report-2019.pdf](https://www.urantia.org/sites/default/files/docs/annual-report-2019.pdf).
3. Nine more translations were added to the Multi-Language Book at urantia.org. In total, there are now 17 languages. This book allows a user to select an available translation and compare it side by side with any other translation in the book. Click here to see the book: [urantia.org/MultiLanguageBook](https://www.urantia.org/MultiLanguageBook).
4. The Foundation received a sizable estate gift that will be placed into the Revelation Bridge Fund designated for future generations. If you are interested in planned giving that supports the long-term viability and work of Urantia Foundation, please visit [urantia.plannedgiving.org](https://urantia.plannedgiving.org/), or call Tamara Strumfeld at 773-525-3319 ext. 217.
5. With the final development stage of the Spanish revision completed, it now enters the quality assurance phase. We expect the completed book in April 2021. A warm-hearted thanks to the team for their decade-long labor of love. Víctor García-Bory and Gaétan Charland continue to plan for the release of the new revision, which has received high marks from our external evaluators.
6. New tenants moved into the third floor and coach house apartments. The income from these leases covers the building expenses, providing Urantia Foundation with more funds for book distribution, translations, and education.
7. Work is continuing on the new Android app of _The Urantia Book_. While it is taking longer than anticipated, we are now debugging it in hopes of a winter launch. The difficulty of making the Android app highlights the excellent work and endless hours spent creating the Urantia Book Apple app. If you have an iPhone or iPad and want to read the book from either device, here's the URL for the free app: [apple.co/33SR5cg](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-urantia-book/id298474490).
8. The enhanced English ebook is in the final phases of quality control testing which will further your study of _The Urantia Book_. At our board meeting Ashley Parratore gave a presentation on the e-book's features including _The Urantia Book_, an interactive index, a pronunciation guide, a term list, and a list of all corrections made to the original 1955 text. If you use an e-reader, you'll want this new study tool. We expect to launch it this fall.
9. The April 2020 trimester for UBIS concluded. Fifteen courses were offered, seven in English, four in Spanish, three in French, and one in Portuguese. Classes were completed by 193 students. The trustees approved the addition of Timothy Duffy as co-director of the school.
10. Urantia Foundation's website, urantia.org, is the most visited Urantia website in the world. On the site, you can read the book in 24 languages; use its new and improved search engine; view in-depth studies, videos, and side-byside text comparisons; link to the UBIS website; and so much more. We are in the process of expanding and modernizing the site. You should be seeing many improvements over the next 18 months.
11. JeanMarie Chaise translated _The Urantia Book_ into Esperanto and generously donated his work to Urantia Foundation. A team will be revising it, and it will be published on the website when ready.
12. Creating translations and revisions is a challenging, lengthy, and expensive process. It can take up to 40 years for full completion. In translating and revising, standards and guidelines are vital. The board approved the Translation Committee's guidelines so current and future translators have a road map to follow. Those guidelines are:

- Preserve the voice of the authors of the English text by eliminating elements of personal style and interpretation from a translation.
- Maintain the accuracy of the meaning and intention of the English text while using the grammar, syntax, and semantics of the target language.
- Retain a translation's faithfulness to the inviolate English text by prioritizing it over the beauty of the target language; even while continually enhancing the text's beauty and readability.
- Integrate feedback from target language readers, professional evaluators, and the Manager of Translations to improve the quality of a translation according to the guidelines listed above.
