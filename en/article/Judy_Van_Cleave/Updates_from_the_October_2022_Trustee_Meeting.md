## Cultural Advisory Council

Ms. Krystyna Piasecka presented a moving PowerPoint on the historical, geographical, and cultural evolution of Poland and its people. Through touching videos and her unique perspective, she brought us through millennia weaving throughout their story an enlightened understanding and appreciation of the Polish people and just why their population appears primed to embrace the truths of the fifth epochal revelation. Read Krystyna's article on page 3.
