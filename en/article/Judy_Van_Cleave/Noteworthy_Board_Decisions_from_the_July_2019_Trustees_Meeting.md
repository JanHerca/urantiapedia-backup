## 1. Urantia Book Internet School

Having recently completed its 20th year, the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) has been the longest-lasting school for readers. Registration for the September trimester opened on September 9, and enrollment was robust. Volunteer-led classes in English (6), Spanish (4), French (3), and Portuguese (1) began on Monday, the 23rd. Click here for more information.

To give you a feel for the curriculum, here are some examples of the classes offered:

1. A Journey to Paradise and an Exploration of the Universe of Universes
2. Ministering Spirits of the Local Universe
3. The Final Hours of the Life of Jesus
4. The Infinite One
5. The Nature and Reality of Religion
6. The Thought Adjuster—Our Passport for Eternity

## 2. Arabic Translation under Revision

The Foundation's Arabic translation of _The Urantia Book_ was first completed in the late 1990s. The board voted to proceed with a light revision.

## 3. Partnership with the Pipeline of Light

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship and Urantia Foundation have agreed to a five-year Latin American book placement program. _El Libro de Urantia_ will be provided at no cost to the Pipeline of Light.

## 4. Property Tax Update for 533 Diversey

Since the last president's report, we made progress fixing the 300\% tax increase levied on 533 Diversey. We are optimistic that there will be a positive outcome.

## 5. Board Reports

The board reviewed a) a report from the president and the executive director, b) a financial and an investments report from the treasurer, and c) reports from the Book, Education, Fundraising, Outreach, and Translations Committees.

## 6. Community Relations

Urantia Foundation desires goodwill within the readership community. To that end, leaders from Urantia Association International (UAI), the Urantia Book Fellowship, and Urantia University attended Urantia Foundation's July board meeting via Zoom. Invited and presenting were Chris Wood, president of UAI; Lara Amyx, finance chair and Emilio Coppola, treasurer, of the Fellowship; and Elisabeth Callahan, executive director of UrantiaUniversity.

Each group, including Urantia Foundation, presented their programs and hopes for the future. There was ample time for Q&A by the attendees. As stated in _The Urantia Book_, you can't help but love someone once you understand them. This first exchange was productive and opened the door for future conversations.

## 7. Seminars and Events at 533

The following events will be hosted at 533 Diversey this fall:

- October 11-13: Annual UBIS Administrative Board Meeting
- November 2019: Science Symposium II (live-streamed)
