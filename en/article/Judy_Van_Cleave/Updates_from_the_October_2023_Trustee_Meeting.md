## Operations Overview

## Books

Sales this quarter were the strongest this year—up 7%. Numbers are still down YTD, but this coincides with the trend of the book business worldwide. Such is expected as we move past the banner years of 2020–2022.

We anticipate an upward trend in sales through the remainder of the year, and hope for a strong finish through the holidays.

So far this year, Urantia Foundation has distributed 18,371 Urantia Books worldwide, and the team will continue its work to accomplish the goal of 7% growth over 2022.

## Education

- Registration for the current trimester of Urantia Book International School (UBIS) opened on September 11. Registrars enrolled a total of 207 individuals in 22 courses, which were led by 25 volunteer teacher-facilitators. Courses are offered in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Hungarian, and Polish. The monthly Spotlight Series enjoyed a summer hiatus and resumed in October.

- “The Marriage and Family Adventure! An Online Symposium” is scheduled for Friday and Saturday, June 14–15, 2024. The goal of this event is to offer inspiration and guidance for individuals and families who seek to navigate the complexities of human relationships. So far there are 11 confirmed speakers, with more hoped for. Bill and Share Beasley will serve as emcees. For information, contact [joanne@urantia.org](mailto:joanne@urantia.org).

- The Urantia Study Group Directory team reported that account cleanup has been going smoothly. Taiwan was added to the list of countries with registered study groups. The countries with the most study groups are United States, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Australia, France, the Philippines, South Korea, and Venezuela. There are now registered study groups in 19 languages, with the addition of Turkish and Chinese. The top 5 languages are English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Korean.

## Fundraising and Finances

## Outreach—Mustard Seed Grants Program (MSGP)

## Translations

The board received report No. 100 (!) from Manager of Translations Georges Michelson-Dupont. This report was a regular accounting of the progress, devotion, and challenges encountered by the translators, revisers, and their teams. It included updates on the Chinese, Esperanto, Farsi, and Filipino translations, and the Portuguese revision.

### Spanish Revision Update

The Spanish Revision Strategic Planning Team met with a company of professional evaluators to begin the process of forming reader focus groups. Beginning soon the company will conduct a two-hour session with up to six focus groups. The information gathered will form the basis for a survey to be sent to the readership at large. All Spanish-speaking readers of _El libro de Urantia_ are welcome to register for participation in a focus group by clicking on this link: [https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7568967/prod-1](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7568967/prod-1). We would like to have representatives from the entire Spanish-speaking world.
