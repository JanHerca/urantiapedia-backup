## The $320,000 Year-end Fundraising Drive

Urantia Foundation has been challenged by four anonymous benefactors to raise $320,000 between now and December 31, 2013. These donors have pledged $160,000 in matching funds.

This means your donations will be doubled, dollar-fordollar, until we reach our goal of $320,000. The Foundation needs this money to insure the budgetary needs are met.

## Urantia Books

Book sales for the first nine months of 2013 were down compared with sales during the same time period in 2012. After researching the book industry, we learned that overall sales for books like _The Urantia Book_ are down about ten percent for the year. In addition, eBook sales for the entire book industry are slowing for the first time since they became available. The good news is that Urantia Book sales rallied in October. Even so, this year may prove difficult in reaching our annual sales goal of a seven percent increase.

Urantia Foundation has launched its annual holiday sale featuring hardcover books for \$17.95 with free shipping in the USA as compared with the suggested retail price of $24.95. Cases of ten books are $139 with free shipping in the USA as compared with the normal retail price of $250. You can choose either or both the new “tree of life” and “world” book-cover designs.

The blue and white LeatherSoft &trade; books are also on sale for $27.95 with free shipping in the USA as compared with the suggested retail price of $39.95. Cases of five books are $125 compared with $200. To order, please visit www.urantia.org/products.

We have lowered the price of books to encourage you to place books in youth hostels, hotels, restaurants, nursing homes, hospitals, cruise ships, and other places that have informal lending libraries. Readers might also buy these inexpensive books and re-sell them to used bookstores. With the bankruptcies and closings of many large book retailers, used bookstores have gained a vital role in the distribution of books.

The board approved the price reduction of the English eBook edition of The Urantia Book from $8.95 to $4.95. The second revision of the French translation is nearing completion and will be printed in mid-2014.

## Revision of the Spanish Translation

The Spanish revision team consisting of Víctor GarcíaBory, Carmelo Martínez, Olga López, Aníbal Pacheco, and Raúl Pujol met face-to-face on November 15, 16, and 17 at 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago. Since the revisers live in the Americas and Spain, most of their work has been done via the internet. They cherished their time together, as they are finishing revising the last few papers of Part II and will soon start revising Part III of _The Urantia Book_. They have completed their revision through Paper 47, including the Foreword.

## Renovation of the Third Floor, Attic, and Carriage House

New plumbing and electrical wiring have been installed on the third floor. New oak floors were laid, sheet rock hung, bathrooms rebuilt and added, and the kitchen completely renovated. Renovation of the third floor will be completed by the end of December with plans to rent it in January or February.

Renovation of the coach house (otherwise known as the garage and garage apartment) has begun and should be finished by the end of February.

## Associate Trustees Elected for Another Term

Associate Trustees are reelected every year. We are pleased to report that Ralph Zehr and Marta Elders were re-elected as associate trustees.
