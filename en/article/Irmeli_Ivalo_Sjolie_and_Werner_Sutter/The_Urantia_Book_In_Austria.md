_By Irmeli Ivalo-Sjölie, Associate Trustee, Helsinki, Finland \& Werner Sutter, British Columbia, Canada_

For the first time Das Urantia Buch was introduced in Austria. It has been available in Germany and Switzerland since the first printing became available in 2006. In both countries there are study groups and many interested readers.

However, since there were no readers in Austria, we decided to attend an “Esoteric Fair” in Vienna last October to introduce _The Urantia Book_. The second printing of the German translation was recently the text is easier to read.

At the fair, we were pleased to notice that a constant flow of people stopped at our booth. discussed the teachings with Werner. Some of them had been reading Das Urantia Buch on the internet and were already familiar with the teachings.

Werner gave two lectures that were well attended, and the people participated by asking Many of them sat down and questions.

We sold the six books that we had with us and referred prospective readers to book stores where they could order the book. In this way the bookstores will find it profitable to have the book on their shelves!

We feel that it was a worthwhile effort, that study groups will start forming in the near future, and that Austria will join the other German-speaking countries.
