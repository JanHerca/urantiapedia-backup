For the second year the Spanish El Libra de Urantia will be exhibited in the Guadalajara Book Fair from November 24th to December 2nd, 2018. “La Feria Internacional del Libro” in Guadalajara, Mexico is the largest book fair of Spanish publishers in the world, with more than 700,000 people in attendance last year. 

Agustin Arellano is coordinating volunteers and has made the necessary arrangements to secure Booth N25 at the fair. The International Fellowship Committee is covering the cost of the booth and volunteer lodging. Nine volunteers will be on hand during the fair to sell or gift 100 El Libra de Urantia books, 120 secondary works, thousands of spiritual vitamins, and 30 posters. But perhaps most importantly, they will be engaging tens of  thousands of fair attendees in discussions about God, Jesus, the gospel, and other fascinating facts and spiritual truths from our Fifth Epochal Revelation.

The “El Libro de Urantia” booth is number N25, so please stop by if you are in Guadalajara during those dates. If you'd like to give money so we may purchase more books and attend other international book fairs, please donate to the Urantia Book Fellowship specifying that the gift goes to the International Fellowship Committee.
