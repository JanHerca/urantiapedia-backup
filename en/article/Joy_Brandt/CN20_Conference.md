Wow! What a wonderful conference! Before the Congreso I had thought that I might become bored with such a long Zoom event, which lasted four hours per day for three days. But actually, the content of the speeches was so interesting, the participants were so friendly, and the conference had so much variety that I remained fascinated throughout the entire three days! I felt like I was taking classes in the Melchizedek University of Salvington!

Each day the Zoom conference began early with everyone's smiling faces and the opportunity to express friendly greetings to each other. The talks were given by people from many different countries and on a variety of fascinating topics, including love and service, the morontia worlds, the mind, mental health, UFOs, Fellowship programs, myths and religious history, celestial artisans, etc. Each day we had prayers and music which uplifted our spirits and brought us together as united brothers and sisters celebrating the birth of Jesus and the Fatherhood of God. It was an amazing experience! I really loved how, after each talk or musical offering, the Zoom meeting was opened up for comments or questions from the audience. This is something that would be too time-consuming to do at inperson plenaries, but it was a surprising and wonderful way to end each presentation on Zoom.

Agustin Arellano, conference organizer and leader, did a superb job of directing the Congreso, keeping it moving at a good pace, and providing lots of variety. Besides speeches, we had performances by professional musicians Cristina Seaborn and Pato Banton, artwork, videos, Power Point presentations, live translation into English and Spanish (accolades go to Serapis Murillo for his outstanding work), opportunities for audience participation, and even a raffle. In addition, Agustin mailed out kits of Urantian goodies (t-shirts, backpack, etc.) just like we would receive if we had been attending an in-person conference.

All in all, it was an exceptional experience that drew $40+$ participants together from 10 or more different countries and at least 3 different languages into a brotherhood team of people, all who are willing and eager students, teachers, servers, and loving children of our heavenly Father. Thank you, Agustin, and all the participants and volunteers who worked so long and hard to make this international Congreso CN20 such a marvelous experience!!!
