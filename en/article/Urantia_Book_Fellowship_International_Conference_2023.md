The Urantia Book Fellowship is delighted to be hosting the next international conference for Urantia Book readers, live and in-person, July 24-28, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The theme is “Living the Teachings: Heart, Mind, and Soul.”

To watch our thirty-three second promo video, or to find out more details about the conference, navigate to [urantiabook.org/ic23/#ic23vid](https://urantiabook.org/ic23/#ic23vid).

The location, Oakbrook Hills Resort and Conference Center, is about a half hour from Chicago's two major airports (O'Hare/ORD and Midway/MDW) and offers comfy beds, a beautiful pool and golf course, and for one week next summer, will be home to hundreds of your closest friends.

Please plan to join us for this wonderful (cosmic) family reunion.
