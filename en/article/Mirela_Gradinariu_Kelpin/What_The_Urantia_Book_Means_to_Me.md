_By Mirela Gradinariu-Kelpin, Sulzbach, Germany_

What does _The Urantia Book_ mean to me? I can answer this question best by describing the effect it has had on me.

But first I would like to tell you how this book came to appear in my life. I found _The Urantia Book_ at the very moment when I was ready to accept it, when my thirst for knowledge could no longer be satisfied by the practice of religion. Years of searching through various Christian cults had brought me great disappointment. But in my heart, even while thinking that perhaps this was all there was, I still could not stop looking for something more.

What was I seeking? Answers to my questions about God, faith, the universe, the meaning of life, and finally our destiny. Life without a meaningful sequel seemed just a waste to me; such a universe must be pointless.

When I finally held the book in my hands and excitedly began to read it, I found myself amazed over and over again. The wonderful teachings of the fifth revelation have nurtured me, broadened my cosmic vision, increased my understanding, deepened my spiritual values, strengthened my faith, and made my life replete. I am infinitely grateful to be able to study it, discuss it with like-minded people, and exchange opinions with them.

The book enlightened me with answers to all my questions and more besides: questions I had not even known I should be asking. That is why one might call it the “Encyclopedia of the Universe.” Of course, it is, first and always, undisputedly the fifth revelation!

This book's focus on the golden rule, on love, truth, beauty, and goodness, stabilizes the personality and is the key to the highest-quality interpersonal relationships. The book has revealed to me the divine gifts that each of us possesses. But first and foremost is the knowledge of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and that God's attitude toward all his children and his creations throughout the universe of universes is benevolent—GOD IS LOVE.

It is exhilarating to know that each of us has a part in the divine plan, with the help of God's divine spark within us: “and not ours, but your will be done.” It is an honor and privilege to experience and understand these truths of the universe and the Creator during our earthly life—as much as our limited mortal conception allows.

My wish is that more and more people will “discover” this book for themselves, because it offers the best opportunity for both peace and a transformed world.
