_By Annie Spiars, Fort Lauderdale, Florida_

A touch of green amidst the snow, 
The first crocus-harbinger of spring.
Stirs the soul and lets it know
The beauty that is following.
Like the opening bud, hope quivers,
Then hurries right along
To join the singing, gushing rivers
In swelling joyous song!

Summer follows in its wake,
And like a blossoming, first romance,
Fragile lilies on the lake
Whisper softly, “Take a chance!”
The full moon in its ethereal flight,
The soft sounds of the turtle dove,
The longings, yearnings in the night
Murmurs back, “I Love! I Love!”

Flaring brightly as they fall,
The autumn leaves ciepart,
Reminiscing we recall
The memories that touched our heart.
Secreted carefully away,
To look back on tomorrow,
Brought forth upon another day
To help us ease the sorrow!

Life and season left behind,
Loneliness is now our share
Never more can we re-find
The ones and things we had there.
We're in the winter of our life,
No more our footsteps roam,
We pause and rest from all our strife
Until HE comes to take us home.
