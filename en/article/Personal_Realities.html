Personal Realities

"Spirit is the basic personal reality in the universes, and personality is basic to all progressing experience with spiritual reality. Every phase of personality experience on every successive level of universe progression swarms with clues to the discovery of alluring personal realities. Man's true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of nonmaterial value." (141)

Of the multitude of inspiring revelatory statements in the Urantia Papers, is this not among the most meaningful?

There is something grand and ineffable about the statement that our true destiny is to create new and spirit goals for our daily livingâ€”and to then pursue their fulfillment.

"True destiny" has to be greater than, but inclusive of, our temporary dwelling time on this planet. However, since we are advised to seek to "serve as we pass by," and "to take no anxious thought," it would appear that the goals we set ourselves should be located in the here and now. They should be supernal and of spirit rather than of material value.

The Papers also advise us of the importance of "being" before "doing," meaning that we have to "be righteous" or to "be loving" before acts implying righteousness or love actually take on spiritual value.

See the article "What Really Survives" for enlightenment on spirit goals.
