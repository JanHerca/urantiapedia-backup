“Master, I have a basket of figs, bread and drink for your journey,” said John Mark, the apostles' errand boy. John Markwas always looking after the group, so it was not unusual that he wanted Jesus to have provisions for his walk.

Jesus reached for the basket, but John Mark didn't let go. There they stood, Jesus and John Mark holding the basket.

“Let me carry it for you,” said John Mark. "You might set it down while you pray and forget about it. If I go along, you won't have to worry and can freely worship.

“I won't ask any questions and promise to be silent.”

Some of the bystanders took notice of how intently John Mark was talking with Jesus as both still held the basket.

After a moment, Jesus let go and said: “Since with all your heart you wish to come along, I cannot deny you. You may ask me any question you like and we'll share the burden of the basket.”

As they left the camp, John Mark walked beside Jesus with a smile stretched across his face. When they reached the hilltop, they saw Jerusalem in the distance. They continued over the ridge and into a valley. Since they were alone on this hike, John Mark took the opportunity to share his thoughts.

“Master,” he said, as Jesus sat down on a boulder to rest. “My ambition is to be like the apostles. If only I could have spent more time with you, I might have learned how to talk to the multitudes. I need more training. You can correct misunderstandings in my heart and show me how to speak of the kingdom so that all can understand. There is so much I wish to do for you. But I feel I'm not ready. And now you say you will be leaving us.”

“I can depend on you doing important things for the kingdom after I am away,” Jesus said. “So I am not concerned.'”

“But had I been an apostle,” John Mark insisted, “I might have learned so much more.”

“John Mark, you have always made wise use of your time,” Jesus said. “I know whenever you can, you are nearby listening. You have learned much, but it is not only what you have heard that assures me. It is your character that gladdens me. You are more capable than you know.”

They sat quietly for a while. John Mark handed Jesus food from the basket. He was still wrestling with the thought of Jesus leaving.

John Mark remembered when he first joined Jesus and the apostles. He had introduced his friend Amos to Jesus. Amos and John Mark both desired to follow Jesus and the apostles. Theywere young, but although Amos believed in the kingdom, his parents would not consent. He couldn't join the Apostles. Amos had even considered running away from home, but he didn't want to hurt his parents.

“Your parents were wise as well as loving,” said Jesus, seeming to read John Mark's thoughts. “They did not make you choose between service to God and loyalty to family. They allowed you to have these valuable experiences. And although your parents are wealthy, they never spoiled you.”

After more hiking through the hills, John Mark and Jesus stopped to catch their breath and admire the view before starting back to the camp.

John Mark's thoughts strayed back to earlier that morning. At breakfast in the camp, everyone had been thinking over recent events.

During the last week Jesus had told the apostles that the time had come to join the Father and be about his business in Heaven. He had promised to return some time in the future, but talk of his return confused the apostles more than it assured them. They were distraught. Not a word had been spoken that morning; then Jesus broke the silence.

“I intend to be absent today so that I may commune with the Father. I desire that you rest and think about what I have told you.”

David Zebedee, brother of the Apostles James and John Zebedee, thought it was too dangerous for Jesus to venture away by himself. He knew the Jerusalem rulers were trying to capture Jesus. He wanted to send three armed men along for his protection, but Jesus refused the offer.

“Thanks, my friend,” Jesus said. “But these men may not come with me. I wish to be alone. Besides, no harm will come to me.”

As Jesus had tumed and started to leave the camp, John Mark seized the moment. He had hurried to Jesus with the basket of bread, figs and drink. At last, Jesus had given in and allowed him to come along.

In the past few years, Jesus had often been surrounded by multitudes. Sometimes he spent time alone with the apostles, but rarely did one of the disciples and followers have a chance to be alone with him while he communed with the Father.

On this day in the hills, John Mark was envied by the apostles and disciples. He was able to spend hours alone with Jesus. Later in life, John Mark would often remember this day.

It would be the last day of rest for Jesus before he was crucified. John Mark didn't know at the time that, as an older man, he would write one of the four gospels filled with his memories of Jesus and the apostles.

Nor was John Mark aware of the angels who were watching Jesus' every move. In the worlds on high, this day became known as the day a young man spent with God in the hills.
