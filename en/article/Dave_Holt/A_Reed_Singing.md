I am just a reed..
You will not notice me here.
While still a seed,
I found myself lodged
in a patch of hard earth.
When a trickle of water
discovered my hiding place,
my roots took hold.

More rain fell;
it flowed gloriously
around my pale root and tender sprout.
I clung to this harsh slope,
facing south,
I was given sunshine,
and I grew.

I am just a reed, nothing to you.
Not even one transformed by human hands
into a flute, making music.
But when a marine gale
sweeps across the wind-bitten hill,
blowing between our long stems,
even reeds will sing.

It is then that we praise
the Lord of our creation,
for we seem of small consequence,
yet we have life.
It is precious,
and we give praise.

Donner Canyon, Mount Diablo
