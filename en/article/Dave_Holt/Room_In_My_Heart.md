There is a spacious place inside my heart that waits, 
wanting you to come and stay,
an empty room inside the house I’m sweeping out, 
where you’ll abide forever I pray.

The sunlight shimmers on a stucco wall, 
rippling through the leaves.
It lights a space that meditation seeks, 
a quiet place where shadows play.

Now since you broke my darkness with a golden ray, 
sunlight that came piercing through,
I’ve seen this life was always in such disarray 
true purpose I just never knew.

The dust and cobwebs of confusion too
are being swept away.
And in this house anticipation gleams,
knowing it’s been prepared for you.
