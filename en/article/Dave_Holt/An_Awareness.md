"Exploring on a sunlit morning, in the front yard, 
safe outside from what lay behind
the living room window where anxieties crouched, 
ready to spring, I wandered near my mother's
flagstone flower beds of forsythia, daffodils, tulips, 
trying to forget trouble, sadness and quarrels.

I was touched by feelings I could not describe, 
lifted by a caring hand, my heart soothed, 
assurances of guidance into the future, a sense 
of purpose, the person I was meant to become, 
discoveries that empowered my future.
... the memory told me I could
gradually learn to conquer uncertainties, 
make small accomplishments."
