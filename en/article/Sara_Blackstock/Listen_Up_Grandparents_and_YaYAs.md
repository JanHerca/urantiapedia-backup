Parents of today and those to come who have found the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to be essential to their spiritual development NEED your experience, your suggestions, your mentoring. To pass on what you have learned is actually a principle found at all levels of our universe career. Many of us who are long time “UBers” were on our own as we attempted to pass the truths of _The Urantia Book_ to our children. We did it by the seat of our pants with various levels of success. There is now a generation of grandparents, and the younger generation who you raised, who can benefit measurably by your willingness to share some of your experiences. 

Even a short answer to the following questions could be instructive: 

1. If you raised your children with the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, what were the methods you felt were most receptive by your children: reading stories from _The Urantia Book_, telling stories, sending them to Sunday school, bringing them to conferences, having a study group in your home, or other methods? 
2. What methods did not work? Perhaps even turned you off from _The Urantia Book_? 
3. Children talk about God, heaven, hell, angels, the devil, good and evil. How did your children socialize the teachings? Did they have other children with whom they could share these concepts, or were they isolated within the sometimes specialized language of _The Urantia Book_? 
4. If your partner was not involved in _The Urantia Book_, how did you work out what would be taught to your children? 
5. What rituals or ceremonies, if any, were a part of your home life? 
6. Are your children involved with _The Urantia Book_ currently? Do they attend a church? Have they left the teachings to the side? Are they just not interested in religion? Have they found another path for spiritual fulfillment? 
7. If you were raised in a home where your parent/s embraced _The Urantia Book_, what did you experience in your home which illustrated and taught the truths of life? What created a desire in you to continue to embrace _The Urantia Book_ teachings? 
8. If as a child growing up in a home where stories and terminology from _The Urantia Book_ were used in normal, daily interaction, did you find it difficult to interact with peers who knew nothing about Fandors or Lucifer or Adam and Eve, or life on other planets, for example? 
9. If you grew up in a home with parents who “inculcated” you into _The Urantia Book_ teachings, if/when you have children what methods would you NOT recommend to parents as they desire to share _The Urantia Book_? 
10. What were at least three of the most memorable truths emphasized in your home, or that you emphasized as a parent? 
11. Jesus told his apostles: _“It is not so important that you should know about the fact of God as that you should increasingly grow in the ability to feel the presence of God.”_ [UB 155:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_12) How did you as a parent embrace this truth in your home, or if you grew up in a home where your parents were aware of this, how did they provide the environment for this “feeling” as differentiated from “the fact of God”?
