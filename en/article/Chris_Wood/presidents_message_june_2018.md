I was recently reading Paper 44 of _The Urantia Book_, studying the Celestial Artisans. We are informed about the “harmony of associated spirits” which is the arrangements of various and different beings so that they produce “majestic melodies.” This idea of the harmony within a group captures so well what I have witnessed across the Urantia community these last few months.

There is now a recognizable tune to our expanding service as new patches of Urantia Book students emerge across the globe. Our Dissemination Committee helps us find others who would become inspired by this revelation. Our Membership Committee is experienced in reaching out to these new pockets of truth seekers, helping to unite with isolated students and regional groups. Our Study Groups Committee brings regular and focused study into our communities, and our Conference Committee helps create meaningful events. Our Education Committee sources out and presents quality in-depth lessons from across the globe, and our Communications Committee connects all of us within the global Urantia community. Of course our Translations Committee makes all of this connecting more far-reaching with their loving dedication to bridging language barriers.

The harmony of this united effort hums louder every year. And what an exciting time for our expanding Urantia Association! These last few months have seen a Triennial International Conference, an African Continental Conference in Accra, Ghana, and _The Urantia Book_ represented in Bogota, Colombia, at one of the largest book fairs in Latin America. We can look ahead to the November Latin American Conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the 2019 European Conference in Tallin, Estonia and the next International Conference in the Sacred Valley of the Incas in Peru in 2021.

Every new project has an amazing story behind it, and every new believer in this revelation could fill chapters with their journey. But when I take it all in, all together—when I witness and contemplate the global melody emerging from the Urantia community—all I can do is be overcome by the harmony buzzing across the world. And as our personal connections stir that music of the soul, we can all raise our voices and join in.

In service,  
Chris Wood
