_Brotherhood is impossible on a world whose inhabitants are so primitive that they fail to recognize the folly of unmitigated selfishness. There must occur an ***exchange of national and racial literature***. Each race must become familiar with the thought of all races; each nation must know the feelings of all nations. Ignorance breeds suspicion, and suspicion is incompatible with the essential attitude of sympathy and love._ <a id="a40_431"></a>[[UB 52:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_4)] emphasis added

This year I have had the honor of travelling to The Netherlands, Ghana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Mexico for Urantia activities, in addition to events across my home country of the United States. Of course, there are many things that are universal across all cultures, but one thing has struck me about our expanding Urantia community: those of us who love _The Urantia Book_ also love books in general. We are, by and large, a group with a passion for reading.

In preparation for my travels, I set a goal of reading at least one novel by a native author set in each country I was to visit. I wanted to become better familiar with the thoughts, feelings and arts of the nations I was hoping would welcome me. In Paper 52 (Planetary Mortal Epochs) section 6 (Urantia’s Post-Bestowal Age) we are given a list of five tasks we can dedicate ourselves to in this day and generation. The one most easily accomplished, I believe, is the exchange of literature.

In this holiday season we often celebrate by giving each other gifts. Might I suggest that we make a habit to share books from across the world with our friends and family? It will be a small step to help spread the goals of the Urantia revelation.

A new year is a time for renewal and change. Our International Service Board is in the middle of an election cycle that will welcome new volunteers into at least four of our board seats. We need new volunteers on our committees to help the new leaders transition into the global service they are preparing to undertake. I highly encourage each member of the Association to volunteer for some service at the local, national or international level.

Thank you for a wonderful year and I look forward to the continued expansion of Urantia Association International and the global Urantia Community. May you all have a happy and safe Christmas and New Year.

In service,  
Chris Wood
