Recently, a group of four young Urantia Book students stayed with me and my family for a weekend and of course they wanted to be of service. What task did we set upon this nurse, engineering student, and two small businessmen? They spent eight hours folding letters and preparing our fall fundraiser for the post office. Time itself is often the most valuable gift.

At my local church there was a presentation of “stewardship” which focused on Time, Talent and Treasure. Of course my mind turned to the Urantia Community. The Publication Mandate tells us, “The Book belongs to the era immediately to follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle.” Our generation is a stewardship generation. I know the vast amount of time Urantia Book students give to build our community. Ten of thousands of hours each week are dedicated to building study groups, placing books in libraries, negotiating shipping to Africa, and, yes, folding letters.

I am reminded of the parable of the Good Samaritan. A man has been attacked and many people turn down the opportunity to help. The Samaritan comes along and he gives his Time – he stops what he is doing and spends the night nursing the man back to health; he gives his Talent – providing immediate comfort and dressing the man’s wounds; and he give his Treasure – paying the innkeeper to give further aid to the man promising to pay any additional bills that might arise.

Toward the end of the year we are all asked to take stock of what Time, Talent, and Financial support we have to offer to the Urantia Community. If you can, I encourage you to visit the website of Urantia Association International to find out more about volunteer opportunities and to donate online.

I am very grateful for all opportunity to help shape and direct the contributions of this community. Together we are spreading the teaching of _The Urantia Book_ and helping to bring humankind closer to God.

In service,  
Chris Wood
