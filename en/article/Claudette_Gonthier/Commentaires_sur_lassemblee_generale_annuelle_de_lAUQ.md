_Claudette Gonthier_
secretary of the AUQ

On May 5, 2024, our annual general meeting of the Urantia Association of Quebec took place at the Hôtel le Dauphin in Drummondville. We would like to thank the 25 people including the five participants on Zoom for attending this meeting. The agenda was rather busy. The report on activities for the year 2023 was given, as well as upcoming projects for the year 2024. Marc Belleau, our treasurer, presented to us, always with his usual great professionalism, the financial report for the year 2023.

There were two elections during this assembly. Claudette Gonthier will continue her role as secretary for a new term. Robert Cadieux was elected without opposition to the position of vice-president.

This meeting took place in fraternity. The love was palpable in the room for this in-person meeting long desired by all participants. The relational exchanges were numerous.

At the end of the meeting, Gaétan Charland, our president of the Association, offered us a conference entitled “Spiritual unity and us”. We shared on the subject and very nice comments arose on this spiritual unity. The Spirit of Truth was certainly there!

In my opinion, I found it very inspiring to be able to share in person. Especially to let God manifest himself through us for the love of others.

Several people that I saw only on Zoom were present at this assembly. So I was able to shake their hands and kiss them. It is important to live, as Gaétan said so well, this spiritual unity in our lives every day, and this with our spiritual brothers and sisters.

We are all children of God in this beautiful and great adventure. May this peace and joy which animated this day continue daily in our prayers, our adoration and our meditations.
