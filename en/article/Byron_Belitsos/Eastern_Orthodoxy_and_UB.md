Slowly but surely, _The Urantia Book_ is becoming more widely disseminated within Christendom. As we watch its reception by liberal Protestants, and a few Catholics, a fascinating question arises concerning its future impact on Eastern Orthodox Christians.

Drawing upon human and superhuman sources, the Urantia Papers claim to provide the true story of the life of the historic Jesus. But how do these writings square with the beliefs of the historic _church_, whose founders actually _witnessed_ Jesus' life? The Eastern Church traces its bishops and its “Holy Tradition” in an unbroken line back to these earliest believers — even to the Apostles themselves who first preached at Jerusalem and Antioch. How then should _Urantia Book_ readers regard this ancient institution, whose patriarchs still sit in Jerusalem and Antioch? Conversely, on what basis might Orthodox Christians approach this claim of a new and strange revelation of the life of Jesus? Are there points of contact between Orthodoxy and _The Urantia Book_, or are the two anathema to one another?

> _Drawing upon human and superhuman sources, the Urantia Papers claim to provide the true story of the life of the historic Jesus. But how do these writings square with the beliefs of the historic church, whose founders actually witnessed Jesus'life?_

## The Rising Importance of Orthodoxy

Such questions are more important now than ever. One obvious reason is the collapse of communism in the primary sphere of the Eastern Orthodox Church: Russia and Eastern Europe. After decades of repression, these countries have a significant opportunity to reconstruct their faiths.

On a recent visit to Russia, I witnessed churches that had once fallen into neglect now filled to overflowing: I spoke with people from all walks of life who were involved in a passionate reappropriation of Russia's rich Orthodox tradition. One is a professor who lives in Moscow, a former Communist Party member who is now an Orthodox convert. He has recently discovered and embraced _The Urantia Book_ as well, finding a strong affinity between the two faiths. Another friend in Moscow, a magazine publisher who has been in dialogue with the Urantia community, is now deeply involved in a complicated project to rebuild a historic church in the center of Moscow. Once an atheist with no interest in religion, she is now a practicing Orthodox believer.

In the U.S., Orthodox Christian communities are growing in membership, unlike many other church denominations, now that they are emerging from their old-world ethnicity. There is also a significant movement of converts from Protestantism to Orthodoxy. In 1987 the bulk of the membership of the evangelical Campus Crusade for Christ converted to Orthodoxy. Other evidence of the growing interest of Protestants is a remarkable new book documenting the conversion to Orthodoxy of eighteen former clergy from diverse Protestant backgrounds. [^1]

> _In the U.S., Orthodox Christian communities are growing in membership, unlike many other church denominations, now that they are emerging from their old-world ethnicity. There is also a significant movement of converts from Protestantism to Orthodoxy._

Scholars and journalists are also giving more notice to Orthodoxy. Karen Armstrong's best-seller $A$ History of God, (Knopf, 1993) gives especially sympathetic treatment to the tradition. According to an article in the _Utme Reader_ on the current revival of Orthodoxy, Armstrong notes that Orthodoxy “is rooted in mystery and paradox, rather than legalistic do's and don'ts....Eastern Orthodoxy has a rich tradition of mystical practice that Armstrong refers to as a ‘Christian Yoga’.”[^2]

## Is _The Urantia Book_ Protestant?

When most reader-believers of _The Urantia Book_ think of dialoguing with Christians, they often look to liberal or mainline Protestant churches. At first glance this seems quite sensible, for it certainly requires an environment free of dogmatism to be able to hear talk of a “new revelation.”

Some might also argue that the Book itself is part of the stream of liberal Protestant thought, or at least most consistent with it. For example, it is generally “fideist.” as is the Protestant tradition. It attacks ecclesiasticism and criticizes ceremonialism and sacramentalism, although it does institute a new form of the Eucharist in the “sacrament of the remembrance.”(<a id="a58_375"></a>[UB 179:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_5)) And it appears to praise the Protestant Reformation by referring to it in several passages as a “rehabilitation” and “rejuvenation” and even a “resurrection” of the church. (See [Paper 195, “After Pentecost.”](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195))

Still, there are many important elements in the Book's teachings that lend themselves to interface with Orthodoxy. Eastern Orthodox theology today has strengths where liberal Protestant thought has weaknesses. For example, there is a rising tendency in seminaries to question the divinity of Jesus, to deconstruct the transcendence of the divine, to abandon Trinitarian theology. By contrast, the staunch Orthodox adherence to the sacred traditions of historic Christianity may open doors to dialogue, for the Urantia revelation strongly affirms the historic Christian faith in the Incarnation and the Trinity.

Mystical traditions are not lacking in Protestantism and certainly not in Catholicism, but Orthodoxy contains a vast, rich, and unbroken tradition of mystical theology and practice which is of direct lineage from the early church. One evidence is the superb collection of Orthodox mystical writings known as the _Philokalia_, the cream of over a thousand years of experiential mysticism. [^3]

The Eastern church inherited the fullness of the “desert spirituality” tradition of the early church mystics and ascetics, which harkens back so vividly to the prophetic strain of Judaism. Magnificent liturgy, resplendent symbolism, mystical art, and experiential religion have always had a privileged place in Orthodox religiosity.

## The Doctrinal Basis for Dialogue

One beginning place for dialogue would be Eastern Orthodox doctrine. It may amaze many Orthodox believers to discover that the doctrines of the Church “Fathers” (or,“Patristics”) that required centuries to evolve are affirmed as generally _correct_ by _The Urantia Book_. This strong link at the doctrinal level means to me that both Orthodox believers and adherents of _The Urantia Book_ have much to share and much to learn from each other.

> _One beginning place for dialogue would be Eastern Orthodox doctrine. It may amaze mam Orthodox believers to discover that the doctrines of the Church “Fathers” (or, “Patristics”) that required centuries to evolve are affirmed as generally conrect by_ The Urantia Book.

There are perhaps three key elements of Orthodox belief: the theology of the Trinity, the doctrine of the Incarnation, and the worshipful veneration of icons. The first two are strongly echoed and amplified in the teachings of _The Urantia Book_; and I personally find that the devotional use of icons that pervades the Eastern churches provides a “satisfying symbolism” that can “symbolize that which is permanent in the presence of unceasing change.” (See “The Nature of Cultism,” <a id="a72_483"></a>[UB 87:7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7))

The core beliefs of Orthodoxy were spelled out in the Seven Ecumenical Councils of the early centuries of Christianity, which met between A.D. 325 and 787 [^4]. The great Patristic age of speculative mystical theology is long over, but latent in “Holy Tradition” are images, practices, and doctrines that can easily lend themselves to creative development. For example, a great revival of Russian Orthodoxy in the 19th century that was induced (at least in part) by the translation of _The Philokalia_ into Russian quickly reached new heights of innovative theology (such as Soloviev, Bulgakov, and Berdayev) and of religious art (such as Dostoevsky). The creative theology of this period in Russia even anticipated _later_ developments in the West such as process theology (which has a strong affinity with _The Urantia Book_'s concept of the Supreme Being) and the re-integration of feminine images of deity in Soloviev's school of “sophiology” (which echoes important themes in _The Urantia Book_). It is very possible that a world renaissance of Orthodox life and thought might have followed in the 20th century had this revival not been stamped out by Lenin and Stalin.

## Christology and Trinity

But let us return to the original period of creative Orthodox theology. It seems a miracle that the theologians of the early church were able to establish philosophically the truth that Jesus was “homoousius” (one in essence) with the Father, while also _fully_ human. We are told in _The Urantia Book_ that without the valiant efforts of one of these Greek “Fathers” of the Church, this great and saving truth would have been lost:

> Christianity owes much, very much, to the Greeks. It was a Greek, from Egypt, who so bravely stood up at Nicaea and so fearlessly challenged this assembly that it dared not soobscure the concept of the nature of Jesus that the real truth of his bestowal might have been in danger of being lost to the world. This Greek's name was Athanasius, and but for the eloquence and the logic of this believer, the persuasions of Arius would have triumphed. (<a id="a80_450"></a>[UB 195:0.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_18))

The historical record shows that Athanasius led the Council of Nicaea (325) to repudiate Arianism (the belief that God the Son is fundamentally inferior to God the Father) and to adopt the view that Jesus as Son was “light from light, true God of true God,” that is, ontologically equal to the Father.

Amazingly, the earliest Christians arrived at a doctrine of the Trinity that also matches in key points that of _The Urantia Book_. Again, this was not achieved by direct revelation but through the same circuitous, evolutionary route as the dogma of the Incarnation. Several centuries of doctrinal debate were necessary because, according to _The Urantia Book_, Jesus' teachings to his Apostles about the true nature of the Trinity were lost.

> Jesus taught his apostles the truth regarding the persons of the Paradise Trinity, but they thought he spoke figuratively and symbolically...The first Trinity of Christianity was proclaimed at Antioch and consisted of God. his Word. and his Wisdom... The Christian concept of the Trinity, which began to gain recognition near the close of the first century after Christ, was comprised of the Universal Father, the Creator Son...and the Mother Spirit...(<a id="a86_455"></a>[UB 104:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p1_12)) [Emphasis added]

Of course, all of these concepts were finally codified in the Nicene Creed in 325. 

In addition, in Constantinople in 381, the Second Council spoke more clearly of the Holy Spirit as equal to the other two Persons, and is “...worshipped together with the Father and the Son.” This essential teaching of the equality of the third person of the Trinity is also affirmed and greatly expanded by _The Urantia Book_. [^5]

As a side note, it is regrettable that the Wisdom or “Sophia” concept of the earliest Christian Trinitarians at Antioch (see emphasis, last quote) faded into the lost pages of early church history. This image of Sophia is in certain ways an accurate depiction of the local universe Mother Spirit concept of _The Urantia Book_. By the fourth century, Sophia was largely dropped in favor of the genderless Holy Spirit, or merged into the rising cult of Mary, the Theotokos (“God-bearer” or “Mother of God”). But there is great hope that she will be retrieved. As we noted previously, through the visionary theology of Vladimir Soloviev, a school of Orthodox “sophiology” arose in Russia in the nineteenth century to explore this ancient notion once again, and this revivified Sophia concept is, curiously, enjoying a renaissance both in Russia today and in the United States among eco-feminist thinkers and creation theologians. Is it possible that creative Orthodox theologians might someday revive the cultic basis for the veneration of the Mother Spirit and even the Infinite Mother Spirit?

> _As a side note, it is regrettable that the Wisdom or “Sophia” concept of the earliest Christian Trinitarians at Antioch (see emphasis, last quote) faded into the lost pages of early church history. This image of Sophia is in certain ways an accurate depiction of the local universe Mother Spirit concept of_ The Urantia Book.

Whatever the case may be, our key point here is that the trinitarianism of the Ecumenical Councils was, according to _The Urantia Book_, “spiritually” correct:

> But though the Christian concept of the Trinity erred in fact, it was practically true with respect to spiritual relationships. (<a id="a98_131"></a>[UB 104:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p1_13))

The Church Fathers' high concept of the Trinity has been preserved intact down to this day in the Eastern Church, especially in its spiritual sense. In no place on earth is this “practically true” concept of the Trinity venerated, worshipped, meditated upon, symbolized, sensed, celebrated, chanted and sung about with as much energy and faith as in Orthodox churches worldwide. “Glory to the Father, and tothe Son, and to the Holy Spirit!” is a constant refrain in the Orthodox liturgy of John Chrysostom, the standard liturgy throughout the Orthodox world.

The liturgy of the Eastern Church creates a cosmic theater for the adoration for the Trinity. It is my view that this exuberant tradition of worship and sy mbolism could continue unbroken if these churches were ever toembrace _The Urantia Book_; it is at least my hope as one who was raised within this tradition. The Eastern Church has also spent the greater part of 2000 years praising God for the gift of the Incarnation, and this is a legacy that could certainly be preserved. I would suggest that such sublime notions of transcendence and immanence need only be supplemented by the new narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus in order to create a robust new religion for the 21st century.

## Two Views of Salvation

Few Christians realize that there is a wide divergence between the ancient church and its successor churches in the West (both Catholic and Protestant) in the understanding of how man is saved. By the same token, few _Urantia Book_ readers realize that the soteriology of the Eastern church is closer in spirit to _The Urantia Book_ than that of the Western church.

The differences between East and Westcan be summarized as follows: The Western tradition is essentially the juridicalAugustinian view that since human will is shackled by original sin, we can be saved only by unearned acts of divine grace that are ultimately _predestined_. Calvinism is perhaps its most extreme form, but this Augustinian teaching — along with the closely allied doctrine of blood atonement whose roots are in Paul-has endured in all branches of Western Christianity. Mainline Protestant theologians have only recently abandoned the Augustinian premises of original sin and atonement.

The Eastern position derives from the very different teachings of St. Maximus the Confessor, the seventh century Greek theologian and mystic. Along with St. Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus is one of the systematizers of the essential early church doctrine of _theosis_ (“deification”). Maximus' riew of salvation is summarized below by the distinguished historian, Jaroslav Pelikan:

> An epitome of the contrast is the formula of Maximus: ‘Our salvation finally depends on our own will.’ The dichotomy represented by the antithesis between Pelagianism [the rejected Latin doctrine of salvation by reliance on human will] and Augustinianism was not part of Maximus’ thought. Instead, his doctrine of salvation is based on the idea of participation and of communion that excludes neither grace nor freedom, which were established once and for all in the incarnate Word and his ‘two wills’ [^6]

What is important for us here is that St. Maximus' position on salvation is remarkably close to that of Jesus in _The Urantia Book_. Jesus teaches that salvation is a free gift of God that is freely received. But our free will is not “fallen” or “crippled” in the Augustinian view; human will, says Jesus, is an essential factor in choosing to receive such grace: “I declare that salvation is first a matter of your personal choosing.” (<a id="a114_437"></a>[UB 166:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p3_3)) Elsewhere he says, “The transformations of grace are wrought in response to the living faith of those who are the beneficiaries.”(<a id="a114_612"></a>[UB 150:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p9_2)) Similarly, St. Maximus writes:

> The Spirit does not generate a will that is not willing, but he transforms into deification a will that has the desire [for salvation]. [^7]

According to Pelikan, the continuing legacy of Maximus in the East on the problem of salvation was such that “...the antithesis between divine grace and human freedom, which dogged Western theology for many centuries, did not present a problem in that form for Eastern Christian thought.”[^8]

Thus it should come as no surprise that the Eastern church rejects as simplistic and wrongheaded the juridical implications of the atonement doctrine adhered to in the West. We know, of course, _The Urantia Book_ takes pains to refute the atonement doctrine, calling it “a barbaric idea.” (<a id="a120_290"></a>[UB 4:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_4)) Likewise, the early Fathers _with the exception of Augustine_ did not emphasize the Pauline view that Jesus“ death was a “ransom.”

> _...it should come as no surprise that the Eastern church rejects as simplistic and wrongheaded the juridical implications of the atonement doctrine adhered to in the West._

As we will see in the next section, the Eastem church sees salvation, much as _The Urantia Book_ does, as a continuing process of “progress — growth in grace.” (See <a id="a124_165"></a>[UB 150:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p5_2)) Certainly both teachings would consider a tragic error the simplistic evangelistic Protestant formula that salvation depends on being “born again” by virtue of the belief that “Jesus died for our sins.”

## “Theosis” in Orthodoxy and _The Urantia Book_

In the 60's and 70's, the Campus Crusade for Christ led thousands of college students into the “born again” brand of conversion experience typical of today's evangelical Christianity. A former Crusade leader, Frank Schaeffer, an Orthodox convert, contrasts the born-again experience with Orthodox _theosis_ in his book _Dancing Alone_. Schaeffer was perhaps most responsible for leading the Campus Crusade for Christ into the Orthodox church.

> The American Protestant also looks for a magical instantaneous “silver bullet” solution to sin. He calls this the “born again” experience. But according to Holy Tradition, just saying that one is born again is meaningless. It does not entail the necessary ....use of our free will to choose God's way again and again, which the historical Church taught is the only way we can become like God, to strive to become “deified” — in other words, imitate Christ and through imitation to become God-like ourselves. [^9]
> 
Schaeffer's book is a sustained polemic against the narrowing of the theological horizon that is represented by modern Protestantism when contrasted with Orthodoxy.

The modern Russian theologian, Georges Florovsky, writes: “The ultimate aim and purpose of human life was defined in the Patristic tradition as _theosis_, divinization.” [^10] Similarly, the Jesus of _The Urantia Book_ also urged believers to dare to be God-like, to love with a _fatherly_ love. Much like the central Orthodox doctrine of the progressive “deification,” Jesus taught his followers to engage in a “...glorious progression, to become perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.” (<a id="a134_501"></a>[UB 142:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_13))

Like the other Fathers of the Church, Maximus saw the practice of unceasing prayer (which we will soon examine) as essential to deification. Notably, his teaching on theosis was also incorporated intothe Christology he successfully defended at the Sixth Ecumenical Council in 681. [^11]

Maximus' theological achievement culminates the line of Patristic thought beginning with St. Athanasius and his forbears. Historians now point out that Athanasius' central argument to Council of Nicaea was the basis of the later doctrine of theosis; he declared that if Jesus is not both fully God and fully man, then we _cannot_ logically share in the divine nature. His famous line about the Incarnation epitomizes the Orthodox concept of theosis: “He became man so that man might become God.”

## Hesychasm and Orthodox Spirituality

The Greek Fathers' teaching of theosis is not just a theological abstraction. It is actually the doctrinal expression of a rich tradition within Orthodoxy of specific worshipful practices. Arising from the experiments of the mystics of the early church, these practices are commonly known under the term “hesychasm” or “hesychia.”The literal translation of the Greek word _hesychia_ is “quies” in Latin and “stillness” in English. For the early church, hesychia provided _the_ method of carrying out the Biblical injunction of “unceasing prayer,” which St. Paul urged for all believers.

Bishop Kallistos Ware, Lecturer in Eastern Orthodox Studies at Oxford University, summarizes the practices of hesychasm:

> A hesychast is one whopursues hesychia, innerstillness or silence of the heart, in particular through the use of the Jesus Prayer. This is a short invocation, constantly repeated, usually in the form, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me." Through inner attentiveness and the repetition of this prayer, sometimes accompanied by a physical technique involving the control of breathing, the hesychasts... believed that they attained a vision of divine light and so union with God. [^12]

John Meyendorff explains the real purpose of the prayer to the hesychast: 

> The Jesus prayer is at the center of all hesychast spirituality. The Name of the Incarnate Word is bound up in the essential functions of being: it is present in the “heart,” it is linked to the breath...._The monk is called to become conscious of the actual presence of Jesus in the interior of his own being_.... without any images. [^13] [Emphasis added]

It seems to me that the hesychastic practice of the interior consciousness of the presence of God strongly echoes Jesus in his Second Discourse on Religion in _The Urantia Book_:

> Many of your brethren have minds which accept the theory of God while they spiritually fail to realize the presence of God....It is not so important that you should know about the fact of God as that you should increasingly grow in the ability to feel the _presence of God_. (<a id="a154_278"></a>[UB 155:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_12))

Hesychasm evolved directly out of the “desert” tradition of the earliest Christian anchorites of the fourth century in Egypt and Syria. The desert spirituality of these innovators is regarded by most historians to be the historic font of Christian experiential mysticism, both in the West and the East. Western mystics from MeisterEckhart to Thomas Merton drew deeply from this source.

By the sixth century, the various strands of early desert hesychasm were drawn together in a theological synthesis of its Neo-Platonic and Biblical elements. The Hellenistic influence, coming through Neo-Platonic thinkers such as Evagrius Ponticus, emphasized “mental prayer” and tended toward a Platonic dualism of body and spirit. The Biblical approach, epitomized by St. Macarius, a contemporary of Athanasius, was heart-centered and holistic. [^14]

Hesychastic heart-spirituality was systematized in the sixth century by St. John Climacus of Sinai. Climacus essentially used Neo-Platonic categories to evoke a holistic approach to unceasing prayer. Striking a theme that became crucial in later theological developments, Climacus and his contemporaries _did not pose a contrast between the body and mind or spirit as developed later in the West_. They did not privilege any aspect of the human organism as being closer to the divine vision than any other. Instead, they depicted all elements of the human person as equally “fallen” in the face of God's utter transcendence, and thereby all parts-body, mind, imagination, and soul (compositely represented as “the heart”) — as _equally benefiting_ from the gifts of grace conferred upon the believer practicing hesychia.

Seen from the psychological point of view, hesychasm involves a practice of _stilling the entire being_, both body and mind..[^15] The contemporary Greek mystic and psychologist, Hierothos Vlachos, summarizes the teachings of the Fathers in this respect:

> St. Gregory the Theologian regarded hesychasm as essential for attaining communion with God. “It is necessary to be still in order to have clear converse with God and gradually bring the mind back from its wanderings.” With stillness a man purifies his sense and his heart. So he knows God, and this knowledge of God is his salvation. [^16]

Vlachos quotes John Climacus from his classic work _The Ladder of the Divine Ascent_ on the technique of stillness:

> Stillness of the soul is “Accurate knowledge and management of one's thoughts....Stillness of the soul is a science of thoughts and of an inviolable mind. Brave and determined thinking is a friend of stillness. It keepsconstant vigil at the doors of the heart, and kills or repels the thoughts that come.” [^17]

## “Hesychia” and _The Urantia Book_

If it is true that such practices lead to a consciousness of the presence of God, how would Jesus as depicted in _The Urantia Book_ regard hesychasm?

The UrantiaBook reveals that Jesus used various meditation techniques in his practice of the presence of God. The Greek Alexandrian philosopher Rodan depicts Jesus as a man fully devoted to a “habit” or “technique” that he “so consistently practices...the isolation of worshipful meditation.” (<a id="a174_294"></a>[UB 160:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_10))

Later in the passage, we see that this possibly involves a physical and mental discipline, and it certainly involves a form of stillness:

> I am deeply impressed with the custom of Jesus in going apart by himself to engage in these seasons of solitary survey of the problems of living....and to do all of this with an eye single to the glory of God — to breathe in sincerity your Master's favorite prayer, “Not my will, but yours, be done...”.This worshipful practice of your Master brings that relaxation which renews the mind; that illumination which inspires the soul....The relaxation of worship, or spiritual communion as practiced by the Master, relieves tension, removes conflicts, and mightily augments the total resources of the personality.

Not unlike the hesychasts, we can see in this quote an emphasis on stillness (“relaxation which renews the mind”), breathing (“breathe in sincerity”), and inner attentiveness (“an eye single to the glory of God”).

Remember also that Rodan portrays relaxation or stillness as an essential feature of worshipful communion:

> From the human standpoint it is a question of combined meditation and relaxation. Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines the capacity for spiritual receptivity. (<a id="a184_197"></a>[UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1))

We read elsewhere in the Book that worship is “effortless attention, true and ideal soul rest, a form of restful spiritual exertion.” (<a id="a186_135"></a>[UB 143:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_7))

Thus, there seems to be many elements of teaching in _The Urantia Book_ that provide a bridge to hesychastic spirituality. But much more research is needed in this area. There are important theological similarities between Orthodoxy and _The Urantia Book_; it is not surprising that they teach comparable techniques for practicing the presence of God.

Hesychasm is treated in more depth in my column that appears later in this issue of _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_. As a final point it is important to note that the hesychasts put stress on (1) repentance and (2) observance of the Commandments, as necessary concomitants to the hesychastic practice of stillness.

## The Orthodox Synthesis of Mysticism and Theology

A closer look at Orthodox mystical theology will help underline its dissimilarities with Western theology and what I believe is a corresponding theological _affinity_ with the spirit of _The Urantia Book_.

_The Urantia Book_ frequently emphasizes that theology must be experientially based. It defines theology as “...the study of the actions and reactions of the human spirit...Theology is always the study of your religion; the study of another's religion is psychology.” (<a id="a196_269"></a>[UB 103:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_1))

> The Urantia Book _frequently emphasizes that theology must be experientially based. It defines theology as “...the study of the actions and reactions of the human spirit....Theology is always the study of your religion; the study of another's religion is psychology.” (UB 103:6.1)_

In this same spirit, Patristic theologians from the beginning saw theology's purpose as initiating the believer into an _experience of God_. [^18] Hesychastic mysticism has continued almost unceasingly in the Eastem church, nurturing theological trends in almost every generation. Orthodox theologians from Athanasius to the present have considered as axiomatic the famous dictum of Evagrius Ponticus, who said “If you truly pray, you are a theologian, and if you are a true theologian, you will know how to pray.” [^19]

The first great challenge to this long tradition of the infusion of mysticism and theology arose in the 1+th century. It was issued by a renowned scholar in Constantinople named Balaam, who was influenced by the Renaissance humanism then blossoming in Italy. [^20] The full story of the fascinating disputes that followed is far too intricate to narrate here. What is important for us is that Baalam's provocations aroused the entire monastic community of the Eastern Church, now concentratedat Mt. Athos, in a passionate defense of hesychasm and the mystery of deification.

## The Palamite Synthesis and Modern Secularism

It fell to Gregory Palamas, a brilliant abbot on the “Holy Mount,” to articulate a response from the perspective of the Patristic tradition against the “nominalism” and “apophatism” of Balaam — who by this time had many supporters among the humanistic intelligentsia of Byzantium.

The result of his labors was the ultimate doctrinal synthesis of hesychastic mysticism with Patristic theology. Palamas showed how the most sublime notions of the unknowability of God _in his essence_ (i.e., apophatism), were yet consistent with the doctrine of theosis and the Christ-mysticism of the hesychasts. He distinguished the unknowable essence of God from the knowable “energies” of God as manifested in his revelations to us and as experienced by the hesychastic saints; yet he provided for the paradoxical unity of God's essence and energies.

This is an oversimplifying summary of a great thinker. Suffice it to say that Palamas saved Christianity in the East from what becameits fate in the West: _the sunderingof theology from religious experience_. Corollary to this was the separation of philosophy from theology, and later of science from religion, that is now an earmark of Western thought. The splintering of the Western medieval synthesis began in the Renaissance and was completed in the Enlightenment; in the end it led to the complete secularization of the Western mind in modern times. While we all undoubtediy enjoy the fruits of science and liberal philosophy that resulted from secularism, the world has paid a heavy price indeed from the “death of God” that was its ineritable by-product. Thus, writing some time in the 1930's, the authors of _The Urantia Book_ warned: “Twentieth-century secularism tends to affirm that man coes not need God. But beware! this godless philosophy of human society will lead only to unrest, animosity, unhappiness, war, and world-wide disaster.”(<a id="a210_1051"></a>[UB 195:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_5))

While we all undoubtedly enjoy the fruits of science and liberal philosophy that resulted from secularism, the world has paid a heavy price indeed from the “death of God” that was its inevitable by-product._

If it were not for the Palamite synthesis, and its subsequent adoption in the Council of 1351 , it is very possible that a secularizing humanism might have taken hold in Byzantium among the Hellenistic intelligentsia — just as it had in Europe. This would have eventually marginalized the unique achierements of Patristic tradition. We can speculate that the result over time might have been the substitution of the Othodox mystery of deification with a pagan humanism of self-deification. This of course, is what happened in the succeeding centuries in the West:

> The victory of Palamas was the victory of Christian humanism over the pagan humanism of the Renaissance. The full measure of the controversy's significance can be grasped only in the light of what followed [in the West]. An ineluctable decision was set before the Orthodox Church in the fourteenth century: a choice between a unitary (integral) concept of man based on the Bible, affirming the immediate efficacy of redemptive grace in every sphere of human activity, or the choice of an intellectualized spiritualism claiming independence for the human intellect, or at least autonomy from all matter, and denying that any real deification was possible here below. There is no doubt the secularism of the modernage is the direct consequence of the second choice. [^21]

## Church Governance and Christian Unity

I would like to close by shifting gears and noting the contribution that might be made by the Eastern Church to the reunification of Christianity. _The Urantia Book_ blasts Occidental Christianity for its disunity:

> Christianity is seriously confronted with the doom embodied in one of its own slogans: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” The non-Christian world will hardly capitulate to a sect-divided Christendom... [the] division of Christendom presents a grave weakness....(<a id="a222_276"></a>[UB 195:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_15))

Protestantism now presents the world with thousands of competing “churches” to choose from. One could argue that it has sacrificed unity for the sake of avoiding the problems of diversity.

By contrast, the Orthodox church has retained much of its original doctrinal and organizational unity. Bishops make policy and pronounce doctrine by convening sy nods, just as they did in the early centuries of the church before the rise of the Papacy. The Orthodox church has always been characterized by an atmosphere of deliberation and a search for consensus among the bishops of the _entire church_, along with input from laity and clergy. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is known only as first among equals in a decentralized church order; there is no pope in Eastern Orthodoxy.

This relatively decentralized form of administration provides one model for how to achieve church unity without overmuch uniformity: the Orthodox church's conciliar style of governance is a _middle way_ between Papismand the excesses of Protestant sectarianism. Similar models of “middle way” governance are also exemplified in older Protestant denominations, such as the Anglican and Episcopal.

In the West, Catholic tyranny begat the rebellion of Protestantism against an intolerable ecclesiastical uniformity. Tragically, this in turn shattered the unity of Western Christendom for the foreseeable future. The Eastern church has never generated tyranny or rebellion on such a scale.

Perhaps if the Eastern Church could be induced to see Jesus once again as he lived his life on earth among men — if it could behold the living Jesus as depicted in _The Urantia Book_ — perhaps then it, the historic church of Jesus, the upholder of the sacred truths of the Incarnation and the Trinity, the preserver of integral Christian theologyover two millennia, may be able to assist in leading Christendom toward its eventual reunification as depicted in this crucial passage in _The Urantia Book_:

> The living Jesus is theonly hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true church — the Jesus brotherhood — is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. Uniformity is the earmark of the physical world of mechanistic nature. Spiritual unity is the fruit of faith union with the living Jesus. The visible church should refuse longer to handicap the progress of the invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the kingdom of God. And this brotherhood is destined to become a living organism in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them. (<a id="a234_681"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11))

[^4]: Orthodoxy defines the entire stream of events in the life of the early church-life, death and resurrection of Christ, the creation of liturgical practices and church governance, the adoption of the scriptural canon (settled in 387 at the Third Council of Carthage), and the seven great councils of the Church — as one unified “Holy Tradition” guided by the Holy Spirit.

	It is notable that the Christology proclaimed at Nicaea was revisited in several other Ecumenical Councils in language paralleling that of The UrantiaBook. The Chalcedon Council (451) affirmed Christ as “perfect in Godhead and perfect in humanity,” and “is made known to us in two natures. The difference between the two natures is in no way destroyed because of the union.” Further controversy arose regarding the nature of the humanity of Christ in view of this union. The sixth Ecumenical Council (681) ascribed to Christ “two natural wills.” This doctrine is comparable to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Believers can achieve deification only if a human will or “energy” existed in its fullness in Jesus; this permits Christians to conform to the divine will by uniting themselves sacramentally and mystically to the deified human will of Christ.

Drawing from the holistic image of the Christ physically incarnate, Macarius emphasized the participation of the _whole person_ in prayerthe body, mind, imagination, soul and feelings, all compositely represented as “the heart.”
	Christ came to reestablish the unity of the human composite; and by constantly recalling the name of Jesus the hesychast makes the grace of redemption live within him. That this grace may be truly efficacious, he must make “his spirit retum into his heart,” the center of the psycho-physical organism, and thus reconstitute the original harmony between the parts of the organism.

[^20]: Balaam was born and educated in Italy, and migrated to Constantinople in 1338, gaining renown at the Imperial Court through his brilliantscholarshipin numerous disciplines. Balaam was fleeing the hyper-rationalistic Thomistic environment of medieval Roman Catholicism, and saw himself as embracing instead the profound Hellenism of the East, and thereby returning to the true faith of the Fathers. Against the rationalism of Aquinas, he propounded (at the imperial academy in Constantinople) the “apophatic”(imageless) theology of Pseudo-Dionysius — a crucial strand in the theological synthesis comprising the doctrine of deification. Dionysius taught that God was radically unknowable through any natural human faculties, fully transcendent to all understanding and knowledge.
	But Balaam went even further. By now he had gained such renown that he was appointed by the Emperor to represent the Eastern Church in reunion dialogues with Pope Benedict. He therefore sought a theological basis for overcoming the differences of the contending churches.
	In Dionysius [Balaam] found a metaphysical basis for the reunion of the churches: since God is unknowable, why go on disputing about the procession of the Holy Spirit? The Greeks hold that the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone; the Latins defend their seventh-century addition to the Creed (the _Filioque_) by claiming that he proceeds also from the Son. [Balaam thought] this was sheer presumption on both sides, but especially on that of the Latins. (Meyendorff, p. 88.)
	On one side Balaam attacked the over-confident rationalism of the Thomists; on the other, he assailed the overconfident mysticism of the hesachast theologians, who presumed to base the dogmas of their Trinitarian theology on _experiential mysticism_.
