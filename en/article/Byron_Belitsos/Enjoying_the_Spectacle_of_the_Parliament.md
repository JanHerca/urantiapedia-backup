By Byron Belitsos,

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

The most thrilling moment of the Parliament of World's Religions, the grand convocation of this planet's spiritual traditions held in downtown Chicago last September, came at the close of the 90-minute opening procession. After the last of the representatives of each religious faith was seated, a joyous cheer suddenly arose.

The combined voices of hundreds of religionists from every continent resounded in the Palmer House Hotel ballroom. Cameras flashed and film rolled as the throng of attendees stood and applauded the achievement of uniting these many religions in one place, exactly 100 years after the original Parliament in 1893.

It was exhilarating to witness this momentous occasion as part of a team representing the Fifth Epochal Revelation, knowing that our book will one day provide the conceptual scaffolding for true religious unity.

It was at this event that I first felt free to share my belief in _The Urantia Book_ in a public forum. No need to withhold here; the accepted protocol of interfaith conferences requires that one freely share the heart and soul of one's faith and beliefs — at least such was the way at the great interfaith jubilee in Chicago.

The Fellowship was not listed as a sponsor of the Parliament; neither was a presentation on _The Urantia Book_ to be found among the 500 or so lectures and workshops that were given by virtually every religion, sect or spiritual movement in the world, with the exception of fundamentalists.

It is my hope that we get more deeply involved in the interfaith movement, both for the gratifying experience of sharing deeply with otheropen-minded religionists and to become the salt that adds savor to the global movement for interfaith dialogue.
