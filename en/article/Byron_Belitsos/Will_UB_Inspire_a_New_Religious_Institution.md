_The Urantia Book_ is a profoundly religious document, yet many read it with little or no concern for its possible influence on the church. Many other readers are active in churches and synagogues, and have long speculated on how it may affect their organizations in the future. But consider another possibility: readers of _The Urantia Book_ may one day be inspired to create a _new_ religious institution.

“Every new revelation of truth...” says the _The Urantia Book_ on <a id="a38_66"></a>[UB 87:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_6) “...has given rise to a new cult, and even the restatement of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and appropriate symbolism”. The use of terms like “cult” and “symbolism” come as a surprise to late twentieth century believers. These terms, however, simply refer to an organization of religionists who have created an updated and compelling symbolism that stands for their religious aspirations.

This new institution will grow from the bottom up, for “a religious cult cannot be manufactured.” It is my view that _The Urantia Book_ will inspire a new cultism that is able to meet deep human needs that are essential to spiritual progress, while avoiding the dangers of “institutionalism.”

At the most basic level we are told, the cult “must.... foster sentiment, satisfy emotion, and promote loyalty”; indeed, even “modern men...crave mystery and venerate the unknown.” Beyond these, more advanced needs await satisfaction — both social and spiritual. These needs will also be met by the “enhanced symbolism” of the new cult. This higher symbolism will be “predicated on the concept of the Fatherhood of God and pregnant with the mighty ideal of the brotherhood of man” and must be “based on the biologic, sociologic, and religious significance of the _home_.” <a id="a42_572"></a>[[UB 87:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_8)]

Religious institutions can and have retarded social progress. But the lack of a symbolism adequate for the needs of modern man, the lack of something “to _belong to_”, is a “regrettable” omission from the lives of many progressive modern believers, say the Book's authors.

The fact that no religious organization has yet arisen among the reader/believers in _The Urantia Book_ is puzzling, especially considering that cults grow naturally and unconsciously in religious soil. If I rightly interpret the crucial passages in the “Nature of Cultism” (pp 965-6), cult development is _inevitable_: “...every effective religion unerringly develops a worthy symbolism...”, and _necessary_: “The cult is the skeletal structure around which grows the living and dynamic body of personal spiritual experience-true religion.” <a id="a46_542"></a>[UB 87:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_10)

It would seem that a cult of the revelation, a new religious organization for readers of the _The Urantia Book_, will grow unless specifically thwarted.

## Where Can I Belong

Many of us have discovered _The Urantia Book_, and not finding an inspiring spiritual fellowship, drifted elsewhere to meet this craving, while still adhering to a belief in the primacy of _The Urantia Book_ teachings.

At least this was the case with me. As a young seeker for truth, newly introduced to the Book, I faced this dilemma sometime in 1978. I had just moved to Boulder, Colorado, a town where a solid, devoted study group existed. This progressive town in the foot of the Rockies was also the capitol city of a well-organized, fast-growing Vajrayana Buddhist cult.

The Book and the study group deeply satisfied my intellectual curiosity, but I spent most of my time with the Tibetan Buddhist community, which offered a beautiful, compelling, profound, and _updated_ cult and symbolism, with plenty of intriguing mysteries. The study group provided rational answers to the ultimate philosophical questions, (though Buddhist philosophy was a fair match at times), but the Buddhist “sangha” and its practical religious teachings went much further in meeting my emotional needs.

And the sangha even went on from there. Our _Urantia Book_ passage says that the new cult must, like the olden ones, “...foster sentiment, satisfy emotion, and promote loyalty; _but it must do more_: It must facilitate spiritual progress, enhance cosmic meanings, augment moral values, encourage social development, and stimulate a high type of personal religious living.” <a id="a58_373"></a>[[UB 87:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_7) My emphasis]. The Buddhist cult, at least temporarily, offered all of these qualities to me.

A similar list is given under “Institutional Religion” (<a id="a60_56"></a>[UB 99:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_1)), where the author outlines the purposes of group religious living. These should include “to glorify the potentials of family life,” “to encourage group worship,” “to provide wise counsel,” “to promote religious education,” “to spread...the essential gospel,” and seven other distinct activities.

None of these activities are certain to occur in the typical _The Urantia Book_ study group — except religious education. Study alone cannot meet the criterion of a genuine religious group. _Urantia Book_ study group environments all too often emphasize religious speculation, and some court with the danger of evolving into a “religion of the mind”, a passive and stagnant religion _about_ the Book. On the positive side, study groups can become a preliminary step toward a religious organization or congregation.

What would a genuine religious institution based on _The Urantia Book_ look like? At a minimum, it must apply and exemplify the Book's teachings regarding religious groups. Its characteristics should include at least the following:

1. A congregation that deals with sin and evil by following Jesus' three-step method of maintaining temporal order in the affairs of the kingdom. (<a id="a66_147"></a>[UB 159:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_6))
2. “A form of religious collectivism that confines itself to the furtherance of religious causes.” (<a id="a67_100"></a>[UB 99:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_3)) i.e. a group of religionists that is “separate in function from all other groups”. (<a id="a67_227"></a>[UB 99:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_4))
3. A growing “cult” based on applied love (<a id="a68_43"></a>[UB 87:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_7)) that recognizes the real purposes in the socialization of religion (<a id="a68_154"></a>[UB 99:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_2)).
4. A “living temple of spiritual fellowship”(<a id="a69_45"></a>[UB 157:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_5)) that does not apply creedal pressure (<a id="a69_128"></a>[UB 99:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_7)) on its members.
5. A genuine community that refuses to countenance false forgiveness, but follows instead the truth \& mercy process outlined on <a id="a70_129"></a>[UB 28:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_8) — “justice, fairness, patience, kindness, then mercy....”
6. A dynamic organization that is cognizant of the inherent dangers of religious institutionalism. (<a id="a71_100"></a>[UB 99:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_3))
7. A living community of truth-lovers that is able to achieve profitable levels of religious and philosophic selfcriticism. (<a id="a72_125"></a>[UB 103:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_7))

## First Steps

In my view, the growth of healthy religious organizations based on _The Urantia Book_ is impossible without the first two elements in our list above: (1) the institutionalization of what I would call a _spiritual group process_ and (2) the independence of the religious group from all other groups.

When religionists lack religious due process, there arises the specter of unresolvable conflicts — a condition that can jeopardize even the most straightforward activities. This is why Jesus very explicitly presents a spiritual grievance procedure in the “Sermon on Forgiveness” (<a id="a78_280"></a>[UB 159:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_1)), a passage that closely parallels [Matthew 18](/en/Bible/Matthew/18) in the New Testament.

It amazes me how often we hear quoted the almost mystical passage concerning “when two or three are gathered together...”, and how little we hear quoted the practical and more challenging _first_ part of the same sentence on the same page, in which Jesus refers to our legitimate right to “legislate regarding the conduct of the group.” Here he confers upon the religious group or congregation of believers the right to confront sin and evil according to its own discovery of group wisdom. Obviously, to carry out such a spiritual group process with justice and fairness, the religious group must be _separate_ from all other groups. It must be immune to political pressure or secular concerns; it must stand in brilliant contrast to that secular world; indeed, it must create a “cult of mutual support” (<a id="a80_805"></a>[UB 87:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_3)) for golden rulers who may then be inspired to spread the gospel of Jesus to the whole world.

For those of us looking beyond the contemporary church, and who long for a spiritual fellowship and institutional process based on the high spiritual truths of _The Urantia Book_, a new form of religious organization may be an ideal solution. Call it a new cult, a congregation, a religious collective, or a religious institution, this organization, with its “new and appropriate symbolism”, may be the most important spiritual development of our times!
