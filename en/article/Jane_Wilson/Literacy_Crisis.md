_By Jane Wilson, Brisbane_

“_We have many Christians who cannot read their Bibles, who shy away from study groups for fear of embarrassment, and who do not grow in the Lord as a direct result of their being illiterate._”

_Moody Monthly_

A recent survey says nearly 60% of Americans never read books and most of the others only read one book a year. Books have become commercial property with a short shelf-life, more a source of material for movies and television shows.

Degrees in English literature in the US have decreased by 33% in the past two decades, and English courses in many universities consist mainly of remedial reading.

Another report states the number of Americans who buy, read, or discuss serious contemporary literature is between one and two million.

If the same percentage applies in Australia, that gives us a serious readership of between 60,000 and 130,000 .

A chilling set of statistics also applies to readership of Australian newspapers and magazines, with few new titles being launched.

While the slowdown in consumer spending partly explains the widespread slump, competition, few market gaps, and changing tastes all contribute.

Sixty percent of key magazines are experiencing downturns in sales. Women's magazines continue to defy the trend. Gossip wins over literature.

This is further evidenced in England where the literary magazines, ‘The Listener’ (founded in 1929) and ‘Encounter’ (founded in 1955) have ceased publication due to a change in tradition and lack of readership.

Quite obviously publications around the world will come and go through the 90's.In the many new books and magazines, it is to be hoped spiritual perspectives are addressed. Consumer demand will grow, and when a measurable trend is identified, commercial interests will gleefully claim ownership.

In the meantime, enjoy our solitude. Few out there are reading this.
