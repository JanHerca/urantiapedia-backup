_My Journeys with Jesus—The Urantia Book_ is a five-minute video cleverly arranged by Gary Tonge and a team of writers, artists, and producers. Here is how it is described under the video in YouTube:

A young man, Ganid, reflects upon his time with Jesus when they toured the Mediterranean together with his father, Gonod. The details of this magnificent story of Jesus’ travels can be found in _The Urantia Book_ and also in _The Untold Story of Jesus: A Modern Biography from The Urantia Book (2019)_. Discover Jesus as never before, both as a divine Son and a human hero whose matchless life inspires, comforts, and transforms you.

Enjoy this beautiful video.
