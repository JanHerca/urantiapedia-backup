**From SOUTHERNCROSSINGS, Volume, 1. Number. March 1991**

**A New Age Yogi's Lament**

With my legs all intertwined.
Nirvana fills my mind
As I sit on my bum
Chanting Aum, Aum,

I'm so much calmer
Since I studied Dharna;
Buddha
Woulda
Thought me real cool!

Eyes on the tip of my nose
Damn this lotus pose!
Discipline may be fine
For a spirit thatt's divine
But I've gone numb in the asana!

I visualise the heart
Just for a start,
But it becomes quite lonely
living on virtue only.

Fingering my rosary beads
Arouses carnal needs
And my thoughts drift from mantra
To oh dear ancient tantra!

Qabbalah and crystals transcendental.
The New Age is driving me mental.
I've had lots of fun
Here in padmasana*
But tell me, oh spirits
Cos it gives me the irrits.
How can I try something new tangled
When l can't get my legs untangled?

\* Padmansa is the Sanskrit name for the lotus pose.

**Kirsten McFadden**
