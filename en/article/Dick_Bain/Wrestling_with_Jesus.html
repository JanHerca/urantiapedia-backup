<p>Wrestling with Jesus
Dick Bain, Lilburn, GA.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, we read of Jacob wrestling all night with a man who could be an angel or perhaps God. I have had my own wrestling match; it was with the concept of Jesus.</p>
<p>Before my encounter with The Urantia Book I was content to drift along with no theology except a hazy concept of God. My relationship with this person consisted mainly in giving God a call on the hotline      when I was in hot water or otherwise distressed. But Jesus and I had never been properly introduced. Of course, I had heard the name &quot;Jesus’ as in: “Saved by the blood of Jesus.” or “Do you accept Jesus as your savior?” or heard people sing “What a friend we have in Jesus.” Somehow I didn’t relate to all this Jesus talk and Jesus singing.</p>
<p>Then I met the Jesus of The Urantia Book and it was no longer possible to ignore him. It began to dawn on me that his life and teachings were relevant to my life. Could I then have a relationship with this Jesus as the Christians do? What kind of relationship?  The king and his subject? Back slapping buddies? A teacher and his student? Complicating this is the fact that Jesus is a dual nature being, both human and divine. Neither being seems very accessible. The human Jesus has been dead for over 1900 years, and Christ Michael is perhaps a thousand light years distant. Nevertheless, the Christian claims to have a relationship with this Jesus, so it must be possible. But how?</p>
<p>In order for a mutual relationship to exist, there must be some sort of connection between the persons. Jesus said something about this connection, when he stated that he was present when “two or three are gathered in my name.”</p>
<p>The authors of The Urantia Book inform us that Jesus can be present with us through the Spirit of Truth. They tell us that when we contact the Spirit of Truth, we in essence contact the personality of Jesus or more exactly, the personality of Christ Michael, our Creator Son. (2062)</p>
<p>What does this contact feel like? The Urantia Book specifically tells us that when we encounter spiritual truth, the The Spirit of Truth reacts. From personal experience, I believe this feeling is spiritual satisfaction, perhaps even elation.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book and the Bible refer to The Spirit of Truth as the “Comforter.” Hence, when we are in crisis and feel spiritually comforted it may be the action of the The Spirit of Truth. Further, The Urantia Book indicates that the the Spirit of Truth may offer us guidance, so when we feel we have received guidance, this may also be the action of the The Spirit of Truth. And of course, when we pray, our prayers certainly are known by the The Sprit of Truth.</p>
<p>When we connect with the The Spirit of Truth, are we really contacting Christ Michael, or just a presence that is like him, but not him? Is Christ Michael aware of us as we are aware of him through the Spirit of Truth? Does it matter?</p>
<p>I believe that it is important to know that we are making contact with Christ Michael himself, just as we would rather talk to the person we dialed rather than an answering service person who will relay messages to the person we wish to contact.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine Christ Michael’s consciousness being divided into millions of parts so he can simultaneously and directly contact all the people who desire such contact. Furthermore, the Spirit of Truth does not emanate directly from the Creator Sons; it is circuited through the local Universe Mother Spirit for them. Nevertheless, Christ Michael is a Creator Son, and we can hardly understand the limits of the powers of such a being. Since they are able to transcend time, perhaps they can make contact with more than one individual at a time.</p>
<p>At the very least, it does seem possible for Christ Michael to commune with all those who seek his presence. If we were at a family reunion with 50 people, we could hardly engage all 50 individuals in conversations simultaneously, but we could certainly feel emotionally connected with all those present, and we could certainly go from group to group,      participating for a time in each group.</p>
<p>Regardless of any speculations we might make, or any theories we might devise, we are informed on p.2061 that the Sprit of Truth creates a  consciousness of Michael, not of himself. He also told the Apostles that he would be with them by way of the Spirit of Truth. What is said seems to indicate that somehow Jesus/Christ Michael is literally present in some way via the Sprit of Truth. If so, what do we need to do to insure his presence? What are the impediments to such a relationship?</p>
<p>The lyrics of one of the songs heard frequently on Christian radio stations informs us: “Jesus, Jesus, there’s something about that name.” Many Christians, especially conservative Christians, probably have had a long term relationship with the Christian Jesus.      They feel a great affection or love for this Jesus. Some were taught that he is God and that he gave his life on the cross so we wouldn’t have to spend eternity in Hell. Small wonder that some 	
worship him with such intensity.</p>
<p>There are many Christians who love Jesus simply because of his goodness. For those fortunate enough to have such a relationship prior to reading The Urantia Book, and who are not limited by conservative theology, no doubt the picture of Jesus in the book simply deepens the love and respect these folks already feel for him. But what of someone who knows very little of Jesus or has a negative impression of him because of negative experiences with Christianity? It may be difficult for these folks to move into a positive      relationship with the Jesus of The Urantia Book.</p>
<p>A problem some of us have with the name “Jesus” is all of the Christian baggage that comes with it. I have seen too many Jesus looking down at me in pictures or on plastic crosses with sad, teary eyes. Not that his death was without meaning, but if you do not accept the doctrine of the atonement, the plastic crosses and associated Christian myths about the meaning of his death only serve to distract us from the nobility of his life. I could never accept the idea that Jesus had to die on a cross before God would forgive me. Like the authors of The Urantia Book (see p. 60) I recoil at the idea of atonement.</p>
<p>Many of us find unacceptable the conservative Christian idea that only those who accept Jesus Christ as their savior or redeemer will have eternal life.  Because I have a bit of a problem with the Christian concept of Jesus, I have sometimes used his Jewish name, Yeshua, when I refer to him.</p>
<p>When I say Yeshua ben Joseph, I think of a rugged Gallilean who lived a life of courage and compassion. I think of a man who stopped in the middle of addressing a crowd to go into the street and comfort a woman who was carrying a heavy load. I think of a man who could laugh and enjoy a meal with his friends.  I think of a man who loved the little children. I think of a man who could pull in nets full of fish or plane a plank flat with the best of them. I think of a man who experienced the whole range of human emotions but who wasn’t ruled by his emotions. But in Paper 196, its authors have put it more profoundly than I ever could.</p>
<p>When I think of negative experiences connected with Jesus’ name, I especially think of our Jewish friends. I once worked with a Jewish fellow who grew up in a predominantly Christian neighborhood in New York City. He told me that when he was young, the older Christian boys called him a “Jesus killer” and burned him with cigarettes. Need I say that he had little regard for Christians or for Jesus? Unfortunately, it was the Jesus killer mentality that allowed places like Auschwitz to operate without much protest from the churches or the local population in Germany. Sad but true, the name “Jesus” comes with a lot of negative emotional baggage for some people. And all this raises the question: How will non-Christians react to another book promoting Jesus?</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t ignore that The Urantia Book calls him Jesus, but I believe that as we attempt to introduce the book to non-Christians, we should be aware of their pre-existent ideas about Jesus and be careful to explain the differences between the Jesus of Christianity and the Jesus of The Urantia Book.</p>
<p>I think it is especially important to emphasize that the book does not teach that Jesus is God or the second person of the Trinity. I feel that this is especially important for the Moslem and the Jew for whom monotheism is very strong; and polytheism is strongly condemned. The Christian Trinity smacks of polytheism to such people. By tying Jesus to the Trinity and the atonement doctrine, Christian theologians may have sabotaged Jesus’ appeal to people of the Mid East, as well as to some people of the Occident, such as Unitarian Universalists.</p>
<p>The irony is that sincere religionists who reject the Christian Jesus nevertheless already have a relationship with Jesus/Christ Michael via the Spirit of Truth but don’t know it. The Spirit of Truth operates within our minds whether we acknowledge Jesus or not. Perhaps all that’s lacking is for a two way relationship is acknowledgment that it already exists. It seems to me that the relationship would be enhanced if we know that it is the personality of Jesus that we are contacting. And the relationship would be enhanced if we would reinforce the actions that bring us into contact with the Spirit of Truth.</p>
<p>Probably most of us are already doing those things that would engage us with the Spirit of Truth, such as seeking truth, praying for guidance, and gathering together for spiritual purposes. Obviously, we are not all going to have the same relationship with Jesus, any more than our relationships with each other are uniform. Our cultural background and personal preferences will define and color all our relationships, including that with Jesus. But his mercy and graciousness of spirit make possible a joyful and creative relationship with each of us. But there is one final and difficult impediment to a relationship with Jesus/Christ Michael—ourselves.</p>
<p>All mutually satisfying relationships require several things; one is trust, another is honesty but perhaps the most difficult of all is the willingness to make a commitment. When two people decide to marry, they have to accept certain limitations that they didn’t have before. This perceived loss of freedom has spelled the end for many a relationship because one party or the other lacked the maturity to make the supposed sacrifice.</p>
<p>The freedom to do what we please seems desirable, but the mature person understands that the pleasures of a good relationship far outweigh the illusory freedom of the uncommitted life.</p>
<p>Just so, the spiritual rewards of a relationship with Michael/Jesus far outweigh the freedom of doing our own thing.  And wouldn’t it be comforting to have our elder spiritual brother there to hold our hand when we have to walk through, “the valley of the shadow of death…?”</p>
<p>“The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God.” (1221)</p>
