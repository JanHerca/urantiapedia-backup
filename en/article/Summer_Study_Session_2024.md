Mark your calendars now for Summer Study Session 2024, which will be a conference like no other!

July 24-27, 2024, _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship will be presenting “Igniting the Word: Teaching the Truths of _The Urantia Book_” at Unity Village, just outside Kansas City, Missouri, USA.

Unity Village is an inspiring conference center, with a newly remodeled inn on site, a beautiful auditorium, gracious dining and social areas, high-tech breakout rooms, a nature walk, exquisite gardens, intimate chapels, a labyrinth, and many spaces for reflection, communion, and relationship building. We have caterers lined up to prepare savory food for us. And the evening socials will have a few (very educational, we assure you) fun surprises.

The forty-nine rooms at the Unity Village Inn cost less than \$ 150 per night for a room that can accommodate two to four persons. The campus also has three Airbnbs.

If you prefer to stay off campus, there are several hotels nearby, as well as a couple of campgrounds for those who prefer a more rustic—and affordable—experience.

Arrangements can be easily made for airport pick-up and drop-off, which is about a fortyminute drive.

The Education Committee's Conference Planning Team is working to ensure all participants have a memorable experience. Plenaries will have, as usual, exceptional speakers to inform us about how to spread _Urantia Book_ teachings, whether on an intimate scale or to larger audiences.

Workshops will give us hands—on practice on issues like _elevator speeches_ and what to say when someone asks, Who wrote this book? These workshops will be primarily interactive, as the goal is to allow the best wisdom to surface. We want to hear about your experiences, questions, and wisdom about spreading the good news. Our hope is that we will all learn new and better ways to whet the appetites of others for _The Urantia Book_, as we become more self-confident in our interactions with others. It is a time for sharing both the wisdom of _The Urantia Book_ and our human experiences, to better prepare ourselves for our contribution to the Urantia Revelation's future growth.

Registration will begin in February or early March. We hope to see you at Unity Village in July 2024! Stay tuned for details.
