## How is this chronology compiled?

It is entirely guided by a reading and analysis of The Urantia Book. The book provides extensive chronological data, both exact and approximate, regarding the moments in which the most memorable events of Jesus' life occurred. All chronological data provided in the book has been recorded here. Some dates or moments of specific events have been chosen according to their own criteria. They simply seek to place these events on the calendar and do not claim to be rigorous. In any case, all the events mentioned are taken from the book. The years of Jesus' life are indicated according to the current era, with Jesus' age that year indicated in parentheses. The calendar used is the current one, with 365 days a year and a leap year every 4 years.

Notes: He continues to be tormented by a very strange doubt about who he really is, but he doesn't tell anyone. This year, since he can hardly go to the farm to confide in his beloved uncle, he becomes much more quiet and silent.

## YEAR 6 AD (12 years)

Notes: Jesus returns to his studies when his mother begins to feel better. But he is no longer the same in class. He becomes so quiet and silent that even his teachers are surprised. He devotes himself to his brothers, teaches them everything he could know, and involves them in games and stories. His parents want to talk to him about the angel and their concerns, but they don't dare tell him. His personality distances them from their idea of ​​a king of their nation. Jesus knows all this because he hears them arguing unintentionally at night, but no one seems to understand his strange inner feeling.

## YEAR 7 AD (13 years)

Notes: Many more things would happen that year. First, before going to Jerusalem, Jesus met someone he initially thought was a man, but who turned out to be an angel. The first few days he spoke to him only about unimportant things, but one day he gave him some news. Hence his decision to stay in Jerusalem. Furthermore, in the middle of the Passover feast, he received a messenger from Emmanuel, although Jesus mistook the message. In mid-July, he had another apparition, this time from another angel.

Zealots arrived in the village recruiting people. They had heard about Jesus. Mary supported them, and they tried to convince Jesus, but he refused, reasoning that he shouldn't abandon his family. From then on, they no longer bothered him. In contrast, his beloved uncle Simon, from Migdal, embraced the cause and eventually emerged as the leader of a large group of Zealots, which caused a rift between nephew and uncle. In the village, things with the neighbors began to go badly.

A man named Isaac, a wealthy man and moneylender, appeared in the village, offering Jesus financial security for his family in exchange for joining the Zealots (thus bringing Jesus along with his group of friends from Nazareth). In reality, this was all a ruse by those in the village who were hostile to Jesus. He reasoned with them again and explained his motives. He managed to convince them completely. But not all of them, and this unleashed such a storm in the village that moments of tension were frequent.

3rd, a very sad day. Amos, the youngest brother, dies of a high fever that lasted a week. The family is despondent, and they are lovingly comforted by Jesus. To make matters worse, the household finances are in dire straits. However, Jesus is not discouraged for a single moment.

Notes: Jesus leads the synagogue during the Sabbath reading several times, whenever there is no one to do so in the village. The former school chazzan and friend of Jesus forms a group of young men who meet to discuss philosophical topics. Jesus shares experiences with this group of friends and becomes their leader. Unbeknownst to him, the young Jesus inspires admiration among the young women of the village.

John (the Baptist) refused to accept the priesthood stipend owed to his father; two years later, he had to go to work because they were ruined.

Jesus convinces Mary of his new teaching methods, and they both put this new system into practice at home. Although there were problems with some of the younger brothers, Jesus performed very well in his role as father and brother. Judah, Joseph, and Simon in particular were the ones who caused the most distress to the head of the family.

Rebekah, a maiden daughter of Ezra, a wealthy merchant from Nazareth, was madly in love with Jesus. Unable to resist her desire any longer, she decided to confide in her friend and Jesus' sister, Miriam, and later in his mother, Mary. But she met with only resistance. So in the middle of that month, on Rebekah's 17th birthday, she asked her father to formally invite Jesus to their house. Jesus was greatly surprised. He reasoned with his father, and later with Rebekah, and thus Jesus remained the head of their family. Rebekah, feeling so heartbroken, moved to Sepphoris. However, from then on, a secret love for Jesus would develop, which, although unrequited by him, became the talk of the surrounding towns for a time.

Jesus travels to Bethany for Passover and spends it at Lazarus's house. His friends' mother had died the year before, and young Lazarus was the head of the family. Jesus instituted a new way of celebrating Passover, which was fully accepted by his friends. Upon his return, he attempted to introduce this and other innovations into the house, albeit with little success.

In the middle of the month, Jesus meets with the Alexandrian men and listens to their proposals. They offer him a position as assistant to the chazzan of the main synagogue. Jesus politely declines the offer. Jesus returns to Nazareth and experiences one of the most relaxing moments of his life, in the company of his brothers, who are growing older and older.

Financially, things are going well; for the first time, they don't owe anyone any money. The store has been paid off, and all the brothers are earning a living, including the girls. They've even begun to have a surplus fund.

Jesus begins to feel the disconcerting reality of the power he possessed. (Perhaps he performs several miracles alone?) He begins to understand who he really is. And he begins to understand why he's here and why he came.

During this year, Judah's violent outbursts reached such an extreme, and he was so testing the brothers' patience, that James and Joseph proposed expelling him from the house. If not for Jesus, the family would have experienced some truly tense moments, since Judah even had Mary's approval for belonging to the Zealots. However, for several years, the quarrels between the brothers continued.

Since Jesus had more free time, he spent a lot of time instructing James in the management of the repair shop and Joseph as the head of the family. Mary began to sense that Jesus was about to leave them, and she was in a hurry to talk to her son about the long-forgotten question of "his mission."

Around this time, Jesus took Judah to see his uncle in Sarid, leaving him there to work in the harvest, but he ran away. A week later, Simon found him living as a fisherman on the lake and brought him back home. Jesus then arranged for him to be brought to Simon, his beloved uncle, a fisherman from Migdal, now a Zealot, and Judah willingly remained as a worker under Simon's care.

Double wedding. James and Estha, and Miriam and James were married. The wedding lasted a week, and the financial relief allowed them to enjoy a few moments of joy and true jubilation. At the end, Jesus officially appointed Joseph as head of the family. It was a very emotional moment because it coincided with the emergence of a completely changed Judah, who from then on joined in the domestic discipline by contributing his part.

Notes: The day after the wedding, a very emotional event occurred: Jesus confessed to his brother James that he was preparing to leave home. He gave him ownership of the repair shop, also making him responsible for the care of the house. The conversation between the two culminated in a practical farewell.

19, Jesus leaves the village on a rainy Sunday morning, heading for Tiberias or Tiberias; 20-26 He remains in Tiberias; 21 He heads for Bethsaida, visiting Magdala along the way, and from there spends the night in Nahum where he visits the Zebedee family. From then on, the members of this family develop admiration for Jesus. Zebedee Sr. offers Jesus a job as a boatbuilder, and he accepts. He works for a little over a year and becomes a renowned boatbuilder in Capernum thanks to a revolutionary new system for steaming planks that he devised. During that time, he also occasionally goes out fishing.

During this year, Jesus frequented the company of many people. He was especially interested in the travelers who stopped at the caravan inns and asked about the distant places they came from. He further expanded his dream of traveling. He also officiated numerous times in the new synagogue built by a Roman member of the military garrison.

This is when Jesus gained such fame that he was asked to give a weekly teaching to a group of young people hungry for new ideas. This also spread among the group of day laborers under Zebedee's command, who were the first to begin calling Jesus "rabbi" on his weekly teaching day. Even Judah would come on Saturdays to listen to him in the synagogue and then converse with him.

Notes: During his residence in Capernaum this year, he spent at least five nights a week studying in the synagogue library. One night he would engage in conversation with the elders and another with the young people. A group of people who frequented Jesus' gatherings began to form in the house, and they began to gain a renowned reputation.

Jesus increasingly realized who he really was; during this time, we witness the prodigious and dizzying transformation of the one who would be called from Son of Man to Son of God.

Jesus bids farewell to the Zebedee family and to Capernaum. He asked for a small sum of money to cover his travel expenses and set out for Jerusalem. He promised to remain there until Passover, when everyone would be reunited. He left John Zebedee in charge of sending money to his household weekly. Meanwhile, he settled in with his dear friend from Bethany, Lazarus, whom he had not seen for a long time. During this time in Jerusalem, he also attended the Temple meetings and made sporadic visits to the rabbinical schools. It was Annas himself, the former high priest, who introduced and showed Jesus these schools.

Arrival of the Zebedee Family; Jesus celebrated the Passover meal with the Zebedee Family at the house of Annas, who had graciously invited them. At the end of Passover Week, Jesus met an Indian father and his son, Gonod and Ganid. The father offered him a trip with them, serving as an interpreter. Jesus ultimately accepted. He only told the truth about this period to Zebedee Sr. The others never learned what became of him.

26 They left Jerusalem by way of Joppa and arrived at Caesarea. They embarked for Alexandria on a passenger and cargo ship.

On 17, John's mother, Elizabeth, died. Her family buried her and then informed John. He abandoned his sheep breeding and donated the flock to the En-Gedi brotherhood, in the care of his beloved orphaned child, Ezda. He lived for two and a half years in the En-Gedi community, studying the scriptures, praying, and reflecting.
