The Executive Committee of Urantia Brotherhood:

It has come to the attention of the Board of Trustees of Urantia Foundation that in the course of establishing and fostering the growth of Urantia Brotherhood so that the Urantia Brotherhood might perform its function of disseminating the teachings of the Urantia Book and effectively creating an interested membership through the chartering of Urantia Societies, it would be beneficial for Urantia Brotherhood, Urantia Brotherhood Corporation and the Urantia Societies to make use of the Urantia symbol, comprised of three azure blue concentric circles, in several aspects of the activities of Urantia Brotherhood, Urantia Brotherhood Corporation and the Urantia Societies.

Urantia Foundation mad application for the registration of a trade-mark to protect the Urantia symbol and, accordingly, the trade-mark was approved and registered with the United States Patent Office, with Urantia Foundation named as the registered owner of the mark. Inasmuch as the Board of Trustees of the Foundation does not want the mark to become diluted within the meaning of the law regarding trade-marks through the injurious and indiscriminate use by persons or groups not sufficiently allied to the purposes and objectives of Urantia Foundation, as guided by the teachings of the Urantia Book, the Board of Trustees has duly enacted a resolution which defines the authorization limits and purposes to which the trade-mark can be put by organizations related to the Urantia Foundation.

By circumscribing the use of the Urantia symbol, the Board of Trustees will achieve the objective of legally protecting the use of the trade-mark so that it will be prevented from becoming a part of the public domain subject to exploitation. It is felt that with this protection Urantia Brotherhood, Urantia Brotherhood Corporation and the Urantia Societies can more freely make use of the Urantia symbol in correspondence and publications and on pins and other objects.

A copy of the resolution as adopted by the Board of Trustees is enclosed for your reference.

Yours truly,

(signed)

Emma L. Christensen, Secretary
