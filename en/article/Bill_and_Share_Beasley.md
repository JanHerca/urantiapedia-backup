## Bio

_The Urantia Book_ came into the lives of Bill and Share in 1971. Both were immediately enamored with its truth. They raised their four children using it as their guide. Their hearts burned with a desire to serve this revelation but material responsibilities required their full attention. Through necessity, they became entrepreneurs and as Divine Order prevailed, they found theirselves serving this revelation in far more ways than they ever could have dreamed, for example: Conference Committee members and Speakers for The Fellowship, UAI, and Florida Students of _The Urantia Book_ (FSUB), in addition to participating in Newsletters, Retreats, Worship Services, and Urantia Foundation activities.
