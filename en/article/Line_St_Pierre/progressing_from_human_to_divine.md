We will develop three sub themes, one for each day of the conference. The first is on Family, the second about the Individual, and the third is on Society/Brotherhood.

The Heavenly Father has a mission for each of us. He welcomes us into the great family of God’s children and gives us the opportunity to develop our potentials to carry their full expression of divine values in our material lives and beyond. Indeed, the Father has placed in our hands control over an infinitesimal fraction of the future of the Supreme. We have a good part of eternity to accomplish this mission and it starts now, here, on Urantia.

How do we carry out this major project, this grand and eternal adventure, this beautiful partnership between the human and the divine? By agreeing to become perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. Growth and progress are the watchwords of the universe. By agreeing to grow, to progress from the human to the divine, we will be able to bring into fruition what God has placed in our hands. What are the winning conditions, the tools, and healthy lifestyles that allow for better growth?
