How many of us are saddened to see the world today in such decay? I realize that we all have this need to feel comforted and at peace about what will happen after our time on earth. What will we leave as a spiritual legacy to our grandchildren and their children’s children? It may seem far-fetched to think like this, but it is so little when we know that life is eternal and that this earthly adventure must one day reach the era of light and life.

My greatest wish is that _The Urantia Book_ will find its way into the hands of many souls thirsting for truth and that it will transform the person who studies it.

But how could this happen without a personal commitment from those who have found this treasure? As a fervent student of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings, I feel that these truths are a gift from heaven, an answer to my questions, the object that has given meaning to my life and answers to my many reflections. It has helped me feel better within myself, improving my health and general well-being; it has helped me to strive to be a better person and to be better at living my life and putting my beliefs into action. This book and its teachings cannot remain stagnant—they need to be shared. So, how to share it?

Enthusiasm sometimes has its limits and sharing this treasure with those I love, or with someone I thought was ready to receive a greater truth soon resulted in the opposite, where I felt resistance, then a closure to what I presented. My inability, clumsiness and lack of experience meant that I had not said the right thing, that I had said too much, or that I had gone too far without trying to find out the basis of the need and interest of the person I was talking to. Seeking to give when the person is not ready to receive is like presenting a dish with exquisite flavor to someone who is not hungry.

While seeking to improve my approach to the ministry I am engaged in, and after experiencing the courses of various schools of the Urantia movement, I discovered the **key** that opened a new horizon for me to share my understanding of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ more tactfully and smoothly. There is no magic formula, it is practice and experience that makes us better ambassadors of the revelation.

In February 2020, I completed The Master’s Ministry course at The School of Ambassadors, which is a ministry training school. A school that helps one become a doer; a doer of the second mile and someone who can use the fifth epochal revelation to help set up the necessary environment that can bring about a spiritual rebirth. As of March 2022, the French Ambassador School is located at [https://fr-school.thechristexperiment.org](https://fr-school.thechristexperiment.org/).

I learned to bridge the gap between what the person already believes and what _The Urantia Book_ teaches by building on what already exists and embellishing it with greater depths from the revelation. I have also learned to uplift conversations with people who are not spiritually knowledgeable. Jesus never took anything away from what his listener said, he always added to what was true.

This school is dedicated exclusively to the development of leaders and teachers of the Gospel of Jesus who use _The Urantia Book_ as a reference guide and who do so in a wonderful way. 

The privilege of having found _The Urantia Book_ makes us eternally indebted to our Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth so we must also work to prepare others to carry on the work of Jesus beyond our generation to bring more light to this planet.

I am confident that the Thought Adjuster that lives in every human being will guide the individual in search of greater truth.

> In winning souls for the Master, it is not the first mile of compulsion, duty, or convention that will transform man and his world, but rather the second mile of free service and liberty-loving devotion that betokens the Jesusonian reaching forth to grasp his brother in love and sweep him on under spiritual guidance toward the higher and divine goal of mortal existence. Christianity even now willingly goes the first mile, but mankind languishes and stumbles along in moral darkness because there are so few genuine second-milers — so few professed followers of Jesus who really live and love as he taught his disciples to live and love and serve. <a id="a60_653"></a>[[UB 195:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_5)]
