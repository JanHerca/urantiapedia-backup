_By Line St-Pierre, associate trustee, Urantia Foundation, Ste-Sophie, Québec, Canada_

After becoming an associate trustee of Urantia Foundation, I was invited to join the Education Committee and was asked what ideas I had for potential seminars. I shared with the committee chair, Gard Jameson, that I had been leading in Québec a women's group focussed on the unique value of women. Gard asked me to explore these ideas with some women at the Foundation and to plan a retreat for 2014.

On August 8-10 in Chicago, five women met in friendship, and they shared ideas and explored concepts on the feminine aspect of the divine within us. What specifically has God given to women? What is God's will for women? What does it mean to be a daughter of God?

“Woman...has always been the moral standard-bearer and the spiritual leader of mankind. The hand that rocks the cradle still fraternizes with destiny.” <a id="a42_152"></a>[UB 84:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_4) How can we help mothers become aware of the important influence they have on their children?

We are all encouraged by the revelators to “construct a new and appealing philosophy of living” that integrates truth, beauty, and goodness as we grow more spiritual. Seeds of creativity and originality take root within us as we become “human reflections of the Divine.” We may shine the truth. God is the flame, and we are the torch.

In the amazing adventure throughout eternity, our knowledge of God and our God-consciousness will be progressive, and as we progress, we become increasingly “self-conscious of God-knowing, Godrevealing, God-seeking, and God-finding.” <a id="a46_234"></a>[UB 47:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p6_3)

The women's weekend was filled with joy, with mutual respect, and with appreciation of the sanctity of personality. We concluded our weekend by writing the following mission and vision statement concerning who we are and what direction we want this project to take.

Mission: To enhance the status of being a woman for her spiritual growth, intellectual advancement, and moral progress.

Vision: To touch women's hearts by exploring the dignity of being daughters of God, by honoring their value and importance, and by co-operating with the divine spirit within to bring forth the bountiful fruits of the spirit.
