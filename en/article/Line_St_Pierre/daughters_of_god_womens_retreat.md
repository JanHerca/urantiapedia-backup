September 21 to 24, 2017  
Urantia Foundation, Chicago

As our series of women’s retreats continues at Urantia Foundation, the “Daughters of God” facilitator team is inviting you to an intimate, experiential, and fun weekend.

In their next retreat, “Dancing with God-Emerging in Sacredness,” four Daughters of God have designed a program where they will co-create a milieu of trust within a spiritual circle, to explore together questions such as:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

- What does this statement mean to you: “Jesus never failed to exalt the sacredness of the individual?”
- “Angels never invade the sanctity of the human mind.” How do you relate to this?
- How do you become aware of the sacred in the drudgery of everyday life?

**About Daughters of God**

**Mission:**

_To enhance the status of being a woman dedicated to spiritual growth, intellectual advancement, and moral progress.

**Vision:**

_To touch women’s hearts by exploring the dignity off being Daughters of God by honouring their value and importance, and by cooperating with the divine spirit to bring forth the beautiful harvest of the fruits of the spirit.

If you would like to join this event at 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago, contact Joanne Strobel.
