During her presentation on Zoom on December 11, 2022, Sophie Malicot introduced us to “_The Wisdom of Camille_”, a conference organized by the AUQ. Thanks to the deep and endearing story of this child, candidly illustrated with simple illustrations, we are immersed in Camille's world of reflections.

After the conference and following the participants' comments, Sophie told us that she wanted to make a book so that “_The Wisdom of Camille_” would end up in the hands of more people.

Camille seeks wisdom. Where is it? On this island where she goes according to the advice of her grandmother, who assures her that she will find what she is looking for? Or in the decisions she makes during her return journey? Camille sets off on an adventure, accompanied internally by the one she calls her Shepherd of Light.

“_The wisdom of Camille_” is built progressively, through experiences of which sincerity is the key word. A quest for balance of the living, spiritual and material forces that animate life. This knowledge continues in the decisions to be made concerning the three fundamental points of existence.

This book is aimed at an audience of all ages, from the seeker of truth to the fervent believer. It is an excellent support for reflection and sharing around the essential themes of all human life, addressed in a clear and illustrated manner.
