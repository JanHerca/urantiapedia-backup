_Talk given by Les Sheridan at the 1990 Australian Annual Conference for Readers of The URANTIA Book_.

We do not express our true potential. We use but a fraction of our brain. The brain is in two sections, the right and left hemispheres.

THE RIGHT BRAIN is the realm of genius, intuition, visionaries and seers and it is here that contact with a higher degree of universal knowledge is made. It is receptive, and subjective, recording diligently all communications without analysis or discrimination. It is innocent of guile. This is the realm of intuition, inner tuition. The female aspect.

THE LEFT BRAIN is the realm of logic, reason, intellect and choice, and it is here that contact is made through the senses with the outer material world. It is in the left brain that we plan, formulate and adjust continually to survive in this transient material world of changing values, laws and circumstances. It is objective, aggressive and insistent. The male aspect.

One cannot plan and build with certainty on this sand of constantly changing values, theories and political assurances. For example, Dr. Lardner (1793-1889) Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy at University College London said ...“Rail travel at high speed is not possible, passengers being unable to breathe, would die.” He also said ...“No large steamship would ever cross the Atlantic because it would require more coal than it could carry.” The 'Great Western' crossed two years later. Ernest Mach (1838-1916) Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna, said ... “I can accept the theory of relativity as little as I can accept the existence of atoms and other such dogmas.” Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) after he had split the atom for the first time said ... “the energy produced by the breaking down of the atom is a poor kind of a thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine” etc. etc.

Joining the right and left brain are bridges of nerve matter — the medulla (lower) and the corpus callosum (upper). Thought patterns pass over these bridges ... I believe the outer material left brain thoughts use the lower bridge, whilst the higher universal right brain thoughts pass over the upper bridge.

In this material age, the left brain using the lower bridge is more active with local material issues than the right brain using the upper bridge to passover higher universal issues. There is imbalance, and it manifests in disharmony, discord, distress and disease at personal, communal and national levels. How often when labouring the mind with plans, arbitrary agreements, reports and theories, have you massaged the base of your skull, the area of this lower bridge, the base or lower bridge for base or lower thought patterns, and similarly, having exhausted your logic and the advice of men, lowered your head into your hand, the hand on top, in despair.

You are intuitively being shown the way through your problem. For don't the ancient writings say ... “I am your God. I will instruct you in the way that you will go.”

The truth of an individual life is within, wanting to get out. It is not outside trying to get in. The oak is within the acorn, and so it is with all forms of life.

The way of course, is to listen to your right female mind, to receive this altogether wonderful truth of your life. Look into it, hear it, acknowledge it as worthy of your total dedication and commitment, and act on it, obeying it to the letter. Do this in every ongoing situation. Put it into effect by using your God-given skills and talents to express it in the material world. You will then be building on a sure rock foundation. You will be manifesting or creating true.

So, we have the female aspect receiving the higher ideals of your life from the high or grand mind, the universal mind, and wanting to present, to passover this precious truth to the practical, objective male aspect for it to be established in the material world. Here is the voice of intuition, the inner tutor, the still small voice of the supreme Architect and Teacher. The voice of intuition flies in the face of logic (steam trains, steam ships, nuclear energy are fact despite the logic of Lardner, Mach and Rutherford).

The authority for what I am saying is ... God said, “let us create man in our image ... male and female created he them and called their names Adam and Eve (mortal)”.

The right and left brain in balance, is entrance to higher degrees of knowledge.

Leave, with these thoughts and assurances ... the area of the corpus callosum is the fontanelle, which means font or fountain. Fountain of higher life, higher knowledge. The fairy or star at the top of the Christmas tree. The seat or throne of spirituality in a mortal. The kingdom of life is within.

I stand at the door and knock (it is an inner door).

The wisdom of God is foolish in the eyes of man, the wisdom of man is foolish in the eyes of God.

Don't concern yourself with the things of the world. Seek first the kingdom of life within and all things will be added to you. Don't you know you are a temple of the Holy Spirit of Life?

The Spirit is a two-edged sword, rightly dividing material from spirit. Don't build on sand. Call upon me in your day of trouble and I will deliver you. Ask, seek, knock, where? The right mind. The chalice, the cup or container of your truth of life. Truth, life, passover corpus, the way words are used in this address. Do they resonate in your mind as they do in mine?

**Les Sheridan, Warburton, Victoria**
