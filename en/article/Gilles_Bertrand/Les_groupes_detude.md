At the request of the President of the AUQ, it is proposed to us as students, participating in a study group of the _Urantia Book_, to submit some ideas on the advantages of meeting regularly in this form of communication as such. Notwithstanding this consideration which suggests this form of meeting in the opinion of our planetary supervisors, we can therefore show our capacities to recognize the merits of this request.

There is no need to be an expert in writing or literature to express your opinion or vision on these current meetings. The main purpose of these writings is simply to show the benefits of reading, study and fraternal sharing among us in our regular meetings of the study groups of the _Urantia Book_.

As an example, simply give your assessment rephrased as follows:

What does my study group bring me personally? What help or benefit does it bring me? Is it important to contribute my personal comments and remarks? Etc.

By writing a short article of a few lines, dear readers, which will probably be distributed by our monthly Réflectivité which will group these observations together, not only will this have the effect of stimulating our friends eager for knowledge in all directions, but it will certainly have a remarkable repercussion in your own conscience.

These notes, relatively brief on your part, will advantageously contribute in a thousand and one ways to the understanding of our attitude towards life and will at the same time promote the usefulness of the study groups of the _Urantia Book_.

So, take up your pens, dear friends, for short extracts of your particular appreciations and critiques (only one sentence if you want...) and I will then collect the fruits of your annotations to perhaps edify your contemporaries.

United in the Supreme!

Gilles Bertrand
