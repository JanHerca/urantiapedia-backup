Quebec

The Urantia Association of Quebec began its fall activities on the Zoom platform at the end of summer. With this conference of capital importance entitled Divine Paternity/Mansion Worlds, it was right to retain the services of our good friend Conrad Lavallée.

This conference whose central subject deals with the personality of God followed by our common relational experiences make them both capital themes which respond, as the presenter says, to the existential questions of life. Such was therefore this title judiciously chosen and presented on this Sunday of September 17, 2023.

Around thirty people attended this meeting which was interactive and the time allocated for this talk was exceeded, certainly leaving the participants wanting more.

Conrad suggested that I include a document that supports his presentation and place it somewhere available so that it can be consulted. But stubbornly, I am writing this text precisely to encourage you to instead view directly the recordings provided by the A.U.Q. which, for me, could reveal even more the full potential of the power of the art that the presenter has provided us.

The latter served us with magnificent examples of comparisons in an unusual form and language and even with the enormity of this task, which is to demystify The Universal Father, you led us Conrad to the door of the personality of our heavenly Father as you say and you succeeded in showing the grandeur and the incomparable love of the most important personality of the Universe, a majestic, perfect and infinite personality.

For my part, I was enlightened and particularly touched when I understood that the greatest force in the universe could have an intimate, friendly and particularly unique relationship with me... I still tremble, because the word unique had always escaped me and now I am even closer to God, my Creator, and I dare say perhaps now my friend!

In the second part, you spoke to us about the morontia worlds. I thought that after my visit a short time ago to the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, the beautiful landscapes and panoramas of beauty that I saw would be exceptional adventures, but once again you surprised us with your effective sense of demonstration even if everyone had already read these visionary passages described in ***The Urantia Book***.

Without encouraging us to want to leave our world, in any case I hope so, you took us on a magnificent journey through the morontia worlds and I still have in my head these splendid descriptions which make me dream.

Better still, I leave you with other treasures to discover, you dear readers, so you can grab magnificent useful and practical concepts right now.

Here are, among others, two gems that I truly appreciated. The symbolism of the glass half full or half empty which leads us to maintain a fair view of our future and that of electromagnetism which visually demonstrates our true attachment to supreme values.

Go refresh your soul in these rivers of hope and wonder by peacefully listening to this video and you will tell me about it again!
