_By Richard Doré and Colette Pelletier, Québec, Canada_

For many years a small group of dedicated readers of $L e$ Livre d'Urantia has relentlessly worked to render the French translation of _The Urantia Book_ into audio format. This project was sponsored by the Quebec Office of Urantia Foundation. The persons who read the text were chosen for the quality of their diction of the French language.

This high-quality French audio version is now available and is packaged in a case containing 2 DVDs in MP3 format with a booklet presenting the Table of Contents and running time. People can purchase the French audio version in any book shop in Quebec and also from the website of one of Quebec's largest bookstore chains, Renaud-Bray, www.renaud-bray.com (search for Urantia).

Le Livre d'Urantia in audio format offers many advantages for the French-speaking readership. Persons with sight handicaps may now discover the supernal teachings revealed in _The Urantia Book_. In addition, interested persons who lack the time or reading skills will be able to listen to the teachings while engaging in low-concentrating activities, such as walking, jogging, exercising, and traveling.

The Quebecois responsible for the audio version of the French translation deserve kudos for their perseverance, loving service, and unselfish devotion concerning this remarkable contribution to the French-speaking readership.
