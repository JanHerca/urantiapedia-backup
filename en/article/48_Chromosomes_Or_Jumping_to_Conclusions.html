<p>Cosmic Reflections
48 Chromosomes? Or Jumping to Conclusions</p>
<p>&quot;There were, originally, twelve distinct and divine concepts of transmissible life. This number twelve, with its subdivisions and multiples, runs throughout all basic life patterns of all seven superuniverses. There are also seven architectural types of life design, fundamental arrangements of the reproducing configurations of living matter. The Orvonton life patterns are configured as twelve inheritance carriers. The differing orders of will creatures are configured as 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, and 768. On Urantia there are forty-eight units of pattern control—trait determiners—in the sex cells of human reproduction. (397)</p>
<p>&quot;On Urantia there were twenty-four such custodian commissioners, two for each fundamental or parent pattern of the architectural organization of the life material. On planets such as yours the highest form of life is reproduced by a life-carrying bundle which possesses twenty-four pattern units. (398)</p>
<p>“These life circuits caused the chromosomes of the specialized Urantia pattern to reorganize…” (857)</p>
<p>There are several ways by which these statements from the book may be misinterpreted. That there are 48 units of pattern control in the sex cells could mean that each of the two types of sex cell (egg and sperm) has 48 units, or it could mean that together the two types have 48 units. The statement that the highest form of life on Urantia is reproduced by a life-carrying bundle possessing 24 pattern units favors the interpretation that the 48 units are distributed as 24 units in each of the two types of sex cell. But perhaps we humans are not that form of life! A further possibility is that the 48 units could be taken to mean 48 chromosomes.</p>
<p>The mention of chromosomes on p. 857 shows that the revelators were familiar with the term and may indicate that trait determiners or units of pattern control are not necessarily synonymous with chromosomes. We should also note that equating “trait determiners,” “units of pattern control,” and “inheritance carriers”  with one another may not be a valid assumption.</p>
<p>It was not until 1954  that it was realized that the human chromosome number, until then thought to be 48, was in actuality 46. It is 48 in our cousins, the monkeys and the apes, but due to the fusion of two of our chromosomes, we now only have 46. Some readers have been concerned that the revelators made an error.</p>
<p>It is now known that only about 5% of the DNA in our chromosomes actually codes for the one to two hundred thousand genes that make us a functional being. Our DNA is comprised of about three thousand million DNA letters and the average gene uses the information coded in only a few thousand bases.</p>
<p>We can get an idea of what might be reality by making some approximations. Let’s assume that the 12 fundamental “inheritance carriers” are not chromosomes but units of pattern control critical for morphogenetic development. Let’s also assume that each unit consists, on average, of twenty genes bundled together as an entity.</p>
<p>Together then, the 12 units of pattern control account for 12 x 20 = 240 genes. Hence the Urantia mortal’s 48 units of pattern control would require 960 genes—a little less than 0.5 to 1 percent of our gene complement of 1 to 2 hundred thousand genes. The extreme value of 768 units of pattern control would then require about  7.5 to 15 percent of the gene complement.</p>
<p>Why would any creature require 64 replications of the basic 12 units of pattern control? One reason might be that there is a marked increase in the rate of copying mistakes under the extreme conditions experienced on some planets and a large number of copies of the control units is required to ensure survival of the individual (note: there is some evidence that polyploid plants have a degree of hardiness not present in their diploid ancestry).</p>
<p>Perhaps also we are missing something that has deep significance in the apparent coincidence of “seven architectural types of life design” and the seven doublings in the sequence 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768?</p>
<p>There appears to be no essential reason to equate a unit of pattern control with a chromosome and certainly no good reason to distribute the units on the basis of one per chromosome. The only requirement appears to be that these units behave as pairs in much the same manner as do pairs of genes during cell division. Hence the confusion caused by equating the 48 units of pattern control with the erroneous chromosome number of 48 may be a simple case of “jumping to conclusions.”</p>

<p>Alternatively…</p>
<p>There is an alternative and quite different interpretation of the 48 chromosome polemic. In this instance, we simply accept that the authors followed their mandate to the letter. Hence, though they would have been aware that two of our chromosomes had fused to bring the number to 46, they conformed to the rule that they were not permitted to give us unearned knowledge (except in special circumstances), and so they remained with the then current count of 48.</p>
<p>In her article entitled “Intolerance” in the previous issue of Innerface, Ann Bendall commented, “When it comes to intolerance for another group’s religious beliefs, it is interesting that The Urantia Book affirms, ‘Only with revealed religion did autocratic and intolerant theologic egotism appear.’” (1012)</p>
<p>Surely the revelators were inferring that autocratic and intolerant theologic egotism would inevitably make an appearance among the readership of The Urantia Book.</p>
<p>This kind of tendency certainly comes to the fore with biblical fundamentalists who take the Old Testament as the divine and infallible word of God, then manipulate some of its verses to permit them to declare that the creationary act bringing our world into being was somewhere about 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Questioned about this, these biblical fundamentalists will declare that hard physical evidence such as the correspondence of sedimentary rock deposits (and the fossils they contain) between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa has no significance.
The revelators must have known that similar things could happen with the interpretation of materials contained in The Urantia Book.  One possible way to avoid fundamentalism dominating the future course of events with the book was simply to sometimes take the mandate literally, and use the human source materials exactly as they were written.</p>
<p>That we must reflect deeply on how we think about The Urantia Book is indicated by: “Revelation is evolutionary but always progressive…If revelation is to exalt and upstep the religions of evolution…(it) must portray teachings not too far removed from the thoughts and reactions of the age in which they are presented…Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man’s capacity of receptivity.” (1107)</p>
<p>We must also beware of possible changes to the meaning of words during the evolution of language. For example, the word “cosmology” is used in the book in a quite different way from its current usage, and in a way that drastically changes the meaning of many statements in which it occurs.</p>
<p>Traditionally, “cosmogony” is an account of the creation of the universe, and “cosmology” is the unfolding story of the universe. Since the advent of Einstein’s relativity theory, “cosmology” is used, almost exclusively, to describe the endeavors of physicists to understand the large scale space-time structure of the universe on the basis of that theory.1</p>
<p>The revelators use this term “cosmology” in its earlier and much broader sense, including in it the story—past, present, and future—of  our universe’s evolution, and details and history concerning both its celestial and terrestrial inhabitants.</p>
<p>The mandate warns us that “any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a short time” and “the cosmology of these revelations is not inspired.”</p>
<p>If  we take “not inspired” to mean “without dogmatic celestial authority” and “cosmology” in its earlier sense, at least one third of Parts 1-3 of the book may be in the “not inspired” category. Part 4 may be wholly so.</p>
<p>The authors leave it to the reader to sort out what, for them, is “inspired” from mere “cosmology” which is not.</p>
<p>This is really not so difficult once we rid our minds of our fundamentalist-type of preconceived notions. And if we err, the fault is ours, not the revelators. They have given us specific warning. (1109)</p>
