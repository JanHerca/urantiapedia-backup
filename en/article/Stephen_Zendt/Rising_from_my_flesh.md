What is this soul
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which shall arise
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes, rise up
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when I have laid me down?

Where shall my life be borne 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when all heartbeating
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time has stopped
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and breath is gone?

The stars have beckoned me 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since my childhood days, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the cloaking dark pierced 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by pinpoint light and silver.

Arising from my own familiar flesh 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would put off mortality 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to garb this most personal one 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am in infinite awakenings of love.

Yet now my fledgling self seems ready 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to dissolve when I assume a 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vast infinity as universal goal 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and destination of my soul.

These old and mouldy fears are mine to lay 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; away for wisdom says I shall 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; break forever free discovering 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a universe of possibilities.

For one companion, wisdom's friend and welcome, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ever onward enthuses me in 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; preparation for this long-sought 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; voyage beyond my mortal frame.

My Father, friend, your steady presence 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has become my golden guide 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and rule and all the stars and time are but 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the firstfelt evidence of your eternal home.
