Jesus began to use parables with this declaration (<a id="a36_51"></a>[UB 151:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p1_1)) and proceeded to tell the multitude the story of the sower of the seed. Later, the apostle Matthew asked him: “_Why do you speak in parables to those who seek the truth?” Jesus is instructive in his reply to them, saying, in part, “ .. . those who really desire to enter the kingdom may discern the meaning of the teaching and thus find salvation, while those who listen only to ensnare us may be the more confounded in that they will see without seeing and will hear without hearing._” (<a id="a36_584"></a>[UB 151:1.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p1_3)) I am fascinated with this storytelling which the Master uses so perceptively. It is my belief that the parables of Jesus are expressions of his genius and are genuine pieces of art. For many years, I treasured the story of the Prodigal Son, for it spoke to me deeply at a time when I felt like a prodigal. Ask many people, and they will remember the parables more than any other feature of Jesus' teaching.

Why are these parables so memorable? What is it that has carried them through two millennia as valuable treasures of spiritual teaching? How might we go about distilling our new universe perspective, our transforming religious insight, into just such memorable morsels?

> Light upon light, God guides whom He will to His light. God sets forth parables for men, and God has knowledge of all things. The Qur'an 24:35

Some of us who were raised in the vacation bible school tradition may well remember an old song we were taught that began: “Tell me the stories of Jesus, I love to hear.” People who hunger for truth and righteousness want to hear stories, tales to confirm their faith, strengthen their resolve to become a better person, and vitalize their hope of everlasting life. I am convinced that we have a task before us, as believers in the gospel, to formulate our contemporary experience into tales that will uplift other sincere seekers. I am equally persuaded that the most artful form these expressions might take is a parable. But this is not an easy task.

The condensation of symbol, plot and character into the jewel-like form of a parable, along the lines of Jesus' wondrous stories, will require all the talents we have to give.

After all, how do we symbolize our transformation? What “one great truth” will be our basic principle as the story unfolds? Which of the multifarious symbols now available to our discernment will carry our meaning to the eager listener?

Perhaps a careful reading of pages 1582 and 1583 in _The Urantia Book_ will give us an idea of Jesus' intentions. Our task, should we be moved to attempt the creation of a parable, will be to allow the meaning to reside in the listener or reader. On <a id="a48_250"></a>[UB 171:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8_8) Jesus says: “_Ponder well these words in your hearts, while each of you finds out their true meaning_.” And again, he says on <a id="a48_420"></a>[UB 167:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_4), “_Let every man find out the meaning for himself and in his own soul_.”

The parable does its best work when, like the leaven in the measure of meal, it is allowed to permeate the entire personal life, and it is able to do so because it is concise, complete, and in a way, concentric. The mind is able to memorize the contents of a parable, even a mind cluttered with the demands of our tumultuous urban lifestyles. I like to think that it goes to the heart of the matter. It enlightens the mind, the soul, and the personality in three rings of influence that tend toward transformation.

The Prodigal Son meant so much to me because it assured me that I would be welcomed back and enjoined in celebration. It generated hope for me when I needed it most. The woman who finds her lost coin, the shepherd who finds the lost sheep, the merchant marveling over the pearl of great price, speak eloquent phrases to our inner life. But what about the future? Can there be some refreshment of our expressions of faith? How might we formulate meanings for a planetary culture, a worldwide fellowship of believers?

As you ponder this, I would challenge you to use your journal, or your scribble-book, or your jot pad, and in your moments of meditative contemplation, put down on paper some of the images and ideas that rise to consciousness. No one will have a perfect piece at the start. Yet, if we approach the task sincerely, willingly allowing the Father's will to be our guide, who can say what might be the result? Let us give it a try and strive for a good result. When you feel you have something true and beautiful and good, share it with loved ones and fellow believers.

Let their reactions guide you as you tone and perfect it. Shape your work as a sculptor or a composer might do. Recall that clarity, concise structure, and depth of meaning are goals.

When we have begun to mature as kingdom believers, we may have the thrill of having one of our parables chosen to be spread around the world, as our movement increases in numbers, and our opportunities for expression grow.

As you practice honing your writing skills, keep Jesus' admonition in mind:

> . . . You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me. (<a id="a62_431"></a>[UB 176:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_5))
