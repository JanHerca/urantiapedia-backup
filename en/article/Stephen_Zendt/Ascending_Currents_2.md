## A MEMO

FROM: The thick of the fray
Bogged down by crippled companions
In hope, faith, and in dedication
At the edge of the transition.

TO: The Promise of my eternal destiny
In infinite and abiding love.

Thank you, Father,

I hereby empty my misconceived and 
erring perceptions into the void of 
unreality from whence they came. I return 
my heart to your care and fulfillment... 
making sure that this empty cup will be 
filled by you and your gifts only...

We stumble in impatience, letting go, 
for a moment, of the secure hand of 
faith — only to find ourselves lost in 
darkness, exhausted by confusion, and 
frustrated by negativity.

Fill my mind with your truth 
Fill my heart with your love 
Guide my hands in your work 
And my tongue in your words

Peace be unto all mankind.

## A PRAYER FROM AN ANGEL

Version by Larry R. Geis,
San Francisco, California

Remember, my child, do not be afraid. 
I am your shepherd, your caretaker. 
You shall not stray nor be in want. 
Always am I by your side, leading you 
In beautiful paths of life everlasting. 
You shall not want for food nor thirst 
for water.
Though you go down into the valley of 
doubt;
Though you ascend into worlds of 
confusion;
Though you move in loneliness or in the 
company of friends;
Though you exult in triumph or falter in 
solitary despair;
My great spirit of love shall enfold you, 
And my glorious angels will comfort you. 
Even though you descend into darkness 
And death itself, do not doubt me or 
fear me,
For this I promise you above all else:
One day, in the fulness of time, you 
shall rise up
To sit with me in eternal safety and 
peace.

## A PRAYER

Father, Michael, Brother Jesus, 
Teach us the lastingness of loyalty 
The steadfastiness of courage 
The longsuffering watchcare of love, 
And the desirable peacefulness of faith.

As we discover the community of our 
Father's friends,
Lead us to open our hearts to new 
personalities and to
new possibilities, that we may ever be 
as yeasted bread
And hosts to growth and evolution. 
Grant us your peace.

— Stephen Zendt

SHINE THROUGH ME, DEAR FATHER, 
PUREST RADIANCE TO ENLIGHTEN 
MY SMALL WORLD.

— Matthew Klein
