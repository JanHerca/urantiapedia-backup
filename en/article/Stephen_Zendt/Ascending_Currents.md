**My Fellow Creatures**

<p style="text-align: center;">
There is a pitee on the outer fringes of this finite<br>
Where my love and I embraced in an eternal light.<br>
<br>
Twas there in distant time, to mortal reason<br>
The supreme gave a glimpse of what is to be.<br>
<br>
Bathed in light, we were coddled in a peaceful tone <br>
and welcomed by many beings.<br>
<br>
Until as a snowflake falling to mother earth,<br>
I awakened to a new day, and behold...<br>
<br>
Blending in Divine light<br>
Those locked in this finite.<br>
<br>
My fellow creatures.<br>

Father, thank you for this day.
Hear us as we pause to pray.
We thank you for our home and food.
Help us to create Brotherhood.

## A Urantian Group Prayer Of Thanksgiving, Ad 1987

_Heavenly Father, Holy Mother..._
_Beloved Chist Michael, Beloed Creative Daughter Spirit,_

_We humbly ofer you great praises of thanksgiving_
_for being our perfectly loving Divine Parents._

We sincerely offer an expression of gratitude to our Paradise Parents of Trinity:

Thank you, Universal Father, for yout gifts of unique personality the indwelling of our minds by your perfect Thought Adjusters. We are in awe that as the least of all your children, we host the highest spirit entity in all creation.

Thank you Eternal Son, for the bestowal of your Paradise Son, Michael of Nebadon, Master Sovereign Creator Son of our universe, who came to our planet as Christ Jesus. Glory to you, Great Spiritual Lure, for ever attracting us homeward.

Thank you, Infinite Spirit, for our mindal connection to reality, and for your supernal seraphim who guard us as infants and later deliver us from death. You keep us sane on a world that kills God's messengers.

_We are your loyal agodonters of Urantia, dear Lord. We are your peerless creatures who can believe without seeing, who can overcome insuperable obstacles, and who can persevere even when isolated. We commit ourselves and our offspring to the dedication of attempting to do your divine will, rather than our own._

Thank you, Master Michael, for bestowing yourself as a mortal of the realm. For choosing our world of the cross as the only one in eternity for your human incarnation, we offer you undying gratitude.

We are thankful for our planet's Midwayers who have brought to us the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

_Dear God, we appreciate the incredible privilege of being of service to your spiritual family on a quarantined sphere where your love is so desperately needed._

Thnak you, incomprable Jesus, for your merciful ministry to us through your Spirit of Truth. You indwell us also.

Thank you, Father, for our human brothers and sisters: our parents, our children, and all other relatives in our five-billion-member family.

**We extend thanksgiving to our adorable Father-Mother God who is ever our friend, always forgiving, perfectly patient, and in whom we move, live and have our being. always will it be so. Amen.**
