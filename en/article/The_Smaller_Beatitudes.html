<p>The Smaller Beatitudes
[Adapted from the Catechist Newsletter, Dutton Park, Qld.,  January 1998]</p>
<p>Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves; they will have no end of fun.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who can tell a mountain from a molehill; they will be saved a lot of bother.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who know how to relax without seeking excuses; wisdom has surely overtaken them.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who know when they should listen; they will learn new things.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who take not themselves seriously; they will be valued by others.</p>
<p>Happy are they who take small things seriously and serious things calmly; they will go far in life.</p>
<p>Happy are they who smile copiously and frown not; theirs will be the sunny side of life.</p>
<p>Happy are they who are rich in understanding; they may be taken for fools, but that is the price of charity.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who think before acting and pray before thinking; they will avoid much blundering.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who can curb their tongues while presenting a smile; the Gospel has penetrated their hearts.</p>
<p>Happy are you when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, yet you still recognize the God-Spirit in all whom you meet; for the light of truth shines forth in your life and you have found true wisdom.</p>
