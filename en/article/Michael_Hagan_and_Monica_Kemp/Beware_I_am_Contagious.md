I confess.

I may be a super-spreader.

Come in contact me at your own risk.

Recently, I have been conspiring with an accomplice to spread a new virus into the world. Actually, it is a new variant of an ancient virus. Those who catch it will experience the following symptoms:

- A growing sense of humility, not selfabasement but an unusual tendency to see oneself as a small part of something larger than life

- An emerging suspicion that accumulating possessions is not the most important thing in life - A loss of interest in being seen as the most important person in their immediate surroundings

- A tendency to talk to unseen beings

- Becoming generous in all ways, both materially and in relationships

For most, this virus will last only a few days, a brief interruption followed by resumption of a comfortable, self-centered life. For some, it will suggest long term change, perhaps even “intensive care,” as they think deeply about their lives and ponder new spiritual directions. A few will become longhaulers, their lives transformed by this virus.

The luckiest and the hardiest will themselves become super-spreaders. They will not rest until they have done everything possible to spread this _benign virus_ of love to the corners of their experience, maybe to the corners of the earth.

Take note-there is no known vaccine, and no pill designed to foster any level of immunity. At some time in your life, if not already, you will encounter it. When you do, look deep inside. Allow God's spirit that lives within you to guide your reaction.
