_By Gerardo Leche, Guatemala_

In the early 1990s, _The Urantia Book_ arrived in Guatemala, and Luis Martinez and Gonzalo Caceros began introducing it to prospective readers. They also started a study group.

Mark Bloomfield, from the UK, came to Guatemala and traveled throughout Guatemala, placing the book in libraries.

Recently, readers participated in two book fairs, support for which was rendered by Tamara Strumfeld of Urantia Foundation and Buck Weimer and Agustin Arellano of the Urantia Book Fellowship. They were most helpful with the book fair, and we are grateful indeed for their assistance.

Today many Guatemalans are interested in _The Urantia Book_. Little by little the book is speaking for itself. And we observe that Guatemalans in a certain segment of society are ready to receive the great teachings of the Urantia Revelation.

In the future, the book may be well known and widely accepted, but time must pass. In the meantime, we shall “possess our souls in patience,” knowing that “over-rapid growth would be suicidal,” and that “the book is being given to those who are ready for it long before the day of its worldwide mission.”

Peace be with you.
