First a heartfelt thank you to Derek Samaras, who just stepped down as Chair of the Committee!

We very much appreciate your service, a good handoff, and your quiet service still behind the scenes.

The International Fellowship Committee has some exciting events occurring the next six months:

Two events are in November are the Guadalajara Book Fair. Agustin Arellano is spearheading that opportunity to help bring El Libro de Urantia into the consciousness of Mexican booklovers.

Past book fairs have had success and have been well organized with a dynamic booth display that is inviting and designed to intrigue.

Also, our first conference where we hope to attract thirty to forty interested Filipino students of _The Urantia Book_, is our first conference in Manila, November 22nd to 24th. Eugene and Belen Asidao have been instrumental in getting this organized.

In April 2020, a Spanish-language conference is being organized in Monterrey in northern Mexico.

We are looking at potential events developing in Uganda and, perhaps, Nigeria in 2020. We have a dynamic IFC with Barb Maier, Joy Brandt, Dolores Nice, Flor Robles, and Jack Holloway as members; adjuncts Charlene Morrow, Buck Weimer, Arlene Weimer, Agustin Arellano, Pablo Segovia; and Worldwide Service Chair, Brent St. Denis participating in the Committee.

We value their direction and wisdom for best service to our world outside the borders of the United States; Urantia, a world that needs this revelation in every corner.

I'm grateful to be serving with such a remarkable and dedicated team.

I look forward to seeing where next the revelation may take root!
