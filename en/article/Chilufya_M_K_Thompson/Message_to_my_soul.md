The object of love is Jesus for He hails from the Father.

The object of love is God the Father from whom all reality transcends now and forever.

The object is Jesus for He is your Lord and Master.

The object of love is Jesus for He is the true light that lights every Spirit-born soul.

The object of love is Jesus for He is the living truth, the living water that will quench every thirsty soul.

The object of love is Jesus for He is truth, beauty, and goodness.

Now then, let us worship Him for His goodness, crave to enter into His light and be blended therein to magnify this unextinguishable flame.

Exhort Him on high, praise Him and above all, love Him.

He will come again to His mortal home, Urantia (Earth) which gave Him the final glory that He now enjoys in all the heavens.

He is the sovereign king of a whole universe.

FAITH BIBLE CHURCH OF AFRICA, INC. 
_“Go ye therefore and teach all nations”_ [Matt:28:19](/en/Bible/Matthew/28#v19).

Rev. Godwin A. Ikoro, Founder and general superintendent 
P.O. Box 401
Satellite Town, Lagos
Nigeria, West Africa

Monday, June 3, 1991

Beloved and Precious Chrissy Smith,

Greetings to you all in the Holy and Merciful Name of our dear Lord, the Father, I pray that this mail will meet you in good health and I hope that you will read through it in good faith. Beloved, kindly extend my brotherly salutations to those loving saints with you over there.

I am really very convinced that you will be wondering who must have written you this mail from that far away country like (Nigeria), West Africa. I so much believe that this is just the very way the Lord wants it, as to join us together in this form. My prayer is that let no man put this great relationship of ours asunder, unto the end.

To start with, I am in the person of REVEREND GODWIN A. IKORO, the founder and general superintendent of Faith Bible Church of Africa, Inc. As well as leader of study group of Urantia Books, in Nigeria. And I am basesd in Lagos, the Federal capitol of Nigeria. And I came to know of you through one of the newest magazines published by the Fifth Epochal Fellowship, called “The STUDY GROUP HERALD, Vol. 1 , No. 1, Spring 1991”, issue. In fact, I have been praying that I should one day have a friend and brother whom I would be corresponding with and who is also a reader of Urantia Books. I thank God, because, He has done it for me by making me to know you today.

It now seems like my thoughts and dreams on this issue have become a reality. I hope you may be sending me from time to time some Urantia Books for our use here. We are numbering over 45 members. We have our newly constituted Board Members of Urantia Study Group. I am therefore, enclosing to you the picture of these, our newly constituted Board Members, for you to see them while I plead that you should try your very best and send me some of your USED MATERIALS OF URANTIA BOOKS.

Here in Lagos I am a missionary, and I am 45 years of age with 11 children, whom God Has blessed to my dear wife, Sister Mercy and myself. I would love to have your own picture as you reply to this letter Beloved. _Because, there is something very spoecial about having a visual picture of the person one worites to, or prays for_. Therefore, try your best and let me have and share your picture with my family and the entire members of Urantia Study Group here in Lagos. I am therefore, looking forward to having your soon coming reply within the week and I pray that you should try and mail me some of your used _Urantia Books_. Beloved, I love you and I continue to back you day by day in my prayers. I also pray for all the members of your loving family as well as the members of your study group over there.

May God, our Father, bless you all as you reply within the week Beloved. Yours United in the Spirit of Christ Jesus. Rev. Godwin A Ikoro, (Leader) URANTIA STUDY GROUP, Lagos.
