And everything is upside down, 
like faces mirrored in a bowl: 
an earthen vessel, roughly formed, 
that's full of water while the one 
who once was robed, incomp'rable, 
in light removes his outer robe 
to tie a tow'l, a servant's garb, 
around his waist and stoops to wash
his foll'wer's feet of traces from 
the dusty Roman roads they've walked.
Yes everything is upside down 
for whom in all this world would like 
to think that him whose praise we sang,
“Hosanna to King David's son,”
should stoop to take a servant's part.
Oh we would rather he should reign 
on high with us at his right hand.
But Servant Lord, incomp'rable, 
you call us to remove our pride, 
an outer robe, and stoop to wash 
all others' feet: humility,
and thrust down deep our dusty feet
to take the love you offer us
into the bowl reflecting you.
