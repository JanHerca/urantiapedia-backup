As chair of the Finance Committee I have the privilege of working with a great team who has the responsibility of raising money so the Fellowship can carry out its mission and activities. In cooperation with the other service teams and committee chairs we prepare the annual budget, submit it to the Executive Committee and arrange for an annual audit.

Currently I'm working with my committee to raise money for the next printing of _The Urantia Book_. The Uversa Press edition is the only two column, indexed version of the book, and by providing multiple printings we help to keep the cost of the book down. For many of us, the cost of the book is now less than it was when we first bought it! Please help us continue to keep the book affordable by giving generously.

In addition to the costs of maintaining an office with a full-time and half-time employee, and publishing the book, there are many additional expenses incurred in fulfilling our mission to spread _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. We produce and mail printed publications The Fellowship Herald and The Mighty Messenger; send representatives with books and materials to major interfaith events such as the Wild Goose Festival and the Parliament of World Religions; exhibit at public expos; create media productions; and broadcast a weekly radio program.

Volunteers provide most of the time and effort, and often the expense, but donations are needed to offset the costs associated with their efforts.

This year we are creating a new website and are currently migrating all relevant material and data, including our voluminous resource library of study aids, to the new Wild Apricot site. Our website enables us to reach youth and international readers, but there are costs involved in attending expos and sponsoring emerging students as we work to engage youth and young adults, and to build our international community.

We send out an annual appeal for donations and we are currently working on a Planned Giving program that will help supporters to include the Fellowship in their estate planning, thus ensuring that our work continues. In addition to your volunteer efforts you can help build a community whose purpose is to spread _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings by donating online at: https://urantiabook.worldsecuresystems.com/donation
