Come on everyone, let's get this Chinese translation finished so that we can offer the Master's teachings to our brethren, the yellow race. Let's contribute whatever we can spare to Urantia Foundation's translation fund to finance this crucially important translation for the benefit of much of China's 1-2 billion people.

These are the days we are given. Great days for us to “be about the Father's business,” great days to attempt to extend the Kingdom of Heaven. And it seems we are the fortunate few blessed with this unique opportunity of rendering this supernal service to our fellows in the East.

In conjunction with caring for our immediate families, what greater investment can we possibly make than to help fund the spreading of our beloved Sovereign's teachings to the uttermost parts of the earth? What a tremendous return such an investment may yield, not merely for ourselves, but for all future generations! Beyond Kingdom building in our own homes, cities, and nations, what greater good can we possibly do? And the sooner such a task is completed, the sooner this blessed text can be made available to what in this case would prove to be no small fraction of the entire human race.

How can we ever be depressed or downhearted when confronted with such magnificent opportunities for thrilling service? How can transient darkness ever demoralize or dissuade us when ways forward such as these open up before us?

So come on, chaps, let's unite and serve, for our time on this Earth is short and the need of the hour is great. Let's all, sisters and brothers together, despite what we each may have contributed previously, pull again with one accord, for these are the days we are given — days to cherish for all future time.
