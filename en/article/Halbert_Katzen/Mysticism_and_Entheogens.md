## Introduction

This study aid was inspired by other study aid efforts on prophecy. If you are unfamiliar with how full solar eclipses intersecting over Bald Knob Cross of Peace on August 21, 2017 and April 8, 2024 relate to prophecies and _Urantia Book_ teachings, this brief article—“[Eclipses Trump Prophecy Scholars](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Eclipses_Trump_Prophecy_Scholars)“—will get you quickly up to speed on this exciting development.

The particular facts and teachings concerning the eclipses more generally raise questions about the nature of [Saints, Prophets, Seers, and Heralds: Who is who? What is what? When? And why?](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Saints_prophets_seers_and_heralds) Work on this broader subject required consideration of these roles both individually and together.

The seer role, in particular, is mysterious, by nature. It relates to mystic tendencies and practices. Seers and prophets have a tradition (more than saints and heralds, anyway) for the willingness to use psychoactive substances—_entheogens_. Issues related to that tradition are the focus of this study.

Word searches performed for this study include and go beyond permutations of _mystic, mystery, intoxicate, drug, poison, narcotized, addict, alcohol,_ and _wine._

Additionally, it should be noted, musicians have gratefully acknowledged help from the spirit world for ages, the Greek muses being one example.

Being musical intensifies physical, mindal, and spiritual energies in a manner that encourages spontaneous expression. Vocalists often “tap in” to this during performances, as do other public performs and speakers, like politicians and preachers.

The question of whether Bob Marley is the person referenced in the paragraph below especially led to this study.

> While you have assembled some beautiful melodies on Urantia, you have not progressed musically nearly so far as many of your neighboring planets in Satania. If Adam and Eve had only survived, then would you have had music in reality; but the gift of harmony, so large in their natures, has been so diluted by strains of unmusical tendencies that only once in a thousand mortal lives is there any great appreciation of harmonics. But be not discouraged; some day a real musician may appear on Urantia, and whole peoples will be enthralled by the magnificent strains of his melodies. One such human being could forever change the course of a whole nation, even the entire civilized world. It is literally true, “melody has power a whole world to transform.” Forever, music will remain the universal language of men, angels, and spirits. Harmony is the speech of Havona. ([UB 44:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p1_15))

Attempts to reach the spirit world in front of live audiences requires a degree of spiritual (not necessarily religious) courage and this relates to psychic energy and forces. It is important to remember that some people tap in and express highly irreverent thoughts. “The sun shines on the just and the unjust.” And across the spectrum of dispositions, psychoactive substances are sometimes, but not always, involved.

Before getting started with the categories with select passages, best to review the following two sections:

- [Mysticism, Ecstasy, and Inspiration](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7)
- [Conversion and Mysticism](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5)

## Physiologically and Psychologically

How are we wired?

> Always keep in mind: True religion is to know God as your Father and man as your brother. Religion is not a slavish belief in threats of punishment or magical promises of future mystical rewards. ([UB 99:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_2))

> Faith leads to knowing God, not merely to a mystical feeling of the divine presence. Faith must not be overmuch influenced by its emotional consequences. True religion is an experience of believing and knowing as well as a satisfaction of feeling. ([UB 103:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_11))

> 3\. _Spirit-reception series._ There are three groups of mind design as related to contact with spirit affairs. This classification does not refer to the one-, two-, and three-brained orders of mortals; it refers primarily to gland chemistry, more particularly to the organization of certain glands comparable to the pituitary bodies. The races on some worlds have one gland, on others two, as do Urantians, while on still other spheres the races have three of these unique bodies. The inherent imagination and spiritual receptivity is definitely influenced by this differential chemical endowment.
> 
> Of the spirit-reception types, sixty-five per cent are of the second group, like the Urantia races. Twelve per cent are of the first type, naturally less receptive, while twenty-three per cent are more spiritually inclined during terrestrial life. But such distinctions do not survive natural death; all of these racial differences pertain only to the life in the flesh. ([UB 49:5.19-20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_19))

Consider how the fundamental challenge related to mystic experienced is summed up here:

> **Mysticism, as the technique of the cultivation of the consciousness of the presence of God, is altogether praiseworthy, but when such practices lead to social isolation and culminate in religious fanaticism, they are all but reprehensible.** Altogether too frequently that which the **overwrought mystic** evaluates as divine inspiration is the uprisings of his own deep mind. The contact of the mortal mind with its indwelling Adjuster, while often favored by devoted meditation, is more frequently facilitated by wholehearted and loving service in unselfish ministry to one’s fellow creatures. ([UB 91:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_1))

Adding to this challenge for _Urantia Book_ students is figuring out how to interpret the following:

> The Adjuster remains with you in all disaster and through every sickness which does not wholly destroy the mentality. **But how unkind knowingly to defile or otherwise deliberately to pollute the physical body, which must serve as the earthly tabernacle of this marvelous gift from God. All physical poisons greatly retard the efforts of the Adjuster to exalt the material mind, while the mental poisons of fear, anger, envy, jealousy, suspicion, and intolerance likewise tremendously interfere with the spiritual progress of the evolving soul.** ([UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5))

Is a alcohol a physical poison? Obviously, people become addicted to it and die. If we label it a poison, then how do we square it these passages?:

> While no sacrifices were permitted within the colony, Melchizedek well knew how difficult it is to suddenly uproot long-established customs and accordingly had wisely offered these people the substitute of a sacrament of bread and wine for the older sacrifice of flesh and blood. **It is of record, “Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine.”** But even this cautious innovation was not altogether successful; the various tribes all maintained auxiliary centers on the outskirts of Salem where they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings. Even Abraham resorted to this barbarous practice after his victory over Chedorlaomer; he simply did not feel quite at ease until he had offered a conventional sacrifice. And Melchizedek never did succeed in fully eradicating this proclivity to sacrifice from the religious practices of his followers, even of Abraham. ([UB 93:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p4_14))

> Throughout a period of many years, Mary had always turned to Jesus for help in every crisis of their home life at Nazareth so that it was only natural for her to think of him at this time. But this ambitious mother had still other motives for appealing to her eldest son on this occasion. As Jesus was standing alone in a corner of the garden, his mother approached him, saying, “My son, they have no wine.” And Jesus answered, “My good woman, what have I to do with that?” Said Mary, “But I believe your hour has come; cannot you help us?” Jesus replied: “Again I declare that I have not come to do things in this wise. Why do you trouble me again with these matters?” And then, breaking down in tears, Mary entreated him, “But, my son, I promised them that you would help us; won’t you please do something for me?” And then spoke Jesus: “Woman, what have you to do with making such promises? See that you do it not again. We must in all things wait upon the will of the Father in heaven.” ([UB 137:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_8))

> Mary the mother of Jesus was crushed; she was stunned! As she stood there before him motionless, with the tears streaming down her face, the human heart of Jesus was overcome with compassion for the woman who had borne him in the flesh; and bending forward, he laid his hand tenderly upon her head, saying: “Now, now, Mother Mary, grieve not over my apparently hard sayings, for have I not many times told you that I have come only to do the will of my heavenly Father? Most gladly would I do what you ask of me if it were a part of the Father’s will—” and Jesus stopped short, he hesitated. Mary seemed to sense that something was happening. Leaping up, she threw her arms around Jesus’ neck, kissed him, and rushed off to the servants’ quarters, saying, “Whatever my son says, that do.” But Jesus said nothing. He now realized that he had already said—or rather desirefully thought—too much. ([UB 137:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_9))

> As they brought Jesus the third cup of wine, the “cup of blessing,” he arose from the couch and, taking the cup in his hands, blessed it, saying: “Take this cup, all of you, and drink of it. This shall be the cup of my remembrance. This is the cup of the blessing of a new dispensation of grace and truth. This shall be to you the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth. And I will not again drink this cup with you until I drink in new form with you in the Father’s eternal kingdom.” ([UB 179:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_1))

And if wine can be used a sacrament by Melchizedek and Jesus, what about cannabis and other psychoactive substances associated with entheogenic experiences?

Consider how some of the forces and factors related to releasing psychic energy are universally bestowed. “The sun shines on the just and the unjust.”

> The human mind may perform in response to so-called inspiration when it is sensitive either to the uprisings of the subconscious or to the stimulus of the superconscious. In either case it appears to the individual that such augmentations of the content of consciousness are more or less foreign. **Unrestrained mystical enthusiasm and rampant religious ecstasy are not the credentials of inspiration, supposedly divine credentials.** ([UB 91:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_4))

> If one is disposed to recognize a theoretical subconscious mind as a practical working hypothesis in the otherwise unified intellectual life, then, to be consistent, one should postulate a similar and corresponding realm of ascending intellectual activity as the superconscious level, the zone of immediate contact with the indwelling spirit entity, the Thought Adjuster. **The great danger in all these psychic speculations is that visions and other so-called mystic experiences, along with extraordinary dreams, may be regarded as divine communications to the human mind.** In times past, divine beings have revealed themselves to certain God-knowing persons, not because of their **mystic** trances or morbid visions, but in spite of all these phenomena. ([UB 100:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_6))

> Again, there are other types of unstable and poorly disciplined souls who would use the sentimental ideas of religion as an avenue of escape from the irritating demands of living. When certain vacillating and timid mortals attempt to escape from the incessant pressure of evolutionary life, religion, as they conceive it, seems to present the nearest refuge, the best avenue of escape. But it is the mission of religion to prepare man for bravely, even heroically, facing the vicissitudes of life. Religion is evolutionary man’s supreme endowment, the one thing which enables him to carry on and “endure as seeing Him who is invisible.” **Mysticism, however, is often something of a retreat from life which is embraced by those humans who do not relish the more robust activities of living a religious life in the open arenas of human society and commerce. True religion must _act._** Conduct will be the result of religion when man actually has it, or rather when religion is permitted truly to possess the man. Never will religion be content with mere thinking or unacting feeling. ([UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8))

> The characteristics of the mystical state are diffusion of consciousness with vivid islands of focal attention operating on a comparatively passive intellect. All of this gravitates consciousness toward the subconscious rather than in the direction of the zone of spiritual contact, the superconscious. **Many mystics have carried their mental dissociation to the level of abnormal mental manifestations.** ([UB 100:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_9))

> The more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. The direct communion with one’s Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus’ life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called **mystical** experiences. The factors which contribute to the initiation of **mystic** communion are indicative of the danger of such psychic states. The **mystic status is favored by such things as:** physical fatigue, fasting, psychic dissociation, profound aesthetic experiences, vivid sex impulses, fear, anxiety, rage, and wild dancing. Much of the material arising as a result of such preliminary preparation has its origin in the subconscious mind. ([UB 100:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_10))

> Religion lives and prospers, then, not by sight and feeling, but rather by faith and insight. It consists not in the discovery of new facts or in the finding of a unique experience, but rather in the discovery of new and spiritual _meanings_ in facts already well known to mankind. **The highest religious experience is not dependent on prior acts of belief, tradition, and authority; neither is religion the offspring of sublime feelings and purely mystical emotions.** It is, rather, a profoundly deep and actual experience of spiritual communion with the spirit influences resident within the human mind, and as far as such an experience is definable in terms of psychology, it is simply the experience of experiencing the reality of believing in God as the reality of such a purely personal experience. ([UB 101:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_4))

> “Much of my difficulty was due to the unending conflict between the two natures of my subject: the urge of ambition opposed by animal indolence; the ideals of a superior people crossed by the instincts of an inferior race; the high purposes of a great mind antagonized by the urge of a primitive inheritance; the long-distance view of a far-seeing Monitor counteracted by the nearsightedness of a creature of time; the progressive plans of an ascending being modified by the desires and longings of a material nature; **the flashes of universe intelligence cancelled by the chemical-energy mandates of the evolving race**; the urge of angels opposed by the emotions of an animal; the training of an intellect annulled by the tendencies of instinct; the experience of the individual opposed by the accumulated propensities of the race; the aims of the best overshadowed by the drift of the worst; the flight of genius neutralized by the gravity of mediocrity; the progress of the good retarded by the inertia of the bad; the art of the beautiful besmirched by the presence of evil; the buoyancy of health neutralized by the debility of disease; **the fountain of faith polluted by the poisons of fear**; the spring of joy embittered by the waters of sorrow; the gladness of anticipation disillusioned by the bitterness of realization; the joys of living ever threatened by the sorrows of death. Such a life on such a planet! And yet, because of the ever-present help and urge of the Thought Adjuster, this soul did achieve a fair degree of happiness and success and has even now ascended to the judgment halls of mansonia.” ([UB 111:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_5))

> When the philosophy of man leans heavily toward the world of matter, it becomes rationalistic or _naturalistic._ When philosophy inclines particularly toward the spiritual level, it becomes _idealistic_ or even mystical. When philosophy is so unfortunate as to lean upon metaphysics, it unfailingly becomes _skeptical,_ confused. In past ages, most of man’s knowledge and intellectual evaluations have fallen into one of these three distortions of perception. Philosophy dare not project its interpretations of reality in the linear fashion of logic; it must never fail to reckon with the elliptic symmetry of reality and with the essential curvature of all relation concepts. ([UB 103:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_14))

## Fourth Epochal Revelation

### John the Baptist

> John had no school from which to graduate at the age of fourteen, but his parents had selected this as the appropriate year for him to take the formal Nazarite vow. Accordingly, Zacharias and Elizabeth took their son to Engedi, down by the Dead Sea. This was the southern headquarters of the Nazarite brotherhood, and there the lad was duly and solemnly inducted into this order for life. **After these ceremonies and the making of the vows to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, to let the hair grow**, and to refrain from touching the dead, the family proceeded to Jerusalem, where, before the temple, John completed the making of the offerings which were required of those taking Nazarite vows. ([UB 135:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_1))

> When sixteen years old, John, as a result of reading about Elijah, became greatly impressed with the prophet of Mount Carmel and decided to adopt his style of dress. From that day on John always wore a hairy garment with a leather girdle. **At sixteen he was more than six feet tall and almost full grown. With his flowing hair and peculiar mode of dress he was indeed a picturesque youth.** And his parents expected great things of this their only son, a child of promise and a Nazarite for life. ([UB 135:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_4))

> **It was the influence of Elijah that caused John to adopt his methods of direct and blunt assault upon the sins and vices of his contemporaries. He sought to dress like Elijah, and he endeavored to talk like Elijah; in every outward aspect he was like the olden prophet. He was just such a stalwart and picturesque child of nature, just such a fearless and daring preacher of righteousness.** John was not illiterate, he did well know the Jewish sacred writings, but he was hardly cultured. He was a clear thinker, a powerful speaker, and a fiery denunciator. **He was hardly an example to his age, but he was an eloquent rebuke.** ([UB 135:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_5))

> **It was apparent to all who heard John that he was more than a preacher. The great majority of those who listened to this strange man who had come up from the Judean wilderness went away believing that they had heard the voice of a prophet.** No wonder the souls of these weary and expectant Jews were deeply stirred by such a phenomenon. Never in all Jewish history had the devout children of Abraham so longed for the “consolation of Israel” or more ardently anticipated “the restoration of the kingdom.” **Never in all Jewish history could John’s message, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” have made such a deep and universal appeal as at the very time he so mysteriously appeared on the bank of this southern crossing of the Jordan.** ([UB 135:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p6_2))

### Intoxication of the Apostles

Note here how the Revelators consider intoxication as a state of mind that does not necessarily involve ingesting a substance.

> Throughout the evening following this great outburst of healing, the rejoicing and happy throng overran Zebedee’s home, and the apostles of Jesus were keyed up to the highest pitch of emotional enthusiasm. From a human standpoint, this was probably the greatest day of all the great days of their association with Jesus. At no time before or after did their hopes surge to such heights of confident expectation. Jesus had told them only a few days before, and when they were yet within the borders of Samaria, that the hour had come when the kingdom was to be proclaimed in _power,_ and now their eyes had seen what they supposed was the fulfillment of that promise. They were thrilled by the vision of what was to come if this amazing manifestation of healing power was just the beginning. **Their lingering doubts of Jesus’ divinity were banished. They were literally intoxicated with the ecstasy of their bewildered enchantment.** ([UB 145:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_1))

 > **Judas returned to his associates at the camp intoxicated with thoughts of grandeur and glory such as he had not had for many a day.** He had enlisted with Jesus hoping some day to become a great man in the new kingdom. He at last realized that there was to be no new kingdom such as he had anticipated. But he rejoiced in being so sagacious as to trade off his disappointment in failing to achieve glory in an anticipated new kingdom for the immediate realization of honor and reward in the old order, which he now believed would survive, and which he was certain would destroy Jesus and all that he stood for. In its last motive of conscious intention, Judas’s betrayal of Jesus was the cowardly act of a selfish deserter whose only thought was his own safety and glorification, no matter what might be the results of his conduct upon his Master and upon his former associates. ([UB 177:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p4_9))

> As Judas left the Sanhedrin chamber, he removed the thirty pieces of silver from the bag and threw them broadcast over the temple floor. When the betrayer left the temple, he was almost beside himself. Judas was now passing through the experience of the realization of the true nature of sin. **All the glamor, fascination, and intoxication of wrongdoing had vanished.** Now the evildoer stood alone and face to face with the judgment verdict of his disillusioned and disappointed soul. Sin was bewitching and adventurous in the committing, but now must the harvest of the naked and unromantic facts be faced. ([UB 186:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p1_6))

### Jesus

> While turning all these problems over in his mind, he found in the synagogue library at Nazareth, among the apocalyptic books which he had been studying, this manuscript called “The Book of Enoch”; and though he was certain that it had not been written by Enoch of old, it proved very intriguing to him, and he read and reread it many times. There was one passage which particularly impressed him, a passage in which this term “Son of Man” appeared. The writer of this so-called Book of Enoch went on to tell about this Son of Man, describing the work he would do on earth and explaining that this Son of Man, before coming down on this earth to bring salvation to mankind, had walked through the courts of heavenly glory with his Father, the Father of all; and that he had turned his back upon all this grandeur and glory to come down on earth to proclaim salvation to needy mortals. **As Jesus would read these passages (well understanding that much of the Eastern mysticism which had become admixed with these teachings was erroneous),** he responded in his heart and recognized in his mind that of all the Messianic predictions of the Hebrew scriptures and of all the theories about the Jewish deliverer, none was so near the truth as this story tucked away in this only partially accredited Book of Enoch; and he then and there decided to adopt as his inaugural title “the Son of Man.” And this he did when he subsequently began his public work. Jesus had an unerring ability for the recognition of truth, and truth he never hesitated to embrace, no matter from what source it appeared to emanate. ([UB 126:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_8))

> **You are not to be passive mystics or colorless ascetics**; you should not become dreamers and drifters, supinely trusting in a fictitious Providence to provide even the necessities of life. You are indeed to be gentle in your dealings with erring mortals, patient in your intercourse with ignorant men, and forbearing under provocation; but you are also to be valiant in defense of righteousness, mighty in the promulgation of truth, and aggressive in the preaching of this gospel of the kingdom, even to the ends of the earth. ([UB 178:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_14))

> As he grew up to manhood, he passed through all those conflicts and confusions which the average young persons of previous and subsequent ages have undergone. And the rigorous experience of supporting his family was a sure safeguard against his having overmuch time for idle meditation or the **indulgence of mystic tendencies**. ([UB 126:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_9))

> However favorable may have been the conditions for **mystic phenomena**, it should be clearly understood that Jesus of Nazareth never resorted to such methods for communion with the Paradise Father. Jesus had no subconscious delusions or superconscious illusions. ([UB 100:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_11))

> … Nathaniel and Thomas jointly presented their views of the divine nature of the Master, and the following narrative is a condensed, rearranged, and restated presentation of their teaching: ([UB 161:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p2_1))

> 5\. He seems to know the thoughts of men’s minds and to understand the longings of their hearts. And he is always sympathetic with our troubled spirits. He seems to possess all our human emotions, but they are magnificently glorified. He strongly loves goodness and equally hates sin. He possesses a superhuman consciousness of the presence of Deity. He prays like a man but performs like a God. He seems to foreknow things; he even now dares to speak about his death, some **mystic reference to his future glorification**. While he is kind, he is also brave and courageous. He never falters in doing his duty. ([UB 161:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p2_6))

> In the Master’s life on Urantia, this and all other worlds of the local creation discover a new and higher type of religion, religion based on personal spiritual relations with the Universal Father and wholly validated by the supreme authority of genuine personal experience. This living faith of Jesus was more than an intellectual reflection, and **it was not a mystic meditation**. ([UB 196:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_4))

> Crucifixion was resorted to in order to provide a cruel and lingering punishment, the victim sometimes not dying for several days. There was considerable sentiment against crucifixion in Jerusalem, and there existed a society of Jewish women who always sent a representative to crucifixions for the purpose of offering **drugged wine to the victim in order to lessen his suffering.** But when Jesus tasted this narcotized wine, as thirsty as he was, he refused to drink it. The Master chose to retain his human consciousness until the very end. He desired to meet death, even in this cruel and inhuman form, and conquer it by voluntary submission to the full human experience. ([UB 187:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_3))

> If religion is an opiate to the people, it is not the religion of Jesus. On the cross **he refused to drink the deadening drug**, and his spirit, poured out upon all flesh, is a mighty world influence which leads man upward and urges him onward. The spiritual forward urge is the most powerful driving force present in this world; the truth-learning believer is the one progressive and aggressive soul on earth. ([UB 194:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_4))

### Christian mysticism

> The pictures of Jesus have been most unfortunate. These paintings of the Christ have exerted a deleterious influence on youth; the temple merchants would hardly have fled before Jesus if he had been such a man as your artists usually have depicted. His was a dignified manhood; he was good, but natural. **Jesus did not pose as a mild, sweet, gentle, and kindly mystic**. His teaching was thrillingly dynamic. He not only _meant well,_ but he went about actually _doing good._ ([UB 141:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_6))

> The kingdom of Jesus’ teaching, the spiritual ideal of individual righteousness and the concept of man’s divine fellowship with God, became gradually submerged into the **mystic conception of the person of Jesus** as the Redeemer-Creator and spiritual head of a socialized religious community. In this way a formal and institutional church became the substitute for the individually spirit-led brotherhood of the kingdom. ([UB 170:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_9))

> The church, being an adjunct to society and the ally of politics, was doomed to share in the intellectual and spiritual decline of the so-called European “dark ages.” During this time, religion became more and more monasticized, asceticized, and legalized. In a spiritual sense, Christianity was hibernating. Throughout this period there existed, alongside this slumbering and secularized religion, a continuous stream of mysticism, a fantastic spiritual experience bordering on unreality and philosophically akin to pantheism. ([UB 195:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_1))

## Evolutionary Development

Consider the tolerance for alcohol and other entheogens in light of evolutionary developments:

> The sun god was supposed to be the **mystic father** of the virgin-born sons of destiny who ever and anon were thought to be bestowed as saviors upon favored races. These supernatural infants were always put adrift upon some sacred river to be rescued in an extraordinary manner, after which they would grow up to become miraculous personalities and the deliverers of their peoples. ([UB 85:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p5_3))

> And so, after long ages the cult of the sacrifice has evolved into the cult of the sacrament. Thus are the sacraments of modern religions the legitimate successors of those shocking early ceremonies of human sacrifice and the still earlier cannibalistic rituals. Many still depend upon blood for salvation, but it has at least become **figurative, symbolic, and** **mystic**. ([UB 89:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p9_4))

> Religion progressed from nature worship up through ghost worship to fetishism throughout the savage childhood of the races. With the dawn of civilization the human race espoused the **more mystic and symbolic beliefs**, while now, with approaching maturity, mankind is ripening for the appreciation of real religion, even a beginning of the revelation of truth itself. ([UB 92:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_2))

> During these spiritually dark ages the culture of superstitious mankind reached its lowest levels. The Neanderthalers really had no religion beyond a **shameful superstition. They were deathly afraid of clouds, more especially of mists and fogs.** A primitive religion of the fear of natural forces gradually developed, while animal worship declined as improvement in tools, with abundance of game, enabled these people to live with lessened anxiety about food; the sex rewards of the chase tended greatly to improve hunting skill. This new religion of fear led to attempts to placate the invisible forces behind these natural elements and culminated, later on, in the sacrificing of humans to appease these invisible and unknown physical forces. And this terrible practice of human sacrifice has been perpetuated by the more backward peoples of Urantia right on down to the twentieth century. ([UB 64:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_12))

> 8\. _Numerous forms of self-gratification._ Some sought wealth because it conferred power; others toiled for property because it meant ease. Early man (and some later-day ones) tended to squander his resources on luxury. **Intoxicants and drugs intrigued the primitive races**. ([UB 69:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p5_11))

> Unscrupulous rulers gained great power by the discovery of **poison**. Early court magic was diabolical; the king’s enemies soon died. But even the most despotic tyrant was subject to some restrictions; he was at least restrained by the ever-present fear of assassination. The medicine men, witch doctors, and priests have always been a powerful check on the kings. Subsequently, the landowners, the aristocracy, exerted a restraining influence. And ever and anon the clans and tribes would simply rise up and overthrow their despots and tyrants. Deposed rulers, when sentenced to death, were often given the option of committing suicide, which gave origin to the ancient social vogue of suicide in certain circumstances. ([UB 70:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p6_6))

> **Plants were first feared and then worshiped because of the intoxicating liquors which were derived therefrom. Primitive man believed that intoxication rendered one divine**. There was supposed to be something unusual and sacred about such an experience. Even in modern times alcohol is known as “spirits.” ([UB 85:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_1))

> **Magical charms were concocted** from a great variety of things: human flesh, tiger claws, crocodile teeth, **poison plant seeds**, snake venom, and human hair. The bones of the dead were very magical. Even the dust from footprints could be used in magic. The ancients were great believers in love charms. Blood and other forms of bodily secretions were able to insure the magic influence of love. ([UB 88:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p5_2))

> Hunchbacked and crippled children were regarded as fetishes; lunatics were believed to be moon-struck. Primitive man could not distinguish between genius and insanity; idiots were either beaten to death or revered as fetish personalities. Hysteria increasingly confirmed the popular belief in witchcraft; epileptics often were priests and medicine men. Drunkenness was looked upon as a form of spirit possession; when a savage went on a spree, he put a leaf in his hair for the purpose of disavowing responsibility for his acts. **Poisons and intoxicants became fetishes; they were deemed to be possessed**. ([UB 88:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p1_9))

> The Hebrews worshiped serpents down to the days of King Hezekiah, and the Hindus still maintain friendly relations with their house snakes. The Chinese worship of the dragon is a survival of the snake cults. The wisdom of the serpent was a symbol of Greek medicine and is still employed as an emblem by modern physicians. The art of snake charming has been handed down from the days of the **female shamans of the _snake love cult,_ who, as the result of daily snake bites, became immune, in fact, became genuine venom addicts and could not get along without this poison**. ([UB 85:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_3))

> Blood kinship determined the first social groups; association enlarged the kinship clan. Intermarriage was the next step in group enlargement, and the resultant complex tribe was the first true political body. The next advance in social development was the evolution of religious cults and the political clubs. These first appeared as secret societies and originally were wholly religious; subsequently they became regulative. At first they were men’s clubs; later women’s groups appeared. Presently they became divided into two classes: sociopolitical and **religio-mystical**. ([UB 70:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_1))

> 8\. _Religious—_the early cult clubs produced their own classes within the clans and tribes, and the **piety and mysticism of the priests have long perpetuated them** as a separate social group. ([UB 70:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p8_10))

> But not all shamans were self-deceived; many were shrewd and able tricksters. As the profession developed, a novice was required to serve an apprenticeship of ten years of hardship and self-denial to qualify as a medicine man. The shamans developed a professional mode of dress and affected a **mysterious** conduct. **They frequently employed drugs to induce certain physical states which would impress and mystify the tribesmen**. Sleight-of-hand feats were regarded as supernatural by the common folk, and ventriloquism was first used by shrewd priests. Many of the olden shamans unwittingly stumbled onto **hypnotism**; others induced autohypnosis by prolonged staring at their navels. ([UB 90:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p1_4))

> The priests have always sought to impress and awe the common people by conducting the religious ritual in an ancient tongue and by **sundry magical passes so to mystify the worshipers** as to enhance their own piety and authority. The great danger in all this is that the ritual tends to become a substitute for religion. ([UB 90:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p5_6))

> These simple-minded Tibetans would not wholly give up their ancient magic and charms. Examination of the religious ceremonials of present-day Tibetan rituals reveals an overgrown brotherhood of priests with shaven heads who practice an elaborate ritual embracing bells, chants, incense, processionals, rosaries, images, charms, pictures, holy water, gorgeous vestments, and elaborate choirs. They have rigid dogmas and crystallized creeds, **mystic rites** and special fasts. Their hierarchy embraces monks, nuns, abbots, and the Grand Lama. They pray to angels, saints, a Holy Mother, and the gods. They practice confessions and believe in purgatory. Their monasteries are extensive and their cathedrals magnificent. They keep up an endless repetition of sacred rituals and believe that such ceremonials bestow salvation. Prayers are fastened to a wheel, and with its turning they believe the petitions become efficacious. Among no other people of modern times can be found the observance of so much from so many religions; and it is inevitable that such a cumulative liturgy would become inordinately cumbersome and intolerably burdensome. ([UB 94:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p10_2))

> The moral commandments of Gautama’s preachment were five in number: ([UB 94:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p8_9))

> 5\. **You shall not drink intoxicating liquors**. ([UB 94:8.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p8_14))

> Many, but not all, of Philo’s inconsistencies resulting from an effort to combine Greek **mystical** philosophy and Roman Stoic doctrines with the legalistic theology of the Hebrews, Paul recognized and wisely eliminated from his pre-Christian basic theology. Philo led the way for Paul more fully to restore the concept of the Paradise Trinity, which had long been dormant in Jewish theology. In only one matter did Paul fail to keep pace with Philo or to transcend the teachings of this wealthy and educated Jew of Alexandria, and that was the doctrine of the atonement; Philo taught deliverance from the doctrine of forgiveness only by the shedding of blood. He also possibly glimpsed the reality and presence of the Thought Adjusters more clearly than did Paul. But Paul’s theory of original sin, the doctrines of hereditary guilt and innate evil and redemption therefrom, was partially Mithraic in origin, having little in common with Hebrew theology, Philo’s philosophy, or Jesus’ teachings. Some phases of Paul’s teachings regarding original sin and the atonement were original with himself. ([UB 121:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p6_5))

> **The great religious teachers and the prophets of past ages were not extreme mystics.** They were God-knowing men and women who best served their God by unselfish ministry to their fellow mortals. Jesus often took his apostles away by themselves for short periods to engage in meditation and prayer, but for the most part he kept them in service-contact with the multitudes. The soul of man requires spiritual exercise as well as spiritual nourishment. ([UB 91:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_2))
