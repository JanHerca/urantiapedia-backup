_By Halbert Katzen J.D._

The word _undiscovered_ is used 13 times in 11 paragraphs_._ The first five paragraphs associate what is _undiscovered_ with energy. Then, when explaining the Limitations on Revelation, it is used in relationship to undiscovered facts. The last three paragraphs all have to do with undiscovered ideals.

Note below (42:8.6) how the revelators seem to suggest that discovering the undiscovered energy is related to understanding the difference between _cohesion_ and _adhesion_ as these forces are related to the proton and neutron, respectively.

There is substantial evidence to suggest that [Joseph Wesley Newman developed a unified field theory](https://ubannotated.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Newman-J-Book.pdf) ([Part II](https://ubannotated.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Newman2.pdf)) that makes it possible to tap into this undiscovered energy. The previous two links take you to PDF’s that are easy to read and go through the first 111 pages of Joseph Newman’s book, which has detailed descriptions, photographs, and graphic aids detailing how his understanding of science and his technology works. [This link](https://archive.org/details/TheEnergyMachineOfJosephNewman8thEdition/mode/2up) takes you to the complete text of the last edition, but the quality is not quite as good.

An example of the ongoing and organized effort to misrepresent the facts of his life and work can be seen here on Wikipedia: [Newman’s energy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newman%27s_energy_machine):

In 1979, Newman submitted an application for his device to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The application was eventually rejected in 1983, which set off a lengthy court battle. The United States District Court requested a master of the court to make the final decision. William E. Schuyler, Jr, former Commissioner of U.S. Patent Office, Washington, DC was chosen by the court to make the final decision to award the patent or not award the patent to Newman. Schuyler supposed that evidence to support Newman’s claim was overwhelming and found no contradictory factual evidence.

However, the judge ordered Newman’s machine to be tested by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), by request of the patent office, tested the device for several months and got negative results. In every case presented in the NBS report, the output power was less than power input from the battery pack, and therefore the efficiency was less than 100%. The court therefore upheld the rejection of the patent application.

Notice how this write up implies [William E. Schuyler, Jr.](https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/william-e-schuyler-jr) (both an electrical engineer and an attorney) did not test the machine but just “supposed” things in order to make his decision. Do you really think that he was called in “by the court to make the final decision” but did not take the time to sufficiently test the machine? Why would the judge refuse to accept the findings of the special master that he hired?

A review of the facts reveals that Newman’s machine is not supposed to be grounded. The National Bureau of Standards knew this and grounded the machine before testing it. Schuyler tested it as it was intended to operated, ungrounded.

This [Newman documentary](https://rumble.com/vsylvs-the-secrets-of-free-energy-by-joseph-newman..html) is highly recommended!

This is a [30-minute video of Joseph Newman](https://bit.ly/3XkUpIH), explaining how he got the intellectual breakthrough that led to the development of his understanding of electromagnetics and his ability to build a machine based on that understanding.

> Ever and anon, true prophets and teachers arose to denounce and expose shamanism. Even the vanishing red man had such a prophet within the past hundred years, the Shawnee Tenskwatawa, who predicted the eclipseof the sun in 1806 and denounced the vices of the white man. Many true teachers have appeared among the various tribes and races all through the long ages of evolutionary history. And they will ever continue to appear to challenge the shamans or priests of any age who oppose general education and attempt to thwart scientific progress. ([UB 90:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p2_9))

## _“undiscovered on Urantia”_

> The physical controllers are chiefly occupied in the adjustment of basic energies undiscovered on Urantia. These unknown energies are very essential to the interplanetary system of transport and to certain techniques of communication. When we lay lines of energy for the purpose of conveying sound equivalents or of extending vision, these undiscovered forms of energy are utilized by the living physical controllers and their associates. These same energies are also, on occasion, used by the midway creatures in their routine work. ([UB 29:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_14))

> Matter in all universes, excepting in the central universe, is identical. Matter in its physical properties depends on the revolutionary rates of its component members, the number and size of the revolving members, their distance from the nuclear body or the space content of matter, as well as on the presence of certain forces as yet undiscovered on Urantia. ([UB 42:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p3_1))

> Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, energy, and matter are—in origin, nature, and destiny—one and the same thing, together with other material realities as yet undiscovered on Urantia. ([UB 42:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_1))

> The mesotron explains certain cohesive properties of the atomic nucleus, but it does not account for the cohesion of proton to proton nor for the adhesion of neutron to neutron. The paradoxical and powerful force of atomic cohesive integrity is a form of energy as yet undiscovered on Urantia. ([UB 42:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p8_6))

## Additional use of _“undiscovered”_ with _“energy(ies)”_ in the same paragraph.

\[For additional noteworthy context, three paragraphs are included in this first entry.\]

> 5. _Explorers of Undirected Assignment_. When the reserve corps of the Solitary Messengers is overrecruited, there issues from one of the Seven Supreme Power Directors a call for exploration volunteers; and there is never a lack of volunteers, for they delight to be dispatched as free and untrammeled explorers, to experience the thrill of finding the organizing nucleuses of new worlds and universes.
> 
> They go forth to investigate the clues furnished by the space contemplators of the realms. Undoubtedly the Paradise Deities know of the existence of these undiscovered energy systems of space, but they never divulge such information. If the Solitary Messengers did not explore and chart these newly organizing energy centers, such phenomena would long remain unnoticed even by the intelligences of adjacent realms. Solitary Messengers, as a class, are highly sensitive to gravity; accordingly they can sometimes detect the probable presence of very small dark planets, the very worlds which are best adapted to life experiments.
> 
> These messenger-explorers of undirected assignment patrol the master universe. They are constantly out on exploring expeditions to the uncharted regions of all outer space. Very much of the information which we possess of transactions in the realms of outer space, we owe to the explorations of the Solitary Messengers as they often work and study with the celestial astronomers. ([UB 23:2.19-21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23#p2_19))

> The action of certain secondary and other undiscovered energies present in the space regions of your local universe is such that solar-light emanations appear to execute certain wavy phenomena as well as to be chopped up into infinitesimal portions of definite length and weight. And, practically considered, that is exactly what happens. You can hardly hope to arrive at a better understanding of the behavior of light until such a time as you acquire a clearer concept of the interaction and interrelationship of the various space-forces and solar energies operating in the space regions of Nebadon. Your present confusion is also due to your incomplete grasp of this problem as it involves the interassociated activities of the personal and nonpersonal control of the master universe—the presences, the performances, and the co-ordination of the Conjoint Actor and the Unqualified Absolute. ([UB 41:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p5_8))

> The savage is a slave to nature, but scientific civilization is slowly conferring increasing liberty on mankind. Through animals, fire, wind, water, electricity, and other undiscovered sources of energy, man has liberated, and will continue to liberate, himself from the necessity for unremitting toil. Regardless of the transient trouble produced by the prolific invention of machinery, the ultimate benefits to be derived from such mechanical inventions are inestimable. Civilization can never flourish, much less be established, until man has leisure to think, to plan, to imagine new and better ways of doing things. ([UB 81:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_14))

## The additional entries include:

> Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human wisdom must evolve. ([UB 101:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2))

> Human life consists in three great drives—urges, desires, and lures. Strong character, commanding personality, is only acquired by converting the natural urge of life into the social art of living, by transforming present desires into those higher longings which are capable of lasting attainment, while the commonplace lure of existence must be transferred from one’s conventional and established ideas to the higher realms of unexplored ideas and undiscovered ideals. ([UB 160:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_2))

> Social maturity is equivalent to the degree to which man is willing to surrender the gratification of mere transient and present desires for the entertainment of those superior longings the striving for whose attainment affords the more abundant satisfactions of progressive advancement toward permanent goals. But the true badge of social maturity is the willingness of a people to surrender the right to live peaceably and contentedly under the ease-promoting standards of the lure of established beliefs and conventional ideas for the disquieting and energy-requiring lure of the pursuit of the unexplored possibilities of the attainment of undiscovered goals of idealistic spiritual realities. ([UB 160:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_4))

> The social characteristics of a true religion consist in the fact that it invariably seeks to convert the individual and to transform the world. Religion implies the existence of undiscovered ideals which far transcend the known standards of ethics and morality embodied in even the highest social usages of the most mature institutions of civilization. Religion reaches out for undiscovered ideals, unexplored realities, superhuman values, divine wisdom, and true spirit attainment. True religion does all of this; all other beliefs are not worthy of the name. You cannot have a genuine spiritual religion without the supreme and supernal ideal of an eternal God. A religion without this God is an invention of man, a human institution of lifeless intellectual beliefs and meaningless emotional ceremonies. A religion might claim as the object of its devotion a great ideal. But such ideals of unreality are not attainable; such a concept is illusionary. The only ideals susceptible of human attainment are the divine realities of the infinite values resident in the spiritual fact of the eternal God. ([UB 160:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_5))
