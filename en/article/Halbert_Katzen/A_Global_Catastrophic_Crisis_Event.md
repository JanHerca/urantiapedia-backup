## Introduction

The next arrival of a divine Son could be triggered by a world crisis, the final adjudication of the Lucifer rebellion, or other circumstances. And we do not know how these events might directly combine, overlap, or show up in a close sequential arrangement.

Whether it’s the Bible or _The Urantia Book_, limitations on prophetic revelations are always at play. We get clues, not conclusions. We get more questions than answers. Hints of possibilities are scatter throughout both texts. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the questions clarifies the possibilities and sometimes leads to implications that are not readily apparent.

This study aid focuses on whether the next visitation of a divine Son will come in the context of a global catastrophic crisis event.

In the following paragraph, note how repeated references by Jesus to a world crisis is what creates the context for the question concerning his eventual return.

> Although Jesus referred one phase of the kingdom to the future and did, **on numerous occasions**, **intimate** that such an event might appear as a part of a world crisis; and though he did likewise most certainly, on several occasions, definitely promise sometime to return to Urantia, it should be recorded that he never positively linked these two ideas together. He promised a new revelation of the kingdom on earth and at some future time; he also promised sometime to come back to this world in person; but he did not say that these two events were synonymous. From all we know these promises may, or may not, refer to the same event. ([UB 170:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_15))

The first definition of _intimate_ is more commonly used. But the second one may be appropriate as well or instead, especially considering the source of the information and numerous references made by Jesus.

_intimate:_ transitive verb
1. to communicate delicately and indirectly : hint
2. to make known especially publicly or formally : announce

Plus, Jesus taught:

> “But what is the significance of this teaching having to do with the coming of the Sons of God? Do you not perceive that, when each of you is called to lay down his life struggle and pass through the portal of death, you stand in the immediate presence of judgment, and that you are face to face with the facts of a new dispensation of service in the eternal plan of the infinite Father? **What the whole world must face as a literal fact at the end of an age, you, as individuals, must each most certainly face as a personal experience when you reach the end of your natural life and thereby pass on to be confronted with the conditions and demands inherent in the next revelation of the eternal progression of the Father’s kingdom.”** ([UB 176:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_7))

Consider that the implication of Jesus’ teaching is that all of humanity is going to literally be faced with physical death at the end of this age, just as his immediate followers are going to have to face physical death. Does this imply that the next age will be one in which the whole world faces death as part of a planetary crisis?

The following five paragraphs are key to understanding this topic because they point out three prophecies that the revelators want us to take seriously. John, Isaiah, and Peter, respectively, use the phrase “a new heaven(s) and a new earth.” Plus, Isaiah’s reference to new moons and sabbath days corresponds well to the intersecting full solar eclipses (new moons) over Bald Knob Cross of Peace on Jesus’ birthday and the day between crucifixion and resurrection.

> It was of the conclusion of the terminal mission of the Teacher Sons (at least that would be the chronology on a normal world) that John wrote: “I saw a **new heaven and a new earth** and the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a princess adorned for the prince.”
> 
> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the **new heavens and the new earth**, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and **it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.”**
> 
> It is the mortals of such an age who are described as “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an exalted people; and you shall show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into this marvelous light.”
> 
> No matter what the special natural history of an individual planet may be, no difference whether a realm has been wholly loyal, tainted with evil, or cursed by sin—no matter what the antecedents may be—sooner or later the grace of God and the ministry of angels will usher in the day of the advent of the Trinity Teacher Sons; and their departure, following their final mission, will inaugurate this superb era of light and life.
> 
> All the worlds of Satania can join in the hope of the one who wrote: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a **new heaven and a new earth**, wherein dwells righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” ([UB 52:7.11-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_11))

Believing in prophecies is a notable test of faith for both Bible and _Urantia Book_ students.

## Personal Considerations

Consider that crisis events can even overlap. We could be in the middle of religious, political, social, and economic crises—tribution, if you will—and also be approaching a more sudden and dramatic crisis event, perhaps of an environmental nature within or beyond our control. Who knows?

What would it look like and what would be the value of standing up for _Urantia Book_ teachings in the midst of religious, social, and political crises that are at odds with _Urantia Book_ teachings?

What social and political trends are pushing the limits or overtly at odds with _Urantia Book_ teachings?

How do we live _Urantia Book_ teachings about religious, social, political, and scientific issues, as believers, without embroiling this revelation in such issues?

And what might all this mean to us as individuals?

> Jesus comprehended that he faced the immediate declaration of avowed and open warfare by his increasing enemies, and he elected boldly to assume the offensive. At the feeding of the five thousand he had challenged their ideas of the material Messiah; now he chose again openly to attack their concept of the Jewish deliverer. This crisis, which began with the feeding of the five thousand, and which terminated with this Sabbath afternoon sermon, was the outward turning of the tide of popular fame and acclaim. Henceforth, the work of the kingdom was to be increasingly concerned with the more important task of winning lasting spiritual converts for the truly religious brotherhood of mankind. This sermon marks the **crisis in the transition** from the period of discussion, controversy, and decision to that of open warfare and final acceptance or final rejection.
> 
> The Master well knew that many of his followers were slowly but surely preparing their minds finally to reject him. He likewise knew that many of his disciples were slowly but certainly passing through that training of mind and that discipline of soul which would enable them to triumph over doubt and courageously to assert their full-fledged faith in the gospel of the kingdom. Jesus fully understood how **men prepare themselves for the decisions of a crisis** and the performance of sudden deeds of courageous choosing by the slow process of the reiterated choosing between the recurring situations of good and evil. He subjected his chosen messengers to repeated rehearsals in disappointment and provided them with frequent and testing opportunities for choosing between the right and the wrong way of meeting spiritual trials. He knew he could depend on his followers, when they met the final test, to make their vital decisions in accordance with prior and habitual mental attitudes and spirit reactions. ([UB 153:1.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_2))

> Before Jesus was put on his cross, the two brigands had already been placed on their crosses, all the while cursing and spitting upon their executioners. Jesus’ only words, as they nailed him to the crossbeam, were, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” He could not have so mercifully and lovingly interceded for his executioners if such thoughts of affectionate devotion had not been the mainspring of all his life of unselfish service. **The ideas, motives, and longings of a lifetime are openly revealed in a crisis.** ([UB 187:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_4))

> Every ascendant mortal of insurrectionary experience who functions loyally in the face of rebellion is eventually destined to become a Mighty Messenger of the superuniverse service. Likewise is any ascendant creature who effectively prevents such upheavals of error, evil, or sin; for action designed to prevent rebellion or to effect higher types of **loyalty in a universe crisis** is regarded as of even greater value than loyalty in the face of actual rebellion. ([UB 22:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_3))

> The greatest affliction of the cosmos is never to have been afflicted. Mortals only learn wisdom by experiencing **tribulation**. ([UB 48:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_14))

## Translations of the Living vs. Resurrection of the Dead

### Historical considerations

#### Planetary Prince’s arrival

> 4. _Planetary-mortal epochs_. This classification recognizes the succession of temporal dispensations as they affect man’s terrestrial status and his reception of celestial ministry.
> 
> Life is initiated on the planets by the Life Carriers, who watch over its development until sometime after the evolutionary appearance of mortal man. Before the Life Carriers leave a planet, they duly install a Planetary Prince as ruler of the realm. With this ruler there arrives a full quota of subordinate auxiliaries and ministering helpers, and **the first adjudication of the living and the dead is simultaneous with his arrival.** ([UB 49:5.21-22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_21))

Note the implication that “adjudication of the living and the dead” is something that happens more than once. Note how Jesus reinforces this idea.

> “But what is the significance of this teaching having to do with the coming of the Sons of God? Do you not perceive that, when each of you is called to lay down his life struggle and pass through the portal of death, you stand in the immediate presence of judgment, and that you are face to face with the facts of a new dispensation of service in the eternal plan of the infinite Father? **What the whole world must face as a literal fact at the end of an age**, you, as individuals, must each most certainly face as a personal experience when you reach the end of your natural life and thereby pass on to be confronted with the conditions and demands inherent in the next revelation of the eternal progression of the Father’s kingdom.” ([UB 176:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_7))

When the Planetary Prince arrived people were guided by God, based on genetics, to the Prince’s location, so that they could be part of the process. If there is a planetary crisis, what genetic considerations may come into play and how would they be handled?

> Sometime before the arrival of these one hundred Jerusem citizens, the two supervising Life Carriers resident on Urantia, having previously perfected their plans, petitioned Jerusem and Edentia for permission to transplant the life plasm of one hundred selected survivors of the Andon and Fonta stock into the material bodies to be projected for the corporeal members of the Prince’s staff. The request was granted on Jerusem and approved on Edentia.
> 
> Accordingly, fifty males and fifty females of the Andon and Fonta posterity, representing the survival of the best strains of that unique race, were chosen by the Life Carriers. With one or two exceptions these Andonite contributors to the advancement of the race were strangers to one another. **They were assembled from widely separated places by co-ordinated Thought Adjuster direction and seraphic guidance at the threshold of the planetary headquarters of the Prince.** Here the one hundred human subjects were given into the hands of the highly skilled volunteer commission from Avalon, who directed the material extraction of a portion of the life plasm of these Andon descendants. This living material was then transferred to the material bodies constructed for the use of the one hundred Jerusemite members of the Prince’s staff. Meantime, these newly arrived citizens of the system capital were held in the sleep of seraphic transport. ([UB 66:2.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_6))

Could a world crisis precipitate an event where some salvable souls remain on (or are returned) to this planet, while others continue on the mansion worlds and/or some type of transition world?

> The prince’s corporeal staff are usually removed from the planet in connection with the next adjudication at the time of the second Son’s arrival on the sphere. Before leaving, they customarily assign their various duties to their mutual offspring and to certain superior native volunteers. On those worlds where these helpers of the prince have been permitted to mate with the superior groups of the native races, such offspring usually succeed them.
> 
> These assistants to the Planetary Prince seldom mate with the world races, but they do always mate among themselves. Two classes of beings result from these unions: the primary type of midway creatures and certain high types of material beings who remain attached to the prince’s staff after their parents have been removed from the planet at the time of the arrival of Adam and Eve. These children do not mate with the mortal races except in certain emergencies and then only by direction of the Planetary Prince. In such an event, their children—the grandchildren of the corporeal staff—are in status as of the superior races of their day and generation. All the offspring of these semimaterial assistants of the Planetary Prince are Adjuster indwelt.
> 
> At the end of the prince’s dispensation, when the time comes for this “reversion staff” to be returned to the system headquarters for the resumption of the Paradise career, these ascenders present themselves to the Life Carriers for the purpose of yielding up their material bodies. They enter the transition slumber and awaken delivered from their mortal investment and clothed with morontia forms, ready for seraphic transportation back to the system capital, where their detached Adjusters await them. They are a whole dispensation behind their Jerusem class, but they have gained a unique and extraordinary experience, a rare chapter in the career of an ascending mortal. ([UB 50:3.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_4))

#### Lucifer rebellion

> Of the many reasons known to me as to why Lucifer and his confederates were not sooner interned or adjudicated, I am permitted to recite the following: … ([UB 54:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p5_1))

> 9. On Jerusem the personal representative of the Supreme Executive of Orvonton counseled Gabriel to foster full opportunity for every living creature to mature a deliberate choice in those matters involved in the Lucifer Declaration of Liberty. The issues of rebellion having been raised, the Paradise **emergency adviser** of Gabriel portrayed that, if such full and free opportunity were not given all Norlatiadek creatures, then would the Paradise quarantine against all such possible halfhearted or doubt-stricken creatures be extended in self-protection against the entire constellation. To keep open the Paradise doors of ascension to the beings of Norlatiadek, it was necessary to provide for the full development of rebellion and to insure the complete determination of attitude on the part of all beings in any way concerned therewith. [UB 54:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p5_10)

> 11. An **emergency council** of ex-mortals consisting of Mighty Messengers, glorified mortals who had had personal experience with like situations, together with their colleagues, was organized on Jerusem. They advised Gabriel that at least three times the number of beings would be led astray if arbitrary or summary methods of suppression were attempted. The entire Uversa corps of counselors concurred in advising Gabriel to permit the rebellion to take its full and natural course, even if it should require a million years to wind up the consequences. [UB 54:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p5_12)

>  in adjudicating the Lucifer rebellion, we may record that, during the time of effecting this revelation, the first hearing in the pending case of Gabriel _vs._Lucifer was held on Uversa, and soon thereafter there issued the mandate of the Ancients of Days directing that Satan be henceforth confined to the prison world with Lucifer. This ends the ability of Satan to pay further visits to any of the fallen worlds of Satania. Justice in a mercy-dominated universe may be slow, but it is certain. ([UB 54:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_8))

Consider how the perspective above might affect the wisdom of the Most Highs, if the Most Highs can foresee a planetary evacuation event looming, perhaps even on April 8, 2024 … as prophesied?

> The outbreak of rebellion on Jerusem, the capital of Satania, was broadcast by the Melchizedek council. The **emergency Melchizedeks** were immediately dispatched to Jerusem, and Gabriel volunteered to act as the representative of the Creator Son, whose authority had been challenged. With this broadcast of the fact of rebellion in Satania the system was isolated, quarantined, from her sister systems. There was “war in heaven,” the headquarters of Satania, and it spread to every planet in the local system. ([UB 67:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_1))

> This seven years of waiting was a time of heart searching and soul discipline. Such **crises in the affairs of a universe** demonstrate the tremendous influence of mind as a factor in spiritual choosing. Education, training, and experience are factors in most of the vital decisions of all evolutionary moral creatures. But it is entirely possible for the indwelling spirit to make direct contact with the decision-determining powers of the human personality so as to empower the fully consecrated will of the creature to perform amazing acts of loyal devotion to the will and the way of the Father in Paradise. And this is just what occurred in the experience of Amadon, the modified human associate of Van. [UB 67:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_7)

> There is no end to the recital of the stirring events of these tragic days. But at last the final decision of the last personality was made, and then, but only then, did a Most High of Edentia arrive with the **emergency Melchizedeks to seize authority on Urantia**. The Caligastia panoramic reign-records on Jerusem were obliterated, and the probationary era of planetary rehabilitation was inaugurated. [UB 67:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_10)

> Before the arrival of the Melchizedek receivers, Van placed the administration of human affairs in the hands of ten commissions of four each, groups identical with those of the Prince’s regime. The senior resident Life Carriers assumed temporary leadership of this council of forty, which functioned throughout the seven years of waiting. Similar groups of Amadonites assumed these responsibilities when the thirty-nine loyal staff members returned to Jerusem.
> 
> These _Amadonites_ were derived from the group of 144 loyal Andonites to which Amadon belonged, and who have become known by his name. This group comprised thirty-nine men and one hundred and five women. **Fifty-six of this number were of immortality status, and all (except Amadon) were translated along with the loyal members of the staff.** The remainder of this noble band continued on earth to the end of their mortal days under the leadership of Van and Amadon. They were the biologic leaven which multiplied and continued to furnish leadership for the world down through the long dark ages of the postrebellion era. ([UB 67:6.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_2))

> Van and Amadon remained on earth until shortly after the arrival of Adam and Eve. **Some years thereafter they were translated to Jerusem, where Van was reunited with his waiting Adjuster.** Van now serves in behalf of Urantia while awaiting the order to go forward on the long, long trail to Paradise perfection and the unrevealed destiny of the assembling Corps of Mortal Finality. [UB 67:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_8)

#### Adamic default

> The Edenic caravan was halted on the third day out from the Garden by the arrival of the seraphic transports from Jerusem. And for the first time Adam and Eve were informed of what was to become of their children. **While the transports stood by, those children who had arrived at the age of choice (twenty years) were given the option of remaining on Urantia with their parents or of becoming wards of the Most Highs of Norlatiadek.** Two thirds chose to go to Edentia; about one third elected to remain with their parents. **All children of prechoice age were taken to Edentia.** No one could have beheld the sorrowful parting of this Material Son and Daughter and their children without realizing that the way of the transgressor is hard. **These offspring of Adam and Eve are now on Edentia; we do not know what disposition is to be made of them.** [UB 75:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p6_3)

> They did not long rest in the oblivion of the unconscious sleep of the mortals of the realm. On the third day after Adam’s death, the second following his reverent burial, the orders of Lanaforge, sustained by the acting Most High of Edentia and concurred in by the Union of Days on Salvington, acting for Michael, were placed in Gabriel’s hands, directing the special roll call of the distinguished survivors of the Adamic default on Urantia. And in accordance with this mandate of special resurrection, number twenty-six of the Urantia series, Adam and Eve were repersonalized and reassembled in the resurrection halls of the mansion worlds of Satania together with 1,316 of their associates in the experience of the first garden. **Many other loyal souls had already been translated at the time of Adam’s arrival, which was attended by a dispensational adjudication of both the sleeping survivors and of the living qualified ascenders**. [UB 76:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_2)

#### Jesus’ incarnation

> … It was said of Christ Michael that, when he ascended on high at the conclusion of his work on earth, “He led a great multitude of captives.” And these captives were the sleeping survivors from the days of Adam to the day of the Master’s resurrection on Urantia.
> 
> The passing of time is of no moment to sleeping mortals; they are wholly unconscious and oblivious to the length of their rest. On reassembly of personality at the end of an age, those who have slept five thousand years will react no differently than those who have rested five days. **Aside from this time delay these survivors pass on through the ascension regime identically with those who avoid the longer or shorter sleep of death.** ([UB 30:4.11-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_11))

Note that Jesus’ bestowal did not instigate a resurrection of the living, but this occasion for commentary about Jesus’ bestowal was also used to remind readers that some people “avoid the longer or shorter sleep of death.”

### General practices

#### Mortal experience

> The Adjuster-indwelt children and youths on the finaliter world are also reared in families of five, ranging in ages from six to fourteen; approximately, these families consist of children whose ages are six, eight, ten, twelve, and fourteen. Any time after sixteen, if final choice has been made, they translate to the first mansion world and begin their Paradise ascent. Some make a choice before this age and go on to the ascension spheres, but very few children under sixteen years of age, as reckoned by Urantia standards, will be found on the mansion worlds. ([UB 47:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_5))

> When material life has run its course, if no choice has been made for the ascendant life, or if these children of time definitely decide against the Havona adventure, death automatically terminates their probationary careers. There is no adjudication of such cases; there is no resurrection from such a second death. They simply become as though they had not been.
> 
> But if they choose the Paradise path of perfection, they are immediately made ready for translation to the first mansion world, where many of them arrive in time to join their parents in the Havona ascent. After passing through Havona and attaining the Deities, these salvaged souls of mortal origin constitute the permanent ascendant citizenship of Paradise. These children who have been deprived of the valuable and essential evolutionary experience on the worlds of mortal nativity are not mustered into the Corps of the Finality. [UB 47:2.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_7)

#### Midwayers

> Although deprived of the immediate benefits of the planetary bestowals of the descending Sons of God, though the Paradise ascent is long deferred, nevertheless, soon after an evolutionary planet has attained the intermediate epochs of light and life (if not before), both groups of midway creatures are released from planetary duty. **Sometimes the majority of them are translated, along with their human cousins, on the day of the descent of the temple of light and the elevation of the Planetary Prince to the dignity of Planetary Sovereign.** Upon being relieved of planetary service, both orders are registered in the local universe as ascending Sons of God and immediately begin the long Paradise ascent by the very routes ordained for the progression of the mortal races of the material worlds. The primary group are destined to various finaliter corps, but the secondary or Adamic midwayers are all routed for enrollment in the Mortal Corps of Finality. ([UB 40:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p3_1))

## Current Planetary Crisis

### Worldwide spread of revelatory teachings

> And this is the long story of the teachings of Machiventa Melchizedek on Urantia. It is nearly four thousand years since this **emergency Son** of Nebadon bestowed himself on Urantia, and in that time the teachings of the “priest of El Elyon, the Most High God,” have penetrated to all races and peoples. And Machiventa was successful in achieving the purpose of his unusual bestowal; when Michael made ready to appear on Urantia, the God concept was existent in the hearts of men and women, the same God concept that still flames anew in the living spiritual experience of the manifold children of the Universal Father as they live their intriguing temporal lives on the whirling planets of space. ([UB 98:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p7_12))

> … Jesus told Ganid about the translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek at this place. And they discussed again and again all the religions of the world, Jesus endeavoring to point out to this young mind the truth in each, always adding: “But Yahweh is the God developed from the revelations of Melchizedek and the covenant of Abraham. The Jews were the offspring of Abraham and subsequently occupied the very land wherein Melchizedek had lived and taught, and from which he sent teachers to all the world; and their religion eventually portrayed a clearer recognition of the Lord God of Israel as the Universal Father in heaven than any other world religion.” ([UB 130:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p3_4))

> The evolution and elevation of the Mosaic teaching has influenced almost one half of all the world, and still does even in the twentieth century. While Moses comprehended the more advanced Egyptian religious philosophy, the Bedouin slaves knew little about such teachings, but they had never entirely forgotten the god of Mount Horeb, whom their ancestors had called Yahweh. ([UB 96:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p4_1))

> In following Jesus, literally and figuratively, he \[Peter\] was either leading the procession or else trailing behind—”following afar off.” But he was the outstanding preacher of the twelve; he did more than any other one man, aside from Paul, to establish the kingdom and send its messengers to the four corners of the earth in one generation. ([UB 139:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_9))

> The Christian religion, as a Urantian system of belief, arose through the compounding of the following teachings, influences, beliefs, cults, and personal individual attitudes:
> 
> 1. The Melchizedek teachings, which are a basic factor in all the religions of Occident and Orient that have arisen in the last four thousand years. ([UB 98:7.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p7_3))

### Materialistic tendencies

> Religion is now confronted by the challenge of a new age of scientific minds and materialistic tendencies. In this gigantic struggle between the secular and the spiritual, the religion of Jesus will eventually triumph. ([UB 195:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_5))

> Scientists have unintentionally precipitated mankind into a materialistic panic; they have started an unthinking run on the moral bank of the ages, but this bank of human experience has vast spiritual resources; it can stand the demands being made upon it. Only unthinking men become panicky about the spiritual assets of the human race. When the materialistic-secular panic is over, the religion of Jesus will not be found bankrupt. The spiritual bank of the kingdom of heaven will be paying out faith, hope, and moral security to all who draw upon it “in His name.” ([UB 195:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_1))

> At the time of this writing the **worst of the materialistic age is over**; the day of a better understanding is already beginning to dawn. The higher minds of the scientific world are no longer wholly materialistic in their philosophy, but the rank and file of the people still lean in that direction as a result of former teachings. But this age of physical realism is only a passing episode in man’s life on earth. Modern science has left true religion—the teachings of Jesus as translated in the lives of his believers—untouched. All science has done is to destroy the childlike illusions of the misinterpretations of life. ([UB 195:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4))

Consider the paragraph above along with this declaration by Jesus:

> “And now concerning the travail of Jerusalem, about which I have spoken to you, even this generation will not pass away until my words are fulfilled; but concerning the times of the coming again of the Son of Man, no one in heaven or on earth may presume to speak. But you should be wise regarding the ripening of an age; you should be alert to discern the signs of the times. You know when the fig tree shows its tender branches and puts forth its leaves that summer is near. Likewise, **when the world has passed through the long winter of material-mindedness and you discern the coming of the spiritual springtime of a new dispensation, should you know that the summertime of a new visitation draws near**.” ([UB 176:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_6))

### Problems with the worldwide spread of revelatory teachings

> Here and there throughout Arabia were families and clans that held on to the hazy idea of the one God. Such groups treasured the traditions of Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, and Zoroaster. There were numerous centers that might have responded to the Jesusonian gospel, but the Christian missionaries of the desert lands were an austere and unyielding group in contrast with the compromisers and innovators who functioned as missionaries in the Mediterranean countries. **Had the followers of Jesus taken more seriously his injunction to “go into all the world and preach the gospel,” and had they been more gracious in that preaching, less stringent in collateral social requirements of their own devising, then many lands would gladly have received the simple gospel of the carpenter’s son, Arabia among them.** ([UB 95:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_3))

> These various groupings of Christians may serve to accommodate numerous different types of would-be believers among the various peoples of Western civilization, but such division of Christendom presents a grave weakness when it attempts to carry the gospel of Jesus to Oriental peoples. These races do not yet understand that there is a _religion of Jesus_ separate, and somewhat apart, from Christianity, which has more and more become a _religion about Jesus._ ([UB 195:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_15))

> Christianity is seriously confronted with the doom embodied in one of its own slogans: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” The non-Christian world will hardly capitulate to a sect-divided Christendom. The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true church—the Jesus brotherhood—is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by _unity,_ not necessarily by _uniformity._ Uniformity is the earmark of the physical world of mechanistic nature. Spiritual unity is the fruit of faith union with the living Jesus. The visible church should refuse longer to handicap the progress of the invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the kingdom of God. And this brotherhood is destined to become a _living organism_ in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them. ([UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11))

> Do not overlook the value of your spiritual heritage, the river of truth running down through the centuries, even to the barren times of a materialistic and secular age. In all your worthy efforts to rid yourselves of the superstitious creeds of past ages, make sure that you hold fast the eternal truth. But be patient! when the present superstition revolt is over, the truths of Jesus’ gospel will persist gloriously to illuminate a new and better way. ([UB 195:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_1))

> But paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack of a new vision of the Master’s life on earth. A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment. ([UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

Consider that _Urantia Book_ culture has also become sect divided as a consequence of the failure to preserve the original organizational relationship between Urantia Foundation and Urantia Brotherhood. Consider the [Unity Treatise](https://ubannotated.com/main-menu/animated/topical-studies/prophecy-and-signs-of-the-times/#unity) as an expression of the seriousness of this problem and how the cutoff date for restoring the relationship is the date of the first full solar eclipse over Bald Knob Cross of Peace.

> As the original teachings of Jesus penetrated the Occident, they became Occidentalized, and as they became Occidentalized, they began to lose their potentially universal appeal to all races and kinds of men. **Christianity, today, has become a religion well adapted to the social, economic, and political mores of the white races. It has long since ceased to be the religion of Jesus**, although it still valiantly portrays a beautiful religion about Jesus to such individuals as sincerely seek to follow in the way of its teaching. It has glorified Jesus as the Christ, the Messianic anointed one from God, but has largely forgotten the Master’s personal gospel: the Fatherhood of God and the universal brotherhood of all men. ([UB 98:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p7_11))

> Christianity exhibits a history of having originated out of the unintended transformation of the religion of Jesus into a religion about Jesus. It further presents the history of having experienced Hellenization, paganization, secularization, institutionalization, intellectual deterioration, spiritual decadence, moral hibernation, threatened extinction, later rejuvenation, fragmentation, and more recent relative rehabilitation. Such a pedigree is indicative of inherent vitality and the possession of vast recuperative resources. And this same Christianity is now present in the civilized world of Occidental peoples and stands face to face with a struggle for existence which is **even more ominous than those eventful crises which have characterized its past battles for dominance**. ([UB 195:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_4))

>  Christianity suffers under a great handicap because it has become identified in the minds of all the world as a part of the social system, the industrial life, and the moral standards of Western civilization; and **thus has Christianity unwittingly seemed to sponsor a society which staggers under the guilt of tolerating science without idealism, politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without restraint, knowledge without character, power without conscience, and industry without morality.** ([UB 195:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_20))

> Institutional religion cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction. Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in **the present crisis of civilization**. ([UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1))

> The manifestations associated with the bestowal of the “new teacher,” and the reception of the apostles’ preaching by the men of various races and nations gathered together at Jerusalem, indicate the universality of the religion of Jesus. The gospel of the kingdom was to be identified with no particular race, culture, or language. This day of Pentecost witnessed the great effort of the spirit to liberate the religion of Jesus from its inherited Jewish fetters. Even after this demonstration of pouring out the spirit upon all flesh, the apostles at first endeavored to impose the requirements of Judaism upon their converts. Even Paul had trouble with his Jerusalem brethren because he refused to subject the gentiles to these Jewish practices. **No revealed religion can spread to all the world when it makes the serious mistake of becoming permeated with some national culture or associated with established racial, social, or economic practices.** ([UB 194:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_9))

> At the time of this revelation, the prevailing intellectual and philosophical climate of both European and American life is decidedly secular—humanistic. For three hundred years Western thinking has been progressively secularized. Religion has become more and more a nominal influence, largely a ritualistic exercise. **The majority of professed Christians of Western civilization are unwittingly actual secularists.** ([UB 195:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_3))

> Materialism denies God, secularism simply ignores him; at least that was the earlier attitude. More recently, secularism has assumed a more militant attitude, assuming to take the place of the religion whose totalitarian bondage it onetime resisted. Twentieth-century secularism tends to affirm that man does not need God. **But beware! this godless philosophy of human society will lead only to unrest, animosity, unhappiness, war, and world-wide disaster.** [UB 195:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_5)

How do we square the above teaching with the nature of this epochal revelation? What is the difference between spreading the simple gospel message vs. _The Urantia Book_, when it comes to cultural identifications?

> Vanity contributed mightily to the birth of society; but at the time of these revelations, the devious strivings of a vainglorious generation threaten to **swamp** and submerge the whole complicated structure of a highly specialized civilization. Pleasure-want has long since superseded hunger-want; the legitimate social aims of self-maintenance are rapidly translating themselves into base and threatening forms of self-gratification. Self-maintenance builds society; unbridled self-gratification unfailingly destroys civilization. ([UB 68:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_11))

> So-called Christianity has become a social and cultural movement as well as a religious belief and practice. The stream of modern Christianity drains many an ancient pagan **swamp** and many a barbarian morass; many olden cultural watersheds drain into this present-day cultural stream as well as the high Galilean tablelands which are supposed to be its exclusive source. ([UB 195:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_11))

### Crisis Administration

> When the planetary Vorondadek observer of Urantia—the Most High custodian who **not long since assumed an emergency regency of your world**—asserted his authority in the presence of the resident governor general, **he began his emergency administration of Urantia** with a full staff of his own choosing. He immediately assigned to all his associates and assistants their planetary duties. But he did not choose the three Personalized Adjusters who appeared in his presence the instant he assumed the regency. He did not even know they would thus appear, for they did not so manifest their divine presence at the time of a previous regency. And the Most High regent did not assign service or designate duties for these volunteer Personalized Adjusters. Nevertheless, these three omnipersonal beings were among the most active of the numerous orders of celestial beings then serving on Urantia. ([UB 109:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p7_7))

> **In a crisis** the actual and sovereign head of the government, excepting in certain purely spiritual matters, would be this Vorondadek Son of Edentia now on observation duty. (In these exclusively spiritual problems and in certain purely personal matters, the supreme authority seems to be vested in the commanding archangel attached to the divisional headquarters of that order which was recently established on Urantia.)
> 
> A Most High observer is empowered, at his discretion, to seize the planetary government in times of **grave planetary crises**, and it is of record that this has happened thirty-three times in the history of Urantia. At such times the Most High observer functions as the Most High regent, exercising unquestioned authority over all ministers and administrators resident on the planet excepting only the divisional organization of the archangels. ([UB 114:4.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_3))

Paper 43: The Constellations; Section 5. The Edentia Fathers since the Lucifer Rebellion

> The rotation of the Most Highs on Edentia was suspended at the time of the Lucifer rebellion. We now have the same rulers who were on duty at that time. We infer that no change in these rulers will be made until Lucifer and his associates are finally disposed of.
> 
> The present government of the constellation, however, has been expanded to include twelve Sons of the Vorondadek order. These twelve are as follows: … ([UB 43:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p5_1))

> 8. The Most High emergency administrator, the Vorondadek Son charged with the task of adapting the **emergency enactments** of the Norlatiadek legislature to the rebellion-isolated worlds of Satania.
>
> . . .
>
> 10. The Most High judge-advocate, the head of the **emergency tribunal** devoted to the adjustment of the special problems of Norlatiadek growing out of the confusion consequent upon the Satania rebellion.
>
> 12. The Most High director, the president of the **emergency council** of Edentia. All personalities assigned to Norlatiadek because of the Satania upheaval constitute the emergency council, and their presiding officer is a Vorondadek Son of extraordinary experience. [UB 43:5.10-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p5_10)

### Archangels

Best to review the whole section, [37.3: The Archangels](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3).

> The circuit of the archangels then operated for the first time from Urantia. Gabriel and the archangel hosts moved to the place of the spiritual polarity of the planet; and when Gabriel gave the signal, there flashed to the first of the system mansion worlds the voice of Gabriel, saying: “By the mandate of Michael, let the dead of a Urantia dispensation rise!” Then all the survivors of the human races of Urantia who had fallen asleep since the days of Adam, and who had not already gone on to judgment, appeared in the resurrection halls of mansonia in readiness for morontia investiture. And in an instant of time the seraphim and their associates made ready to depart for the mansion worlds. Ordinarily these seraphic guardians, onetime assigned to the group custody of these surviving mortals, would have been present at the moment of their awaking in the resurrection halls of mansonia, but they were on this world itself at this time because of the necessity of Gabriel’s presence here in connection with the morontia resurrection of Jesus. ([UB 189:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_2))

> Urantia is not without proper and effective supervision from the system, constellation, and universe rulers. But the planetary government is unlike that of any other world in the Satania system, even in all Nebadon. This uniqueness in your plan of supervision is due to a number of unusual circumstances:
> 
> 1. The life modification status of Urantia.
> 2. The exigencies of the Lucifer rebellion.
> 3. The disruptions of the Adamic default.
> 4. The irregularities growing out of the fact that Urantia was one of the bestowal worlds of the Universe Sovereign. Michael of Nebadon is the Planetary Prince of Urantia.
> 5. The special function of the twenty-four planetary directors.
> 6. The location on the planet of an archangels’ circuit.
> 7. The more recent designation of the onetime incarnated Machiventa Melchizedek as vicegerent Planetary Prince. ([UB 114:0.4-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_4))

> This rather loosely organized and somewhat personally administered planetary government is more than expectedly effective because of the **timesaving assistance of the archangels and their ever-ready circuit, which is so frequently utilized in planetary emergencies and administrative difficulties**. Technically, the planet is still spiritually isolated in the Norlatiadek circuits, but in an emergency this handicap can now be circumvented through utilization of the archangels’ circuit. **Planetary isolation is, of course, of little concern to individual mortals since the pouring out of the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh nineteen hundred years ago.** ([UB 114:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_4))

Note that “planetary isolation” is “of little concern” vs. the absence of incarnate rulers, by comparison.

### Reserve Corps

> Mortals of the realm are chosen for service in the reserve corps of destiny on the inhabited worlds because of: …
>
> 1. Special capacity for being **secretly rehearsed for numerous possible emergency missions** in the conduct of various activities of world affairs.
>
> . . .
>
> 3. The possession of a Thought Adjuster of extraordinary versatility and probable pre-Urantia experience in coping with planetary difficulties and **contending with impending world emergency situations**.
>
> . . .
>
> The twelve groups of Urantia destiny reservists are composed of mortal inhabitants of the sphere who have been rehearsed for numerous crucial positions on earth and are **held in readiness to act in possible planetary emergencies**. This combined corps now consists of 962 persons. The smallest corps numbers 41 and the largest 172. With the exception of less than a score of contact personalities, the members of this unique group are wholly unconscious of their **preparation for possible function in certain planetary crises**. These mortal reservists are chosen by the corps to which they are respectively attached and are likewise trained and rehearsed in the deep mind by the combined technique of Thought Adjuster and seraphic guardian ministry. Many times numerous other celestial personalities participate in this unconscious training, and in all this special preparation the midwayers perform valuable and indispensable services.
>
> On many worlds the better adapted secondary midway creatures are able to attain varying degrees of contact with the Thought Adjusters of certain favorably constituted mortals through the skillful penetration of the minds of the latters’ indwelling. (And it was by just such a fortuitous combination of cosmic adjustments that these revelations were materialized in the English language on Urantia.) Such potential contact mortals of the evolutionary worlds are mobilized in the numerous reserve corps, and it is, to a certain extent, through these small groups of forward-looking personalities that spiritual civilization is advanced and the Most Highs are able to rule in the kingdoms of men. The men and women of these reserve corps of destiny thus have various degrees of contact with their Adjusters through the intervening ministry of the midway creatures; but these same mortals are little known to their fellows except in those **rare social emergencies and spiritual exigencies wherein these reserve personalities function for the prevention of the breakdown of evolutionary culture or the extinction of the light of living truth.** On Urantia these reservists of destiny have seldom been emblazoned on the pages of human history. [UB 114:7.3-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_3)

## Future Possibilities

### For Urantians

> This world has never seriously or sincerely or honestly tried out these dynamic ideas and divine ideals of Jesus’ doctrine of the kingdom of heaven. But you should not become discouraged by the apparently slow progress of the kingdom idea on Urantia. **Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes in both the material and the spiritual worlds.** The bestowal of Jesus as an incarnated Son was just such a strange and unexpected event in the spiritual life of the world. Neither make the fatal mistake, in looking for the age manifestation of the kingdom, of failing to effect its establishment within your own souls. [UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14)

> “But what is the significance of this teaching having to do with the coming of the Sons of God? Do you not perceive that, when each of you is called to lay down his life struggle and pass through the portal of death, you stand in the immediate presence of judgment, and that you are face to face with the facts of a new dispensation of service in the eternal plan of the infinite Father? **What the whole world must face as a literal fact at the end of an age, you, as individuals, must each most certainly face as a personal experience when you reach the end of your natural life and thereby pass on to be confronted with the conditions and demands inherent in the next revelation of the eternal progression of the Father’s kingdom.”** ([UB 176:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_7))

Consider that the implication of Jesus’ teaching is that all of humanity is going to literally be faced with physical death at the end of this age, just as his immediate followers are going to have to face physical death. Does this imply that the next age will be one in which the whole world faces death as part of a planetary crisis?

> While there is this dematerializing technique for preparing the Adams for transit from Jerusem to the evolutionary worlds, there is no equivalent method for taking them away from such worlds unless the entire planet is to be emptied, in which event **emergency installation of the dematerialization technique** **is made for the entire** **salvable** **population. If some physical catastrophe should doom the planetary residence** of an evolving race, the Melchizedeks and the Life Carriers would install the technique of dematerialization for all survivors, and by seraphic transport these beings would be carried away to the new world prepared for their continuing existence. The evolution of a human race, once initiated on a world of space, must proceed quite independently of the physical survival of that planet, but during the evolutionary ages it is not otherwise intended that a Planetary Adam or Eve shall leave their chosen world. ([UB 51:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_3))

If everyone needs sufficient time to make a choice and our world faces an environmental crisis that would require evacuation and Jesus has promised to return and the prophets say there will be a new earth, what does this imply for possibilities?

If the world ends up collectively facing an event that would require evacuation of the planet, how much would this accelerate issues of personal growth and final choice and how much would this be based on age?

Would there be a probationary place set up for those who have not had time to make a final choice?

Would the intensity of the circumstances accelerate the growth of the most faithful, so that they would be able to return to the “new earth?”

> How futile to make puerile appeals to such a God to modify his changeless decrees so that we can avoid the just consequences of the operation of his wise natural laws and righteous spiritual mandates! “Be not deceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap.” True, even in the justice of reaping the harvest of wrongdoing, this divine justice is always tempered with mercy. Infinite wisdom is the eternal arbiter which determines the proportions of justice and mercy which shall be meted out in any given circumstance. The greatest punishment (in reality an inevitable consequence) for wrongdoing and deliberate rebellion against the government of God is loss of existence as an individual subject of that government. The final result of wholehearted sin is annihilation. In the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity. The factual disappearance of such a creature is, however, always delayed until the ordained order of justice current in that universe has been fully complied with.
> 
> Cessation of existence is **usually** decreed at the dispensational or epochal adjudication of the realm or realms. On a world such as Urantia it comes at the end of a planetary dispensation. Cessation of existence can be decreed at such times by co-ordinate action of all tribunals of jurisdiction, extending from the planetary council up through the courts of the Creator Son to the judgment tribunals of the Ancients of Days. The mandate of dissolution originates in the higher courts of the superuniverse following an unbroken confirmation of the **indictment originating on the sphere of the wrongdoer’s residence**; and then, when sentence of extinction has been confirmed on high, the execution is by the direct act of those judges residential on, and operating from, the headquarters of the superuniverse.
> When this sentence is finally confirmed, the sin-identified being instantly becomes as though he had not been. There is no resurrection from such a fate; it is everlasting and eternal. The living energy factors of identity are resolved by the transformations of time and the metamorphoses of space into the cosmic potentials whence they once emerged. As for the personality of the iniquitous one, it is deprived of a continuing life vehicle by the creature’s failure to make those choices and final decisions which would have assured eternal life. When the continued embrace of sin by the associated mind culminates in complete self-identification with iniquity, then upon the cessation of life, upon cosmic dissolution, such an isolated personality is absorbed into the oversoul of creation, becoming a part of the evolving experience of the Supreme Being. Never again does it appear as a personality; its identity becomes as though it had never been. In the case of an Adjuster-indwelt personality, the experiential spirit values survive in the reality of the continuing Adjuster. ([UB 2:3.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p3_2))

> Thus are the sleeping survivors of a planetary age repersonalized in the dispensational roll calls. But with regard to the nonsalvable personalities of a realm, no immortal spirit is present to function with the group guardians of destiny, and this constitutes cessation of creature existence. While some of your records have pictured these events as taking place on the planets of mortal death, they all really occur on the mansion worlds. ([UB 49:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_7))

> 3. _Mortals of the probationary-dependent orders of ascension._ The arrival of an Adjuster constitutes identity in the eyes of the universe, and all indwelt beings are on the roll calls of justice. But temporal life on the evolutionary worlds is uncertain, and many die in youth before choosing the Paradise career. Such Adjuster-indwelt children and youths follow the parent of most advanced spiritual status, thus going to the system finaliter world (the probationary nursery) on the third day, at a special resurrection, or at the regular millennial and dispensational roll calls. [UB 49:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_11)

> Children who die when too young to have Thought Adjusters are repersonalized on the finaliter world of the local systems concomitant with the arrival of either parent on the mansion worlds. A child acquires physical entity at mortal birth, but in the matter of survival all Adjusterless children are reckoned as still attached to their parents.
> 
> In due course Thought Adjusters come to indwell these little ones, while the seraphic ministry to both groups of the probationary-dependent orders of survival is in general similar to that of the more advanced parent or is equivalent to that of the parent in case only one survives. Those attaining the third circle, regardless of the status of their parents, are accorded personal guardians. ([UB 49:6.12-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_12))

> The Memory of Mercy must show that the saving credit established by the Sons of God has been fully and faithfully paid out in the loving ministry of the patient personalities of the Third Source and Center. But when mercy is exhausted, when the “memory” thereof testifies to its depletion, then does justice prevail and righteousness decree. For mercy is not to be thrust upon those who despise it; mercy is not a gift to be trampled under foot by the persistent rebels of time. Nevertheless, though mercy is thus precious and dearly bestowed, your individual drawing credits are always far in excess of your ability to exhaust the reserve if you are sincere of purpose and honest of heart. ([UB 28:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_7))

### Replacements and returns

> And all these speculations associated with the certainty of future appearances of both Magisterial and Trinity Teacher Sons, in conjunction with the explicit promise of the Creator Son to return sometime, make Urantia a planet of future uncertainty and render it one of the most interesting and intriguing spheres in all the universe of Nebadon. It is altogether possible that, in some future age when Urantia is approaching the era of light and life, after the affairs of the Lucifer rebellion and the Caligastia secession have been finally adjudicated, we may witness the presence on Urantia, simultaneously, of Machiventa, Adam, Eve, and Christ Michael, as well as either a Magisterial Son or even Trinity Teacher Sons. ([UB 93:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_8))

#### Adamic

> When such an era is attained on your world, no doubt Machiventa Melchizedek, now the vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia, will occupy the seat of the Planetary Sovereign; and it has long been conjectured on Jerusem that he will be accompanied by a son and daughter of the Urantia Adam and Eve who are now held on Edentia as wards of the Most Highs of Norlatiadek. **These children of Adam might so serve on Urantia in association with the Melchizedek-Sovereign since they were deprived of procreative powers almost 37,000 years ago at the time they gave up their material bodies on Urantia in preparation for transit to Edentia.** ([UB 55:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p7_3))

> The physical members of the Prince’s staff had been constituted sex creatures for the purpose of participating in the plan of procreating offspring embodying the combined qualities of their special order united with those of the selected stock of the Andon tribes, and all of this was in anticipation of the subsequent appearance of Adam. **The Life Carriers had planned a new type of mortal embracing the union of the conjoint offspring of the Prince’s staff with the first-generation offspring of Adam and Eve. They had thus projected a plan envisioning a new order of planetary creatures whom they hoped would become the teacher-rulers of human society. Such beings were designed for social sovereignty, not civil sovereignty. But since this project almost completely miscarried, we shall never know what an aristocracy of benign leadership and matchless culture Urantia was thus deprived of.** For when the corporeal staff later reproduced, it was subsequent to the rebellion and after they had been deprived of their connection with the life currents of the system. ([UB 77:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_2))

Consider how valuable to humanity a reconstitution of this plan would be in the context of a crisis and how restorative the justice would be for the children of Adam and Eve.

#### Machiventa Melchizedek

> As his was an **emergency bestowal** on Urantia, it does not appear from the records what Machiventa’s future may be. It may develop that the Melchizedek corps of Nebadon have sustained the permanent loss of one of their number. Recent rulings handed down from the Most Highs of Edentia, and later confirmed by the Ancients of Days of Uversa, strongly suggest that this bestowal Melchizedek is destined to take the place of the fallen Planetary Prince, Caligastia. If our conjectures in this respect are correct, it is altogether possible that Machiventa Melchizedek may again appear in person on Urantia and in some modified manner resume the role of the dethroned Planetary Prince, or else appear on earth to function as vicegerent Planetary Prince representing Christ Michael, who now actually holds the title of Planetary Prince of Urantia. While it is far from clear to us as to what Machiventa’s destiny may be, nevertheless, events which have so recently taken place strongly suggest that the foregoing conjectures are probably not far from the truth. ([UB 93:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_6))

#### Jesus as Michael

> In further answer to Peter’s question, Jesus said: “Why do you still look for the Son of Man to sit upon the throne of David and expect that the material dreams of the Jews will be fulfilled? Have I not told you all these years that my kingdom is not of this world? The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new beginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples. And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an enlarged revelation of truth and an enhanced demonstration of righteousness, even as he has already bestowed upon this world him who became the prince of darkness, and then Adam, who was followed by Melchizedek, and in these days, the Son of Man. And so will my Father continue to manifest his mercy and show forth his love, even to this dark and evil world. So also will I, after my Father has invested me with all power and authority, continue to follow your fortunes and to guide in the affairs of the kingdom by the presence of my spirit, who shall shortly be poured out upon all flesh. Even though I shall thus be present with you in spirit, I also promise that I will sometime return to this world, where I have lived this life in the flesh and achieved the experience of simultaneously revealing God to man and leading man to God. Very soon must I leave you and take up the work the Father has intrusted to my hands, but be of good courage, for I will sometime return. In the meantime, my Spirit of the Truth of a universe shall comfort and guide you.
>
> “You behold me now in weakness and in the flesh, but when I return, it shall be with power and in the spirit. The eye of flesh beholds the Son of Man in the flesh, but only the eye of the spirit will behold the Son of Man glorified by the Father and appearing on earth in his own name.
>
> “But the times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise; not even the angels of heaven know when this will occur. However, you should understand that, when this gospel of the kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the world for the salvation of all peoples, and when the fullness of the age has come to pass, the Father will send you another dispensational bestowal, **or else the Son of Man will return to adjudge the age**. ([UB 176:2.3-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3))

Consider how well the bolded section above works with the implications of a world crisis that requires evacuation.

> “And now concerning the travail of Jerusalem, about which I have spoken to you, even this generation will not pass away until my words are fulfilled; but **concerning the times of the coming again of the Son of Man, no one in heaven or on earth may presume to speak**. But you should be wise regarding the ripening of an age; you should be alert to discern the signs of the times. You know when the fig tree shows its tender branches and puts forth its leaves that summer is near. Likewise, when the world has passed through the long winter of material-mindedness and you discern the coming of the spiritual springtime of a new dispensation, should you know that the summertime of a new visitation draws near. [UB 176:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_6)

Even though it is not right for us to say when Jesus will return, does this mean we should feel restricted when it comes to thinking about and discussing how an planetary evacuation event might have some “meet your Maker” aspects to it?

> Jesus promised to do two things after he had ascended to the Father, and after all power in heaven and on earth had been placed in his hands. He promised, first, to send into the world, and in his stead, another teacher, the Spirit of Truth; and this he did on the day of Pentecost. Second, he most certainly promised his followers that he would sometime personally return to this world. But he did not say how, where, or when he would revisit this planet of his bestowal experience in the flesh. On one occasion he intimated that, whereas the eye of flesh had beheld him when he lived here in the flesh, on his return (at least on one of his possible visits) he would be discerned only by the eye of spiritual faith.
>
> Many of us are inclined to believe that Jesus will return to Urantia many times during the ages to come. We do not have his specific promise to make these plural visits, but it seems most probable that he who carries among his universe titles that of Planetary Prince of Urantia will many times visit the world whose conquest conferred such a unique title upon him.
> 
> We most positively believe that Michael will again come in person to Urantia, but we have not the slightest idea as to when or in what manner he may choose to come. Will his second advent on earth be timed to occur in connection with the terminal judgment of this present age, either with or without the associated appearance of a Magisterial Son? Will he come in connection with the termination of some subsequent Urantian age? Will he come unannounced and as an isolated event? We do not know. Only one thing we are certain of, that is, when he does return, all the world will likely know about it, for he must come as the supreme ruler of a universe and not as the obscure babe of Bethlehem. But if every eye is to behold him, and if only spiritual eyes are to discern his presence, then must his advent be long deferred. ([UB 176:4.3-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_3))

> The second advent of Michael on earth is an event of tremendous sentimental value to both midwayers and humans; but otherwise it is of no immediate moment to midwayers and of no more practical importance to human beings than the common event of natural death, which so suddenly precipitates mortal man into the immediate grasp of that succession of universe events which leads directly to the presence of this same Jesus, the sovereign ruler of our universe. The children of light are all destined to see him, and it is of no serious concern whether we go to him or whether he should chance first to come to us. Be you therefore ever ready to welcome him on earth as he stands ready to welcome you in heaven. We confidently look for his glorious appearing, even for repeated comings, but we are wholly ignorant as to how, when, or in what connection he is destined to appear. [UB 176:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_7)

> “After his elevation to settled sovereignty in a local universe a Paradise Michael is in full control of all other Sons of God functioning in his domain, and he may freely rule in accordance with his concept of the needs of his realms. A Master Son may at will vary the order of the spiritual adjudication and evolutionary adjustment of the inhabited planets. And such Sons do make and carry out the plans of their own choosing in all matters of special planetary needs, in particular regarding the worlds of their creature sojourn and still more concerning the realm of terminal bestowal, the planet of incarnation in the likeness of mortal flesh.” [UB 21:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p5_9)
