_By Halbert Katzen J.D._

This Topical Study developed as an outgrowth of [Revelatory Permissions and Limitations](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Revelatory_Permissions_and_Limitations). The second entry, in particular, brings up issues related to clarifying technically incorrect conclusions without providing a full explanation. Such a theme relates to the effort to develop [Astronomy](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Astronomy), which led to developing Revelatory Permissions and Limitations.

> Though personally occupied with administrative duties, Gabriel maintains contact with all other phases of universe life and affairs through the Brilliant Evening Stars. They always accompany him on his planetary tours and frequently go on special missions to the individual planets as his personal representatives. On such assignments they have sometimes been known as “the angel of the Lord.” They frequently go to Uversa to represent the Bright and Morning Star before the courts and assemblies of the Ancients of Days, but they seldom journey beyond the confines of Orvonton. [UB 37:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_3)

> Many of the more literal phenomena ascribed to angels have been performed by the secondary midway creatures. When the early teachers of the gospel of Jesus were thrown into prison by the ignorant religious leaders of that day, an actual “angel of the Lord” “by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth.” But in the case of Peter’s deliverance after the killing of James by Herod’s order, it was a secondary midwayer who performed the work ascribed to an angel. [UB 77:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_12)

> What the Old Testament records describe as conversations between Abraham and God were in reality conferences between Abraham and Melchizedek. Later scribes regarded the term Melchizedek as synonymous with God. The record of so many contacts of Abraham and Sarah with “the angel of the Lord” refers to their numerous visits with Melchizedek. [UB 93:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p9_7)

> 6\. _Sundry names._ The Semites disliked to speak the name of their Deity, and they therefore resorted to numerous appellations from time to time, such as: The Spirit of God, The Lord, The Angel of the Lord, The Almighty, The Holy One, The Most High, Adonai, The Ancient of Days, The Lord God of Israel, The Creator of Heaven and Earth, Kyrios, Jah, The Lord of Hosts, and The Father in Heaven. [UB 96:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p1_9)
