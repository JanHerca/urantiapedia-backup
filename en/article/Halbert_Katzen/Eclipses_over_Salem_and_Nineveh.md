**February 22, 2024**

As we fast approach the second full solar eclipse in seven years over the Bald Knob Cross of Peace, those who study Biblical prophecies are increasingly taking note of peculiarities associated with the upcoming April 8<sup>th</sup> eclipse. This awareness started with the first eclipse, of course.

## Salem

The August 21, 2017 eclipse has become known for passing directly over seven Salem’s, located in Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Kentucky, and South Carolina. (Salem, Wyoming is a defunct town from the 1800’s. A cemetery is all that is left.)

However, suffering a slightly less _direct_ requirement and including the upcoming April 8<sup>th</sup> eclipse brings that number up to twenty.

I have not seen anyone else expand the search to North, South, East and West Salem’s. Interestingly enough, though, there is a West Salem in southeastern Illinois that is under the path of both eclipses. And next to Salem, NY is North Salem and South Salem.

_The Urantia Book_ encapsulates the noteworthy relationship this way:

> Within a few years Melchizedek had gathered around himself a group of pupils, disciples, and believers who formed the nucleus of the later community of Salem. He was soon known throughout Palestine as the priest of El Elyon, the Most High, and as the sage of Salem. Among some of the surrounding tribes he was often referred to as the sheik, or king, of Salem. Salem was the site which after the disappearance of Melchizedek became the city of Jebus, subsequently being called Jerusalem. [UB 93:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_4)

“Sage” is used six times—five times as part of the phrase “sage of Salem” and once in [reference to Amenemope](https://ubannotated.com/ubthenews/urantiabook/papers/p095/#U95_4_1).

Note also that the exact intersection of the eclipses is on Salem Road in Makanda, a very short road with only a few houses.

From the Old Testament we have:

[**Gensis 14:**](/en/Bible/Genesis/14)

> <sup><small>17</small></sup> After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 
> 
> <sup><small>18</small></sup> Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,
> 
> <sup><small>19</small></sup> and he blessed Abram, saying,
> “Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
> Creator of heaven and earth.
> 
> <sup><small>20</small></sup> And praise be to God Most High,
> who delivered your enemies into your hand.”
> Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

[**Psalm 76:**](/en/Bible/Psalms/76)

> <sup><small>1</small></sup> In Judah is God known:
> His name is great in Israel.
> 
> <sup><small>2</small></sup> In Salem also is his tabernacle,
> And his dwelling place in Zion.
> 
> <sup><small>3</small></sup> There brake he the arrows of the bow,
> The shield, and the sword, and the battle.

## Nineveh

With the upcoming eclipse on April 8, 2024, Nineveh’s along the eclipse’s path are being notice. However, it should be mentioned that some scholars were seeing a connection to Nineveh with the arrival of the first eclipse. See: [Jonah & the Eclipse of Ancient Nineveh](https://epicarchaeology.org/2017/08/17/jonah-archaeo-astronomy-the-eclipse-of-ancient-nineveh/) by Ted Wright published on Aug. 17, 2017.

The upcoming eclipse passes over six Nineveh’s, located in Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Nova Scotia. Also along the April path is Jonah, Texas and Rapture, Indiana.

Note also: [ArkEncounter.com](https://arkencounter.com/) in Williamstown, KY sits at the edge of the eclipses’ intersection.

Nineveh is mentioned one time in _The Urantia_ _Book_:

> … Nathaniel was much bothered by some of Jesus’ pronouncements which seemed to detract from the authority of the recognized Hebrew scriptures. Accordingly, on this night, after the usual period of questions and answers, Nathaniel took Jesus away from the others and asked: “Master, could you trust me to know the truth about the Scriptures? I observe that you teach us only a portion of the sacred writings—the best as I view it—and I infer that you reject the teachings of the rabbis to the effect that the words of the law are the very words of God, having been with God in heaven even before the times of Abraham and Moses. What is the truth about the Scriptures?” When Jesus heard the question of his bewildered apostle, he answered: … [UB 159:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_1)

> “Many of these books were not written by the persons whose names they bear, but that in no way detracts from the value of the truths which they contain. If the story of Jonah should not be a fact, even if Jonah had never lived, still would the profound truth of this narrative, the love of God for **Nineveh** and the so-called heathen, be none the less precious in the eyes of all those who love their fellow men. The Scriptures are sacred because they present the thoughts and acts of men who were searching for God, and who in these writings left on record their highest concepts of righteousness, truth, and holiness. The Scriptures contain much that is true, very much, but in the light of your present teaching, you know that these writings also contain much that is misrepresentative of the Father in heaven, the loving God I have come to reveal to all the worlds. … ” ([UB 159:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_4))

One other paragraph mentions Jonah:

> One day after the evening meal Jesus and the young Philistine strolled down by the sea, and Gadiah, not knowing that this “scribe of Damascus” was so well versed in the Hebrew traditions, pointed out to Jesus the ship landing from which it was reputed that Jonah had embarked on his ill-fated voyage to Tarshish. And when he had concluded his remarks, he asked Jesus this question: “But do you suppose the big fish really did swallow Jonah?” Jesus perceived that this young man’s life had been tremendously influenced by this tradition, and that its contemplation had impressed upon him the folly of trying to run away from duty; Jesus therefore said nothing that would suddenly destroy the foundations of Gadiah’s present motivation for practical living. In answering this question, Jesus said: “My friend, we are all Jonahs with lives to live in accordance with the will of God, and at all times when we seek to escape the present duty of living by running away to far-off enticements, we thereby put ourselves in the immediate control of those influences which are not directed by the powers of truth and the forces of righteousness. The flight from duty is the sacrifice of truth. The escape from the service of light and life can only result in those distressing conflicts with the difficult whales of selfishness which lead eventually to darkness and death unless such God-forsaking Jonahs shall turn their hearts, even when in the very depths of despair, to seek after God and his goodness. And when such disheartened souls sincerely seek for God—hunger for truth and thirst for righteousness—there is nothing that can hold them in further captivity. No matter into what great depths they may have fallen, when they seek the light with a whole heart, the spirit of the Lord God of heaven will deliver them from their captivity; the evil circumstances of life will spew them out upon the dry land of fresh opportunities for renewed service and wiser living.” ([UB 130:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p1_2))

The Bible, however, asserts that Jesus made other noteworthy references to Jonah and Nineveh. A little background on how Jonah and Nineveh relate to an eclipse is important for appreciating the New Testament references.

From Wikipedia: Assyrian eclipse, [Role in the Book of Jonah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_eclipse)

> “The Bur-Sagale eclipse occurred \[on June 15, 763 BC\] over the Assyrian capital city of [Nineveh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh) in the middle of the reign of [Jeroboam II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeroboam_II), who ruled Israel from 786 to 746 B.C. According to 2 Kings 14:25, the prophet [Jonah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah) lived and prophesied in Jeroboam’s reign. The biblical scholar [Donald Wiseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Wiseman) has speculated that the eclipse took place around when Jonah arrived in Nineveh and urged the people to repent, otherwise the city would be destroyed. This would explain the dramatic repentance of the people of Nineveh as described in the [Book of Jonah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jonah). Ancient cultures, including Assyria, viewed eclipses as omens of imminent destruction, and the empire was in chaos at this time, struggling with revolts, famines and two separate outbreaks of plague.”

[**Luke 11:**](/en/Bible/Luke/11)

> <sup><small>27</small></sup> And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed _is_ the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
> 
> <sup><small>28</small></sup> But he said, Yea rather, blessed _are_ they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
> 
> <sup><small>29</small></sup> And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
> 
> <sup><small>30</small></sup> For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
> 
> <sup><small>31</small></sup> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon _is_ here.
> 
> <sup><small>32</small></sup> The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah _is_ here.

[**Matthew 12:**](/en/Bible/Matthew/12)

> <sup><small>38</small></sup> Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
> 
> <sup><small>39</small></sup> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:
> 
> <sup><small>40</small></sup> For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
> 
> <sup><small>41</small></sup> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

Some of the Old and New Testament prophecies often referenced by Biblical scholars to support the idea that great transformations are marked by eclipses include:

[**Genesis 1:**](/en/Bible/Genesis/1)

> <sup><small>14</small></sup>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
> 
> <sup><small>15</small></sup>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

[**Isaiah 13:**](/en/Bible/Isaiah/13)

> <sup><small>1</small></sup> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
> <sup><small>2</small></sup> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
> <sup><small>3</small></sup> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, _even_ them that rejoice in my highness.
> <sup><small>4</small></sup> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
> <sup><small>5</small></sup> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, _even_ the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.
> <sup><small>6</small></sup> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD _is_ at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt:
> <sup><small>8</small></sup> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces _shall be as_ flames.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
> <sup><small>10</small></sup> **For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.**
> <sup><small>11</small></sup> And I will punish the world for _their_ evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
> <sup><small>12</small></sup> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
> <sup><small>13</small></sup> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

[**Joel 2:**](/en/Bible/Joel/2)

> <sup><small>1</small></sup> Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for _it is_ nigh at hand;
> <sup><small>2</small></sup> **A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, _even_ to the years of many generations.**
> <sup><small>30</small></sup> And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. …
> <sup><small>31</small></sup> **The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.**

[**Amos 8:**](/en/Bible/Amos/8)

> <sup><small>1</small></sup> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit. <sup><small>2</small></sup> And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more. <sup><small>3</small></sup> And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
> <sup><small>4</small></sup> Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
> <sup><small>5</small></sup> Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
> <sup><small>6</small></sup> That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
> <sup><small>8</small></sup> Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> **And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:**
> <sup><small>10</small></sup> And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
> <sup><small>11</small></sup> Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
> <sup><small>12</small></sup> And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.
> <sup><small>13</small></sup> In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
> <sup><small>14</small></sup> They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.

[**Revelation 6**](/en/Bible/Revelation/6)

> <sup><small>12</small></sup> I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. 13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. <sup><small>14</small></sup> Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. <sup><small>15</small></sup> And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, <sup><small>16</small></sup> and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! <sup><small>17</small></sup> For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”

## Jewish Calendar

The day following the April 8<sup>th</sup> eclipse is also noteworthy for how it relates to the Jewish calendar. From [Chabad.org](https://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day.asp?tdate=4/09/2024):

> Tuesday, April 9, 2024; 1 Nissan, 5784 \[which begins on the eve of April 8<sup>th</sup>\]:
> 
> **Jewish Calendar Inaugurated (1313 BCE)**
> 
> On the first of Nissan of the year 2448 from creation (1313 BCE—two weeks before the Exodus), G-d showed Moses the crescent new moon and told him, “When you see the moon like this, sanctify \[the new month\].” This ushered in the first Jewish month, and commenced the lunar calendar Jews have been following ever since.
> 
> **Mishkan Inaugurated (1312 BCE)**
> 
> On the [eighth day](https://www.chabad.org/article.asp?aid=2868) following a 7-day training and initiation period, the portable Mishkan (“Tabernacle” or “Sanctuary”) built by the Children of Israel in the Sinai desert was erected, [Aaron](https://www.chabad.org/search/keyword.asp?kid=7078) and his sons began serving as priests, and the Divine Presence came to [dwell](https://www.chabad.org/article.asp?aid=68681) in the Mishkan; special offerings were brought, including a series of gifts by Nachshon ben Aminadav, the Prince of the Tribe of Judah (similar offerings were brought over the next 11 days by the other tribes of Israel).

## The Big Question

Is it time for the replacement team? Lucifer and Satan could not have wielded so much influence except that they were vested with powerful positions of celestial authority. Will Melchizedek, the king of righteousness, and a replacement team return with the coming eclipse to complete the restoration of order on our confused world that was started by Jesus?

> …  John wrote: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth and the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a princess adorned for the prince.” [Revelation 21:1-2](/en/Bible/Revelation/21#v1)
> 
> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.” [Isaiah 66:22-23](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66#v22)
> 
> It is the mortals of such an age who are described as “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an exalted people; and you shall show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into this marvelous light.” [1 Peter 2:9](/en/Bible/1_Peter/2#v9)
> 
> No matter what the special natural history of an individual planet may be, no difference whether a realm has been wholly loyal, tainted with evil, or cursed by sin—no matter what the antecedents may be—sooner or later the grace of God and the ministry of angels will usher in the day of the advent of the Trinity Teacher Sons; and their departure, following their final mission, will inaugurate this superb era of light and life.
> 
> All the worlds . . . \[in our region of the cosmos\] can join in the hope of the one who wrote: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth, **wherein dwells righteousness**. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” [2 Peter 3:13-14](/en/Bible/2_Peter/3#v13) ([UB 52:7.11-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_11))

> “But the times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise; not even the angels of heaven know when this will occur. However, you should understand that, when this gospel of the kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the world for the salvation of all peoples, and **when the fullness of the age has come to pass,** **the Father will send you another dispensational bestowal,** **or else the Son of Man will return to adjudge the age.** [UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5)
