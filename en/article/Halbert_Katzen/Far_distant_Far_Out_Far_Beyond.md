_By Halbert Katzen J.D._

The term _far-distant_ is used 39 times. Most of these are related to _time_. The 13 related to _place_ are presented here. Additionally, _far out_ is used 4 times and _far beyond_ is used once with reference to _place_.

Collectively, the number of entries and categories are as follows:

- 1: Questionable Usage.  
- 1: Generally beyond Orvonton.  
- 7: Outer space.  
- 1: Solitary Messengers: between superuniverses.  
- 2: Solitary Messengers: within superuniverses.  
- 5: Paradise/Havona.  
- 1: “not far-distant” reference within our Local Universe.

This cross-reference study was inspired by work on the Astronomy topical study, which raised the question of whether Andromeda should be considered as potentially and eventually occupying a place in Orvonton, as a yet to be inhabited region. Because Andromeda is specifically described as a “far-distant nebula,” this cross-reference study lends support to the perspective that Andromeda should be considered in the first outer space level and, therefore, not potentially a part of Orvonton. To interpret otherwise would violate the pattern established by the other dozen instances of _far-distant_ when used in reference to _place_.

However, the above perspective has a certain weakness, a lack of complete clarity. Notwithstanding that _far-distant_ is usually used to mean a place beyond Orvonton, it is also used twice in connection with traveling the longest distances within a superuniverse.

Questions to consider include: If we are near the out edge of Orvonton, more or less, would Andromeda would not be considered far-distant at one million light years, or at 2.5 or million light years? How is _far-distant_ supposed to be understood in comparison to the general width/breadth dimensions of Orvonton?

See also: [Reader Captivation Phrases](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Reader_Captivation_Phrases/) for additional linguistic analysis supporting the above perspective.

## Questionable Usage:

> Not all spiral nebulae are engaged in sun making. Some have retained control of many of their segregated stellar offspring, and their spiral appearance is occasioned by the fact that their suns pass out of the nebular arm in close formation but return by diverse routes, thus making it easy to observe them at one point but more difficult to see them when widely scattered on their different returning routes farther out and away from the arm of the nebula. There are not many sun-forming nebulae active in Orvonton at the present time, though **Andromeda**, which is outside the inhabited superuniverse, is very active. This **far-distant nebula** is visible to the naked eye, and when you view it, pause to consider that the light you behold left those distant suns almost one million years ago. ([UB 15:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_7))

## Generally beyond Orvonton:

> Of the ten major divisions of Orvonton, eight have been roughly identified by Urantian astronomers. The other two are difficult of separate recognition because you are obliged to view these phenomena from the inside. If you could look upon the superuniverse of Orvonton from a position **far-distant in space**, you would immediately recognize the ten major sectors of the seventh galaxy. ([UB 15:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_4))

## Outer space:

> _The Outer Space Levels._ **Far out** in space, at an enormous distance from the seven inhabited superuniverses, there are assembling vast and unbelievably stupendous circuits of force and materializing energies. Between the energy circuits of the seven superuniverses and this gigantic outer belt of force activity, there is a space zone of comparative quiet, which varies in width but averages about four hundred thousand light-years. These space zones are free from star dust—cosmic fog. Our students of these phenomena are in doubt as to the exact status of the space-forces existing in this zone of relative quiet which encircles the seven superuniverses. But about one-half million light-years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe we observe the beginnings of a zone of an unbelievable energy action which increases in volume and intensity for over twenty-five million light-years. These tremendous wheels of energizing forces are situated in the first outer space level, a continuous belt of cosmic activity encircling the whole of the known, organized, and inhabited creation. ([UB 12:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14))

> Although the unaided human eye can see only two or three nebulae outside the borders of the superuniverse of Orvonton, your telescopes literally reveal millions upon millions of these physical universes in process of formation. Most of the starry realms visually exposed to the search of your present-day telescopes are in Orvonton, but with photographic technique the larger telescopes penetrate **far beyond the borders of the grand universe into the domains of outer space**, where untold universes are in process of organization. And there are yet other millions of universes beyond the range of your present instruments. [UB 12:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_2)

> The Uversa star students observe that the grand universe is surrounded by the ancestors of a series of starry and planetary clusters which completely encircle the present inhabited creation as concentric rings of outer universes upon universes. The physicists of Uversa calculate that the energy and matter of these outer and uncharted regions already equal many times the total material mass and energy charge embraced in all seven superuniverses. We are informed that the metamorphosis of cosmic force in these outer space levels is a function of the Paradise force organizers. We also know that these forces are ancestral to those physical energies which at present activate the grand universe. The Orvonton power directors, however, have nothing to do with these **far-distant realms**, neither are the energy movements therein discernibly connected with the power circuits of the organized and inhabited creations. [UB 12:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_4)

> Although your spectroscopic estimations of astronomic velocities are fairly reliable when applied to the starry realms belonging to your superuniverse and its associate superuniverses, such reckonings with reference to the realms of outer space are wholly unreliable. Spectral lines are displaced from the normal towards the violet by an approaching star; likewise these lines are displaced towards the red by a receding star. Many influences interpose to make it appear that the recessional velocity of the external universes increases at the rate of more than one hundred miles a second for every million light-years increase in distance. By this method of reckoning, subsequent to the perfection of more powerful telescopes, it will appear that these **far-distant systems** are in flight from this part of the universe at the unbelievable rate of more than thirty thousand miles a second. But this apparent speed of recession is not real; it results from numerous factors of error embracing angles of observation and other time-space distortions.
> 
> But the greatest of all such distortions arises because the vast universes of outer space, in the realms next to the domains of the seven superuniverses, seem to be revolving in a direction opposite to that of the grand universe. That is, these myriads of nebulae and their accompanying suns and spheres are at the present time revolving clockwise about the central creation. The seven superuniverses revolve about Paradise in a counterclockwise direction. It appears that the second outer universe of galaxies, like the seven superuniverses, revolves counterclockwise about Paradise. And the astronomic observers of Uversa think they detect evidence of revolutionary movements in a **third outer belt of far-distant space** which are beginning to exhibit directional tendencies of a clockwise nature. [UB 12:4.14-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_14)

> 1. There actually is a vast and new system of universes gradually organizing in the domains of outer space. New orders of physical creations, enormous and gigantic circles of swarming universes upon universes **far out beyond the present bounds of the peopled and organized creations**, are actually visible through your telescopes. At present, these outer creations are wholly physical; they are apparently uninhabited and seem to be devoid of creature administration. \[Note how _organized_ is added as an additional qualifier. Because _peopled_ unquestionably also means organized, is this added on to clarify that what is being referenced is also far beyond physical creations that are destined to become an inhabited parts of the seven superuniverses but are currently uninhabited?\] ([UB 31:10.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_16))

> You have been instructed to a certain extent about the organization and personnel of the central universe, the superuniverses, and the local universes; you have been told something about the character and origin of some of the various personalities who now rule these far-flung creations. You have also been informed that there are in process of organization vast galaxies of universes **far out beyond the periphery of the grand universe, in the first outer space level**. It has also been intimated in the course of these narratives that the Supreme Being is to disclose his unrevealed tertiary function in these now uncharted regions of outer space; and you have also been told that the finaliters of the Paradise corps are the experiential children of the Supreme. ([UB 112:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_16))

## Solitary Messengers: between superuniverses

> \[Provided for context.\] 3. _Messengers of the Superuniverses._ The Ancients of Days, those personalities of Trinity origin who preside over the destinies of the seven superuniverses, those trios of divine power and administrative wisdom, are bountifully supplied with Solitary Messengers. It is only through this order of messengers that the triune rulers of one superuniverse can directly and personally communicate with the rulers of another. Solitary Messengers are the only available type of spirit intelligence—aside, possibly, from the Inspired Trinity Spirits—that can be dispatched from the headquarters of one superuniverse directly to the headquarters of another. All other personalities must make such excursions by way of Havona and the executive worlds of the Master Spirits. ([UB 23:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23#p2_15))

> Much as an Associate Inspector represents the Seven Supreme Executives to a whole local universe, so in each of the ten thousand systems of that local creation there is an Assigned Sentinel, who acts as the direct representative of the **far-distant and supreme board of supercontrol for the affairs of all seven superuniverses**. The sentinels on duty in the local system governments of Orvonton are acting under the direct authority of Supreme Executive Number Seven, the co-ordinator of the seventh superuniverse. But in their administrative organization all sentinels commissioned in a local universe are subordinate to the Associate Inspector stationed at universe headquarters. ([UB 24:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p5_2))

## Solitary Messengers: within superuniverses

> 6. _Ambassadors and Emissaries of Special Assignment._ Local universes situated within the same superuniverse customarily exchange ambassadors selected from their native orders of sonship. But to avoid delay, Solitary Messengers are frequently asked to go as ambassadors from one local creation to another, to represent and interpret one realm to another. For example: When a newly inhabited realm is discovered, it may prove to be so remote in space that a long time will pass before an enseraphimed ambassador can reach this **far-distant universe**. An enseraphimed being cannot possibly exceed the velocity of 558,840 Urantia miles in one second of your time. Massive stars, crosscurrents, and detours, as well as attraction tangents, will all tend to retard such speed so that on a long journey the velocity will average about 550,000 miles per second. ([UB 23:2.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23#p2_22))

> When it develops that it will require hundreds of years for a native ambassador to reach a **far-distant local universe**, a Solitary Messenger is often asked to proceed there immediately to act as ambassador ad interim. Solitary Messengers can go in very short order, not independently of time and space as do the Gravity Messengers, but nearly so. They also serve in other circumstances as emissaries of special assignment. [UB 23:2.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23#p2_23)

## Paradise/Havona:

> The number seven is basic to the central universe and the spiritual system of inherent transmissions of character, but the number ten, the decimal system, is inherent in energy, matter, and the material creation. Nevertheless the atomic world does display a certain periodic characterization which recurs in groups of seven—a birthmark carried by this material world indicative of its **far-distant spiritual origin**. ([UB 42:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p9_2))

> THE perfect and divine universe occupies the center of all creation; it is the eternal core around which the vast creations of time and space revolve. Paradise is the gigantic nuclear Isle of absolute stability which rests motionless at the very heart of the magnificent eternal universe. This central planetary family is called Havona and is **far-distant** from the local universe of Nebadon. It is of enormous dimensions and almost unbelievable mass and consists of one billion spheres of unimagined beauty and superb grandeur, but the true magnitude of this vast creation is really beyond the understanding grasp of the human mind. ([UB 14:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p0_1))

> On the outskirts of this vast central universe, far out beyond the seventh belt of Havona worlds, there swirl an unbelievable number of enormous dark gravity bodies. These multitudinous dark masses are quite unlike other space bodies in many particulars; even in form they are very different. These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light; they are nonreactive to physical-energy light, and they so completely encircle and enshroud Havona as to hide it from the view of even near-by inhabited universes of time and space. \[Note how the reference to _far out_ contrasts with the reference to _neary-by._\] [UB 14:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_14)

> As a result of many suggestive lines of evidence, we believe that the Adjusters are thoroughly organized, that there exists a profoundly intelligent and efficient directive administration of these divine gifts from some **far-distant and central source, probably Divinington**. We know that they come from Divinington to the worlds, and undoubtedly they return thereto upon the deaths of their subjects. ([UB 108:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p3_7))

> I wish it were possible for me to help evolving mortals to achieve a better understanding and attain a fuller appreciation of the unselfish and superb work of the Adjusters living within them, who are so devoutly faithful to the task of fostering man’s spiritual welfare. These Monitors are efficient ministers to the higher phases of men’s minds; they are wise and experienced manipulators of the spiritual potential of the human intellect. These heavenly helpers are dedicated to the stupendous task of guiding you safely inward and upward to the celestial haven of happiness. These tireless toilers are consecrated to the future personification of the triumph of divine truth in your life everlasting. They are the watchful workers who pilot the God-conscious human mind away from the shoals of evil while expertly guiding the evolving soul of man toward the divine harbors of perfection on **far-distant and eternal shores**. The Adjusters are loving leaders, your safe and sure guides through the dark and uncertain mazes of your short earthly career; they are the patient teachers who so constantly urge their subjects forward in the paths of progressive perfection. They are the careful custodians of the sublime values of creature character. I wish you could love them more, co-operate with them more fully, and cherish them more affectionately. ([UB 110:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_2))

## “not far-distant” reference within our Local Universe:

> BY PERMISSION of Lanaforge and with the approval of the Most Highs of Edentia, I am authorized to narrate something of the social, moral, and political life of the most advanced human race living on a **not far-distant** planet belonging to the Satania system. ([UB 72:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p0_1))
