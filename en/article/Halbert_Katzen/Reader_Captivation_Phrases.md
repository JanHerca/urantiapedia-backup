_By Halbert Katzen J.D._

Reader Captivation Phrases focuses on words and phrases that are used to personalize the experience of reading _The Urantia_ _Book._ They encourage reflection on particular points and indicate when human comprehension limitations come into play. The extreme end of the spectrum is its own study: [Beyond Human (Comprehension, Imagination …)](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/beyond_human). This study includes: “pause to consider,” “you should consider,” “consider the status,” “ponder,” and “you can hardly conceive/imagine/comprehend/realize/understand.”

“Pause to consider” is used nine times and all instances are chronologically provided at the end of this study for separate consideration as a turn of phrase.

This topical study is an outgrowth of [Revelation Permissions and Limitations](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Revelatory_Permissions_and_Limitations), which was inspired by the [Astronomy](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Astronomy) topical study. The lead-off quote, concerning the naked-eye view Andomeda, is the specific usage that raised to question as to whether such a creative literary device as this justifies a certain type of interpretation of the text. In this case, the specific issue is whether the distance given is a grounding bit of revelatory information or will eventually need to be revised based on new discoveries or scientific advances.

Your editor is of the opinion that this creative literary device is used to ground us in an understanding of revelatory information.

## Science related

> Not all spiral nebulae are engaged in sun making. Some have retained control of many of their segregated stellar offspring, and their spiral appearance is occasioned by the fact that their suns pass out of the nebular arm in close formation but return by diverse routes, thus making it easy to observe them at one point but more difficult to see them when widely scattered on their different returning routes farther out and away from the arm of the nebula. There are not many sun-forming nebulae active in Orvonton at the present time, though Andromeda, which is outside the inhabited superuniverse, is very active. This far-distant nebula is visible to the naked eye, and **when you view it, pause to consider** that the light you behold left those distant suns almost one million years ago. ([UB 15:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_7))

> These solar temperatures operate to enormously speed up the ultimatons and the electrons, at least such of the latter as continue to maintain their existence under these conditions. **You will realize** what high temperature means by way of the acceleration of ultimatonic and electronic activities **when you pause to consider** that one drop of ordinary water contains over one billion trillions of atoms. This is the energy of more than one hundred horsepower exerted continuously for two years. The total heat now given out by the solar system sun each second is sufficient to boil all the water in all the oceans on Urantia in just one second of time. ([UB 41:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p7_13))

> **You can hardly realize** by what narrow margins your prehuman ancestors missed extinction from time to time. Had the ancestral frog of all humanity jumped two inches less on a certain occasion, the whole course of evolution would have been markedly changed. The immediate lemurlike mother of the dawn-mammal species escaped death no less than five times by mere hairbreadth margins before she gave birth to the father of the new and higher mammalian order. But the closest call of all was when lightning struck the tree in which the prospective mother of the Primates twins was sleeping. Both of these mid-mammal parents were severely shocked and badly burned; three of their seven children were killed by this bolt from the skies. These evolving animals were almost superstitious. This couple whose treetop home had been struck were really the leaders of the more progressive group of the mid-mammal species; and following their example, more than half the tribe, embracing the more intelligent families, moved about two miles away from this locality and began the construction of new treetop abodes and new ground shelters—their transient retreats in time of sudden danger. ([UB 62:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_9))

## Ascension Career

> The manufacturing or laboratory sector of Jerusem is an extensive domain, one which Urantians would hardly recognize since it has no smoking chimneys; nevertheless, there is an intricate material economy associated with these special worlds, and there is a perfection of mechanical technique and physical achievement which would astonish and even awe your most experienced chemists and inventors. **Pause to consider** that this first world of detention in the Paradise journey is far more material than spiritual. Throughout your stay on Jerusem and its transition worlds you are far nearer your earth life of material things than your later life of advancing spirit existence. ([UB 46:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_7))

> Though you have morontia bodies, you continue, through all seven of these worlds, to eat, drink, and rest. You partake of the morontia order of food, a kingdom of living energy unknown on the material worlds. Both food and water are fully utilized in the morontia body; there is no residual waste. **Pause to consider:** Mansonia number one is a very material sphere, presenting the early beginnings of the morontia regime. You are still a near human and not far removed from the limited viewpoints of mortal life, but each world discloses definite progress. From sphere to sphere you grow less material, more intellectual, and slightly more spiritual. The spiritual progress is greatest on the last three of these seven progressive worlds. ([UB 47:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p4_6))

> With the limited range of mortal hearing, **you can hardly conceive** of morontia melodies. There is even a material range of beautiful sound unrecognized by the human sense of hearing, not to mention the inconceivable scope of morontia and spirit harmony. Spirit melodies are not material sound waves but spirit pulsations received by the spirits of celestial personalities. There is a vastness of range and a soul of expression, as well as a grandeur of execution, associated with the melody of the spheres, that are wholly beyond human comprehension. I have seen millions of enraptured beings held in sublime ecstasy while the melody of the realm rolled in upon the spirit energy of the celestial circuits. These marvelous melodies can be broadcast to the uttermost parts of a universe. ([UB 44:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p1_1))

> Mortal creatures living on a sin-stricken, evil-dominated, self-seeking, isolated world, such as Urantia, **can hardly conceive** of the physical perfection, the intellectual attainment, and the spiritual development which characterize these advanced epochs of evolution on a sinless sphere. ([UB 55:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_1))

> **You should consider** the statement about “heaven” and the “heaven of heavens.” The heaven conceived by most of your prophets was the first of the mansion worlds of the local system. When the apostle spoke of being “caught up to the third heaven,” he referred to that experience in which his Adjuster was detached during sleep and in this unusual state made a projection to the third of the seven mansion worlds. Some of your wise men saw the vision of the greater heaven, “the heaven of heavens,” of which the sevenfold mansion world experience was but the first; the second being Jerusem; the third, Edentia and its satellites; the fourth, Salvington and the surrounding educational spheres; the fifth, Uversa; the sixth, Havona; and the seventh, Paradise. ([UB 48:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_23))

## Theology and Cosmology

> Omnipotence does not imply the power to do the nondoable, the ungodlike act. Neither does omniscience imply the knowing of the unknowable. But such statements can hardly be made comprehensible to the finite mind. **The creature can hardly understand** the range and limitations of the will of the Creator. ([UB 3:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p3_5))

> How unreasonable that you should not worship God because the limitations of human nature and the handicaps of your material creation make it impossible for you to see him. Between you and God there is a tremendous distance (physical space) to be traversed. There likewise exists a great gulf of spiritual differential which must be bridged; but notwithstanding all that physically and spiritually separates you from the Paradise personal presence of God, **stop and ponder the solemn fact** that God lives within you; he has in his own way already bridged the gulf. He has sent of himself, his spirit, to live in you and to toil with you as you pursue your eternal universe career. ([UB 2:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_6))

> The Father’s love follows us now and throughout the endless circle of the eternal ages. **As you** **ponder** the loving nature of God, there is only one reasonable and natural personality reaction thereto: You will increasingly love your Maker; you will yield to God an affection analogous to that given by a child to an earthly parent; for, as a father, a real father, a true father, loves his children, so the Universal Father loves and forever seeks the welfare of his created sons and daughters. [UB 2:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_9)

> The Conjoint Creator is truly and forever the great ministering personality, the universal mercy minister. To comprehend the ministry of the Spirit, **ponder the truth** that he is the combined portrayal of the Father’s unending love and of the Son’s eternal mercy. The Spirit’s ministry is not, however, restricted solely to the representation of the Eternal Son and the Universal Father. The Infinite Spirit also possesses the power to minister to the creatures of the realm in his own name and right; the Third Person is of divine dignity and also bestows the universal ministry of mercy in his own behalf. ([UB 8:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_7))

> The universe of universes, with its innumerable host of inhabiting personalities, is a vast and complex organism, but the First Source and Center is infinitely more complex than the universes and personalities which have become real in response to his willful mandates. **When you stand in awe** of the magnitude of the master universe, **pause to consider** that even this inconceivable creation can be no more than a partial revelation of the Infinite. ([UB 105:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p1_7))

> If it is difficult to comprehend that the infinite triodities can function on the finite level, **pause to consider** that their very infinity must in itself contain the potentiality of the finite; infinity encompasses all things ranging from the lowest and most qualified finite existence to the highest and unqualifiedly absolute realities. ([UB 115:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p4_3))

> **You can hardly imagine** what would have happened on Urantia had this God-man, now in potential possession of all power in heaven and on earth, once decided to unfurl the banner of sovereignty, to marshal his wonder-working battalions in militant array! But he would not compromise. He would not serve evil that the worship of God might presumably be derived therefrom. He would abide by the Father’s will. He would proclaim to an onlooking universe, “You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.” ([UB 136:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p9_3))

> You, being a creature, can conceive of a Creator, but **you can hardly comprehend** that there exists an enormous and diversified aggregation of intelligent beings who are neither Creators nor creatures. These Transcendentalers create no beings, neither were they ever created. In speaking of their origin, in order to avoid using a new term—an arbitrary and meaningless designation—we deem it best to say that Transcendentalers simply _eventuate._ The Deity Absolute may well have been concerned in their origin and may be implicated in their destiny, but these unique beings are not now dominated by the Deity Absolute. They are subject to God the Ultimate, and their present Paradise sojourn is in every way Trinity supervised and directed. ([UB 31:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p8_3))

> **Consider the status** of the creature-trinitized sons: They are born and live in the present universe age; they have personalities, together with mind and spirit endowments. They have experiences and the memory thereof, but they do not _grow_ as do ascenders. It is our belief and understanding that these creature-trinitized sons, while they are _in_ the present universe age, are really _of_ the next universe age—the age which will follow the completion of the growth of the Supreme. Hence they are not _in_ the Supreme as of his present status of incompleteness and consequent growth. Thus they are nonparticipating in the experiential growth of the present universe age, being held in reserve for the next universe age. ([UB 117:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p2_3))

## Human History and Culture

> **Think what it would mean** on your world if somewhere in the Levant there were a world center of civilization, a great planetary university of culture, which had functioned uninterruptedly for 37,000 years. And again, **pause to consider** how the moral authority of even such an ancient center would be reinforced were there situated not far-distant still another and older headquarters of celestial ministry whose traditions would exert a cumulative force of 500,000 years of integrated evolutionary influence. It is custom which eventually spreads the ideals of Eden to a whole world. ([UB 51:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p6_3))

> Advancing celestial beings all enjoy rest and the ministry of the reversion directors. All efforts to obtain wholesome diversion and to engage in uplifting play are sound; refreshing sleep, rest, recreation, and all pastimes which prevent the boredom of monotony are worth while. Competitive games, storytelling, and even the taste of good food may serve as forms of self-gratification. (When you use salt to savor food, **pause to consider** that, for almost a million years, man could obtain salt only by dipping his food in ashes.) ([UB 84:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_5))

> When modern man wonders at the presentation of so much in the scriptures of different religions that may be regarded as obscene, he should **pause to consider** that passing generations have feared to eliminate what their ancestors deemed to be holy and sacred. A great deal that one generation might look upon as obscene, preceding generations have considered a part of their accepted mores, even as approved religious rituals. A considerable amount of religious controversy has been occasioned by the never-ending attempts to reconcile olden but reprehensible practices with newly advanced reason, to find plausible theories in justification of creedal perpetuation of ancient and outworn customs. ([UB 92:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_3))

> As Urantia is entering the so-called “horseless age,” you should **pause and ponder** what this animal meant to your ancestors. Men first used horses for food, then for travel, and later in agriculture and war. The horse has long served mankind and has played an important part in the development of human civilization. ([UB 61:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_11))

> And then the apostles sought to know the difference between the meaning of this parable and that of the former parable of the talents, but Jesus would only say, in answer to their many questions: “**Ponder well these words** in your hearts while each of you finds out their true meaning.” ([UB 171:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8_8))

> Simon wanted to speak further, but Jesus raised his hand and, stopping him, went on to say: “None of my apostles are more sincere and honest at heart than you, but not one of them will be so upset and disheartened as you, after my departure. In all of your discouragement my spirit shall abide with you, and these, your brethren, will not forsake you. Do not forget what I have taught you regarding the relation of citizenship on earth to sonship in the Father’s spiritual kingdom. **Ponder well** all that I have said to you about rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and to God that which is God’s. Dedicate your life, Simon, to showing how acceptably mortal man may fulfill my injunction concerning the simultaneous recognition of temporal duty to civil powers and spiritual service in the brotherhood of the kingdom. If you will be taught by the Spirit of Truth, never will there be conflict between the requirements of citizenship on earth and sonship in heaven unless the temporal rulers presume to require of you the homage and worship which belong only to God. ([UB 181:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_10))
