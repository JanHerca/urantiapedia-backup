## Introduction

_The Urantia Book_ encourages gardening as a way of life and emphasizes the historical importance of this pursuit as it relates to the development of civilization. Word searches related to _soil_, _horticulture_, _agriculture,_ and _gardening_ were especially helpful to the development of this Topical Study, as the latter headings suggest.

Regarding the following thematic presentation of material, consider this Topical Study as foundational to [Genetic Introductions, Mutations, and Evolution: a _Urantia Book_ perspective](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Genetic_Introductions_Mutations_and_Evolution). Central themes common to both Topical Studies are expressed in these two paragraphs:

> The inner and the outer worlds have a different set of values. Any civilization is in jeopardy when three quarters of its youth enter materialistic professions and devote themselves to the pursuit of the sensory activities of the outer world. Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. (<a id="a39_398"></a>[UB 111:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_4))

> Modern society is in reverse. Slavery has nearly disappeared; domesticated animals are passing. Civilization is reaching back to fire—the inorganic world—for power. Man came up from savagery by way of fire, animals, and slavery; today he reaches back, discarding the help of slaves and the assistance of animals, while he seeks to wrest new secrets and sources of wealth and power from the elemental storehouse of nature. (<a id="a41_425"></a>[UB 69:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_12))

This Topical Study emphasizes a third concept:

> Mankind was not consigned to agricultural toil as the penalty of supposed sin. “In the sweat of your face shall you eat the fruit of the fields” was not a sentence of punishment pronounced because of man’s participation in the follies of the Lucifer rebellion …  Work with the soil is not a curse; rather is it the highest blessing to all who are thus permitted to enjoy the most human of all human activities. (<a id="a45_414"></a>[UB 66:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_19))

Interestingly enough, gardening—“the highest blessing,” according to _The Urantia Book_—started out as woman’s work and then became the work of slaves. Increasingly, it becomes the work of machines.

I grew up on a decommissioned Pennsylvania farm. The government subsidized the decommissioning of farms because of an economically devastating trend in the northeastern United States. The refrigerated boxcar gave a new competitive advantage to midwest farming.

When I was a young child, my father, who loved tomatoes, said to me, “Your generation will never actually know just how good many fruits and vegetables can truly taste. The effort to use machines for harvesting and the interest in transporting fresh fruits and vegetables from great distances means that the genetics are being manipulated for tougher skins and other considerations, which has significantly sacrificed the satisfactions that come from eating fruits and vegetables. Sorry, son.”

It is hard to imagine. Maybe something like having experience with color movies, but living in a world where black and white dominates the market.

Maybe the challenges we face with farming and food production do not have to do with primarily with new technologies or weather conditions. Maybe the first challenge to address is properly prioritizing and encouraging broad participation in one of the most fundamental experiences related to being a human being—gardening.

## Thematic review

### As Above

Even though plant and animal life is significantly different on mortal spheres than in the celestial realms, how can our reflections on the life to come help us learn to live better now?

> Gardens of God. The system capitals are particularly beautified with material and mineral constructions, while the universe headquarters is more reflective of spiritual glory, but the capitals of the constellations are the acme of morontia activities and living embellishments. On the constellation headquarters worlds living embellishment is more generally utilized, and it is this preponderance of life—botanic artistry—that causes these worlds to be called “the gardens of God.”
> 
> About one half of Edentia is devoted to the exquisite gardens of the Most Highs, and **these gardens are among the most entrancing morontia creations** of the local universe. This explains why the extraordinarily beautiful places on the inhabited worlds of Norlatiadek are so often called “the garden of Eden.” (<a id="a65_314"></a>[UB 43:6.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_1))

> If you enjoy the flowers, shrubs, and trees of Urantia, then will you feast your eyes upon the botanical beauty and the floral grandeur of the supernal gardens of Edentia. But it is beyond my powers of description to undertake to convey to the mortal mind an adequate concept of these beauties of the heavenly worlds. **Truly, eye has not seen such glories as await your arrival** on these worlds of the mortal-ascension adventure. (<a id="a67_435"></a>[UB 43:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_8))

> On Jerusem **you will be amazed** by the agricultural achievements of the wonderful spornagia. There the land is cultivated largely for aesthetic and ornamental effects. The spornagia are the landscape gardeners of the headquarters worlds, and they are both original and artistic in their treatment of the open spaces of Jerusem. They utilize both animals and numerous mechanical contrivances in the culture of the soil. They are intelligently expert in the employment of the power agencies of their realms as well as in the utilization of numerous orders of their lesser brethren of the lower animal creations, many of which are provided them on these special worlds. This order of animal life is now largely directed by the ascending midway creatures from the evolutionary spheres. (<a id="a69_787"></a>[UB 46:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_2))

### General Wisdom

> Seasons and temperature variations occur on all sunlighted and sun-heated planets. Agriculture is universal on all atmospheric worlds; tilling the soil is the one pursuit that is common to the advancing races of all such planets. (<a id="a73_233"></a>[UB 49:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p4_5))

> Man is a creature of the soil, a child of nature; no matter how earnestly he may try to escape from the land, in the last reckoning he is certain to fail. “Dust you are and to dust shall you return” is literally true of all mankind. The basic struggle of man was, and is, and ever shall be, for land. The first social associations of primitive human beings were for the purpose of winning these land struggles. **The land-man ratio underlies all social civilization.** (<a id="a75_472"></a>[UB 68:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_1))

> And now is industry supplementing agriculture, with consequently increased urbanization and multiplication of nonagricultural groups of citizenship classes. But an industrial era cannot hope to survive if its leaders fail to recognize that even **the highest social developments must ever rest upon a sound agricultural basis.** (<a id="a77_332"></a>[UB 68:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_13))

> Frontier society develops the unskilled side of humanity; the fine arts and true scientific progress, together with spiritual culture, have all thrived best in the larger centers of life when supported by an agricultural and industrial population slightly under the land-man ratio. **Cities always multiply the power of their inhabitants for either good or evil.** (<a id="a79_368"></a>[UB 68:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_5))

**From Government on a Neighboring Planet:**

> On this continent it is against the law for two families to live under the same roof. And since group dwellings have been outlawed, most of the tenement type of buildings have been demolished. But the unmarried still live in clubs, hotels, and other group dwellings. **The smallest homesite permitted must provide fifty thousand square feet of land.** \[A bit over an acre.\] All land and other property used for home purposes are free from taxation up to ten times the minimum homesite allotment. (<a id="a83_501"></a>[UB 72:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_1))

> The educational system of this nation is compulsory and coeducational in the precollege schools that the student attends from the ages of five to eighteen. These schools are vastly different from those of Urantia. There are no classrooms, only one study is pursued at a time, and after the first three years all pupils become assistant teachers, instructing those below them. Books are used only to secure information that will assist in solving the problems arising in the school shops and on the school farms. Much of the furniture used on the continent and the many mechanical contrivances—this is a great age of invention and mechanization—are produced in these shops. Adjacent to each shop is a working library where the student may consult the necessary reference books. **Agriculture and horticulture are also taught throughout the entire educational period on the extensive farms adjoining every local school.** (<a id="a85_923"></a>[UB 72:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_1))

> **The feeble-minded are trained only in agriculture and animal husbandry,** and are committed for life to special custodial colonies where they are segregated by sex to prevent parenthood, which is denied all subnormals. These restrictive measures have been in operation for seventy-five years; the commitment decrees are handed down by the parental courts. (<a id="a87_361"></a>[UB 72:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_2))

> The methods of this people in dealing with crime, insanity, and degeneracy, while in some ways pleasing, will, no doubt, in others prove shocking to most Urantians. **Ordinary criminals and the defectives are placed, by sexes, in different agricultural colonies and are more than self-supporting.** The more serious habitual criminals and the incurably insane are sentenced to death in the lethal gas chambers by the courts. Numerous crimes aside from murder, including betrayal of governmental trust, also carry the death penalty, and the visitation of justice is sure and swift. (<a id="a89_584"></a>[UB 72:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p10_1))

### The Divine and Saving Downreach

> \[Approximately 500,000 years ago.\] In the headquarters settlement on your world every human habitation was provided with abundance of land. Although the remote tribes continued in hunting and food foraging, **the students and teachers in the Prince’s schools were all agriculturists and horticulturists.** The time was about equally divided between the following pursuits: (<a id="a93_378"></a>[UB 50:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_3))

> 1. _Physical labor._ Cultivation of the soil, associated with home building and embellishment. (<a id="a95_98"></a>[UB 50:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_4))

> 2. _The board of animal domestication and utilization._ This council was dedicated to the task of selecting and breeding those animals best adapted to help human beings in bearing burdens and transporting themselves, to supply food, and later on to be of service in the cultivation of the soil. This able corps was directed by Bon. (<a id="a97_335"></a>[UB 66:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_4))

> The country around the city was quite well settled within a radius of one hundred miles. Immediately surrounding the city, hundreds of graduates of the Prince’s schools engaged in animal husbandry and otherwise carried out the instruction they had received from his staff and their numerous human helpers. **A few engaged in agriculture and horticulture.** (<a id="a99_360"></a>[UB 66:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_18))

> 4. _The agricultural stage._ This era was brought about by the domestication of plants, and it represents the highest type of material civilization. Both Caligastia and Adam endeavored to teach horticulture and agriculture. **Adam and Eve were gardeners, not shepherds**, and gardening was an advanced culture in those days. **The growing of plants exerts an ennobling influence on all races of mankind.** (<a id="a101_409"></a>[UB 68:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_9))

> But the home as an institution, a partnership between one man and one woman, dates more specifically from the days of Dalamatia, about one-half million years ago, the monogamous practices of Andon and his immediate descendants having been abandoned long before. Family life, however, was not much to boast of before the days of the Nodites and the later Adamites. Adam and Eve exerted a lasting influence on all mankind; for the first time in the history of the world men and women were observed working side by side in the Garden. **The Edenic ideal, the whole family as gardeners, was a new idea on Urantia.** (<a id="a103_615"></a>[UB 84:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_8))

> The mountains surrounding the Garden \[of Eden\] abounded in precious stones and metals, though these received very little attention. **The dominant idea was to be the glorification of horticulture and the exaltation of agriculture.** (<a id="a105_238"></a>[UB 73:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p3_5))

> Although the work of embellishment was hardly finished at the time of Adam’s arrival, the place was already a gem of botanic beauty; and during the early days of his sojourn in Eden the whole Garden took on new form and assumed new proportions of beauty and grandeur. Never before this time nor after has Urantia harbored such a beautiful and replete exhibition of horticulture and agriculture. (<a id="a107_398"></a>[UB 73:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p5_8))

> The entire purpose of the western school system of the Garden was _socialization._ The forenoon periods of recess were devoted to practical horticulture and agriculture, the afternoon periods to competitive play. The evenings were employed in social intercourse and the cultivation of personal friendships. Religious and sexual training were regarded as the province of the home, the duty of parents. (<a id="a109_404"></a>[UB 74:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p7_2))

> In the days of the first Eden, Adam had indeed sought to discourage the offering of animal sacrifice so that Cain had a justifiable precedent for his contentions. It was, however, difficult to organize the religious life of the second Eden. Adam was burdened with a thousand and one details associated with the work of building, defense, and agriculture. Being much depressed spiritually, he intrusted the organization of worship and education to those of Nodite extraction who had served in these capacities in the first garden; and in even so short a time the officiating Nodite priests were reverting to the standards and rulings of pre-Adamic times. (<a id="a111_657"></a>[UB 76:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_3))

Keeping in mind problems associated with the Rebellion and Default, consider the following commentary as it relates to efforts by scholars to study ancient civilizations.

> Man ordinarily evolved into a farmer from a hunter by transition through the era of the herder, and this was also true among the Andites, but more often the evolutionary coercion of climatic necessity would cause whole tribes to pass directly from hunters to successful farmers. But this phenomenon of passing immediately from hunting to agriculture only occurred in those regions where there was a high degree of race mixture with the violet stock. (<a id="a115_453"></a>[UB 81:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_5))

If you are aware of any anthropological/archaeological studies that exemplify this type of rapid transition, please get in touch so that I can add that to the study aid.

### The Evolutionary Experience

> Hunger, vanity, and ghost fear were continuous in their social pressure, but sex gratification was transient and spasmodic. The sex urge alone did not impel primitive men and women to assume the heavy burdens of home maintenance. The early home was founded upon the sex restlessness of the male when deprived of frequent gratification and upon that devoted mother love of the human female, which in measure she shares with the females of all the higher animals. The presence of a helpless baby determined the early differentiation of male and female activities; **the woman had to maintain a settled residence where she could cultivate the soil. And from earliest times, where woman was has always been regarded as the home.** (<a id="a121_730"></a>[UB 68:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_6))

> During this age agriculture makes its appearance. **The growth of the family idea is incompatible with the roving and unsettled life of the hunter.** Gradually the practices of settled habitations and the cultivation of the soil become established. The domestication of animals and the development of home arts proceed apace. Upon reaching the apex of biologic evolution, a high level of civilization has been attained, but there is little development of a mechanical order; invention is the characteristic of the succeeding age. (<a id="a123_533"></a>[UB 52:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_8))

> Agriculture more than quadrupled the land-man ratio of the world. It may be combined with the pastoral pursuits of the former cultural stage. When the three stages overlap, men hunt and women till the soil. (<a id="a125_210"></a>[UB 68:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_10))

> **In early days only the crops were private, but successive crops conferred title; agriculture was thus the genesis of the private ownership of land.** Individuals were first given only a life tenureship; at death land reverted to the tribe. The very first land titles granted by tribes to individuals were graves—family burying grounds. In later times land belonged to those who fenced it. But the cities always reserved certain lands for public pasturage and for use in case of siege; these “commons” represent the survival of the earlier form of collective ownership. (<a id="a127_574"></a>[UB 69:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_14))

> **There has always been friction between the herders and the tillers of the soil.** The hunter and herder were militant, warlike; the agriculturist is a more peace-loving type. Association with animals suggests struggle and force; association with plants instills patience, quiet, and peace. Agriculture and industrialism are the activities of peace. But the weakness of both, as world social activities, is that they lack excitement and adventure. (<a id="a129_452"></a>[UB 68:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_11))

> The herders were the first capitalists; their herds represented capital, and they lived on the interest—the natural increase. And they were disinclined to trust this wealth to the keeping of either slaves or women. **But later on they took male prisoners and forced them to cultivate the soil. This is the early origin of serfdom—man attached to the land.** The Africans could easily be taught to till the soil; hence they became the great slave race. (<a id="a131_455"></a>[UB 69:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_5))

> Since slaves were so generally employed by the earlier agriculturists, the farmer was formerly looked down on by both the hunter and the herder. **For ages it was considered menial to till the soil; wherefore the idea that soil toil is a curse, whereas it is the greatest of all blessings.** Even in the days of Cain and Abel the sacrifices of the pastoral life were held in greater esteem than the offerings of agriculture. (<a id="a133_428"></a>[UB 81:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_4))

> It may be that the instinct of motherhood led woman into marriage, but it was man’s superior strength, together with the influence of the mores, that virtually compelled her to remain in wedlock. **Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of family life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitrary authority of the father.** All society, whether national or familial, passed through the stage of the autocratic authority of a patriarchal order. (<a id="a135_552"></a>[UB 84:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_1))

> **Woman’s first liberation came when man consented to till the soil, consented to do what had theretofore been regarded as woman’s work.** It was a great step forward when male captives were no longer killed but were enslaved as agriculturists. This brought about the liberation of woman so that she could devote more time to homemaking and child culture. (<a id="a137_359"></a>[UB 84:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_8))

> Decreasing primitive warfare greatly lessened the disparity between the division of labor based on sex. But women still had to do the real work while men did picket duty. No camp or village could be left unguarded day or night, but even this task was alleviated by the domestication of the dog. In general, the coming of agriculture has enhanced woman’s prestige and social standing; at least this was true up to the time man himself turned agriculturist. **And as soon as man addressed himself to the tilling of the soil, there immediately ensued great improvement in methods of agriculture, extending on down through successive generations.** In hunting and war man had learned the value of organization, and he introduced these techniques into industry and later, when taking over much of woman’s work, greatly improved on her loose methods of labor. (<a id="a139_857"></a>[UB 84:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_10))

> Despite failure to fulfill the promise of an early development of advanced statehood, the yellow race did progressively move forward in the realization of the arts of civilization, especially in the realms of agriculture and horticulture. The hydraulic problems faced by the agriculturists in Shensi and Honan demanded group co-operation for solution. Such irrigation and soil-conservation difficulties contributed in no small measure to the development of interdependence with the consequent promotion of peace among farming groups. (<a id="a141_537"></a>[UB 79:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_6))

> About fifteen thousand years ago the Alpine forests were spreading extensively. The European hunters were being driven to the river valleys and to the seashores by the same climatic coercion that had turned the world’s happy hunting grounds into dry and barren deserts. As the rain winds shifted to the north, the great open grazing lands of Europe became covered by forests. These great and relatively sudden climatic modifications drove the races of Europe to change from open-space hunters to herders, and in some measure to fishers and tillers of the soil. (<a id="a143_564"></a>[UB 80:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_8))

> With the completion of the conquest of eastern Asia the ancient military state gradually disintegrated—past wars were forgotten. Of the epic struggle with the red race there persisted only the hazy tradition of an ancient contest with the archer peoples. **The Chinese early turned to agricultural pursuits, which contributed further to their pacific tendencies**, while a population well below the land-man ratio for agriculture still further contributed to the growing peacefulness of the country. <a id="a145_502"></a>[UB 79:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_2)

> Consciousness of past achievements (somewhat diminished in the present), **the conservatism of an overwhelmingly agricultural people,** and a well-developed family life equaled the birth of ancestor veneration, culminating in the custom of so honoring the men of the past as to border on worship. A very similar attitude prevailed among the white races in Europe for some five hundred years following the disruption of Greco-Roman civilization. (<a id="a147_448"></a>[UB 79:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_3))

> The formative period of Chinese civilization, opening with the coming of the Andites, continues on down to the great ethical, moral, and semireligious awakening of the sixth century before Christ. And Chinese tradition preserves the hazy record of the evolutionary past; the transition from mother- to father-family, the establishment of agriculture, the development of architecture, the initiation of industry—all these are successively narrated. And this story presents, with greater accuracy than any other similar account, the picture of the magnificent ascent of a superior people from the levels of barbarism. During this time they passed from a primitive agricultural society to a higher social organization embracing cities, manufacture, metalworking, commercial exchange, government, writing, mathematics, art, science, and printing. (<a id="a149_846"></a>[UB 79:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_15))

> The evolutionary peoples (notably the Chinese) early learned to plant seeds and to cultivate crops through observation of the sprouting of seeds accidentally moistened or which had been put in graves as food for the departed. But throughout southwest Asia, along the fertile river bottoms and adjacent plains, the Andites were carrying out the improved agricultural techniques inherited from their ancestors, who had made farming and gardening the chief pursuits within the boundaries of the second garden. (<a id="a151_510"></a>[UB 81:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_6))

> The climatic destruction of the rich, open grassland hunting and grazing grounds of Turkestan, beginning about 12,000 B.C., compelled the men of those regions to resort to new forms of industry and crude manufacturing. Some turned to the cultivation of domesticated flocks, others became agriculturists or collectors of water-borne food, but the higher type of Andite intellects chose to engage in trade and manufacture. It even became the custom for entire tribes to dedicate themselves to the development of a single industry. From the valley of the Nile to the Hindu Kush and from the Ganges to the Yellow River, the chief business of the superior tribes became the cultivation of the soil, with commerce as a side line. (<a id="a153_727"></a>[UB 81:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_1))

> The migratory conquests of the Andites continued on down to their final dispersions, from 8000 to 6000 B.C. As they poured out of Mesopotamia, they continuously depleted the biologic reserves of their homelands while markedly strengthening the surrounding peoples. **And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture. They were skillful domesticators of animals and expert agriculturists.** For the time being, at least, their presence usually improved the religious beliefs and moral practices of the older races. And so the culture of Mesopotamia quietly spread out over Europe, India, China, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands. (<a id="a155_698"></a>[UB 78:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_8))

> Most of the animals best suited to domestication were found in Asia, especially in the central to southwest regions. This was one reason why civilization progressed faster in that locality than in other parts of the world. Many of these animals had been twice before domesticated, and in the Andite age they were retamed once again. But the dog had remained with the hunters ever since being adopted by the blue man long, long before. (<a id="a157_438"></a>[UB 81:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_11))

> The Andites of Turkestan were the first peoples to extensively domesticate the horse, and this is another reason why their culture was for so long predominant. By 5000 B.C. the Mesopotamian, Turkestan, and Chinese farmers had begun the raising of sheep, goats, cows, camels, horses, fowls, and elephants. They employed as beasts of burden the ox, camel, horse, and yak. Man was himself at one time the beast of burden. One ruler of the blue race once had one hundred thousand men in his colony of burden bearers. (<a id="a159_516"></a>[UB 81:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_12))

> The institutions of slavery and private ownership of land came with agriculture. **Slavery raised the master’s standard of living and provided more leisure for social culture.** (<a id="a161_181"></a>[UB 81:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_13))

> **And now is industry supplementing agriculture, with consequently increased urbanization and multiplication of nonagricultural groups of citizenship classes. But an industrial era cannot hope to survive if its leaders fail to recognize that even the highest social developments must ever rest upon a sound agricultural basis.** (<a id="a163_332"></a>[UB 68:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_13))

## Soil Till-

These great and relatively sudden climatic modifications drove the races of **Europe to change from open-space hunters to herders, and in some measure to fishers and tillers of the soil.** (<a id="a175_568"></a>[UB 80:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_8))

> Since slaves were so generally employed by the earlier agriculturists, the farmer was formerly looked down on by both the hunter and the herder. For ages it was considered menial to till the soil; **wherefore the idea that soil toil is a curse**, whereas it is the greatest of all blessings. Even in the days of Cain and Abel the sacrifices of the pastoral life were held in greater esteem than the offerings of agriculture. (<a id="a177_428"></a>[UB 81:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_4))

> The herdsman looked to his flocks for sustenance, but throughout these pastoral ages woman must still provide the vegetable food. **Primitive man shunned the soil**; it was altogether too peaceful, too unadventuresome. There was also an old superstition that women could raise better plants; they were mothers. In many backward tribes today, the men cook the meat, the women the vegetables, and **when the primitive tribes of Australia are on the march, the women never attack game, while a man would not stoop to dig a root**. (<a id="a179_531"></a>[UB 84:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_6))

> **Woman’s first liberation came when man consented to till the soil**, consented to do what had theretofore been regarded as woman’s work. It was a great step forward when male captives were no longer killed but were enslaved as agriculturists. This brought about the liberation of woman so that she could devote more time to homemaking and child culture. (<a id="a181_359"></a>[UB 84:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_8))

> Decreasing primitive warfare greatly lessened the disparity between the division of labor based on sex. But women still had to do the real work while men did picket duty. No camp or village could be left unguarded day or night, but even this task was alleviated by the domestication of the dog. In general, the coming of agriculture has enhanced woman’s prestige and social standing; at least this was true up to the time man himself turned agriculturist. And **as soon as man addressed himself to the tilling of the soil, there immediately ensued great improvement** in methods of agriculture, extending on down through successive generations. In hunting and war man had learned the value of organization, and he introduced these techniques into industry and later, when taking over much of woman’s work, greatly improved on her loose methods of labor. (<a id="a183_857"></a>[UB 84:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_10))

## Soil Cultivat-

> In the headquarters settlement on your world every human habitation was provided with abundance of land. Although the remote tribes continued in hunting and food foraging, the students and teachers in the Prince’s schools were all agriculturists and horticulturists. The time was about equally divided between the following pursuits: (<a id="a187_337"></a>[UB 50:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_3))

> 1. _Physical labor._ **Cultivation of the soil**, associated with home building and embellishment. (<a id="a189_102"></a>[UB 50:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_4))

> During this age agriculture makes its appearance. The growth of the family idea is incompatible with the roving and unsettled life of the hunter. Gradually the practices of settled habitations and the **cultivation of the soil** become established. The domestication of animals and the development of home arts proceed apace. Upon reaching the apex of biologic evolution, a high level of civilization has been attained, but there is little development of a mechanical order; invention is the characteristic of the succeeding age. (<a id="a191_533"></a>[UB 52:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_8))

> 2. _The board of animal domestication and utilization._ This council was dedicated to the task of selecting and breeding those animals best adapted to help human beings in bearing burdens and transporting themselves, to supply food, and later on to be of service in the **cultivation of the soil**. This able corps was directed by Bon. (<a id="a193_339"></a>[UB 66:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_4))

> Mankind was not consigned to agricultural toil as the penalty of supposed sin. “In the sweat of your face shall you eat the fruit of the fields” was not a sentence of punishment pronounced because of man’s participation in the follies of the Lucifer rebellion under the leadership of the traitorous Caligastia. The **cultivation of the soil is inherent in the establishment of an advancing civilization** on the evolutionary worlds, and this injunction was the center of all teaching of the Planetary Prince and his staff throughout the three hundred thousand years which intervened between their arrival on Urantia and those tragic days when Caligastia threw in his lot with the rebel Lucifer. Work with the soil is not a curse; rather is it the highest blessing to all who are thus permitted to enjoy the most human of all human activities. (<a id="a195_846"></a>[UB 66:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_19))

> Hunger, vanity, and ghost fear were continuous in their social pressure, but sex gratification was transient and spasmodic. The sex urge alone did not impel primitive men and women to assume the heavy burdens of home maintenance. The early home was founded upon the sex restlessness of the male when deprived of frequent gratification and upon that devoted mother love of the human female, which in measure she shares with the females of all the higher animals. **The presence of a helpless baby determined the early differentiation of male and female activities; the woman had to maintain a settled residence where she could cultivate the soil.** And from earliest times, where woman was has always been regarded as the home. (<a id="a197_730"></a>[UB 68:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_6))

> The climatic destruction of the rich, open grassland hunting and grazing grounds of Turkestan, beginning about 12,000 B.C., compelled the men of those regions to resort to new forms of industry and crude manufacturing. Some turned to the cultivation of domesticated flocks, others became agriculturists or collectors of water-borne food, but the higher type of Andite intellects chose to engage in trade and manufacture. It even became the custom for entire tribes to dedicate themselves to the development of a single industry. **From the valley of the Nile to the Hindu Kush and from the Ganges to the Yellow River, the chief business of the superior tribes became the cultivation of the soil, with commerce as a side line.** (<a id="a199_731"></a>[UB 81:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_1))

## Horticulture

> The country around the city was quite well settled within a radius of one hundred miles. Immediately surrounding the city, hundreds of graduates of the Prince’s schools engaged in animal husbandry and otherwise carried out the instruction they had received from his staff and their numerous human helpers. **A few engaged in agriculture and horticulture.** (<a id="a203_360"></a>[UB 66:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_18))

> 4. _The agricultural stage._ This era was brought about by the domestication of plants, and it represents the highest type of material civilization. **Both Caligastia and Adam endeavored to teach horticulture and agriculture**. Adam and Eve were gardeners, not shepherds, and gardening was an advanced culture in those days. The growing of plants exerts an ennobling influence on all races of mankind. (<a id="a205_405"></a>[UB 68:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_9))

> The educational system of this nation is compulsory and coeducational in the precollege schools that the student attends from the ages of five to eighteen. These schools are vastly different from those of Urantia. There are no classrooms, only one study is pursued at a time, and after the first three years all pupils become assistant teachers, instructing those below them. Books are used only to secure information that will assist in solving the problems arising in the school shops and on the school farms. Much of the furniture used on the continent and the many mechanical contrivances—this is a great age of invention and mechanization—are produced in these shops. Adjacent to each shop is a working library where the student may consult the necessary reference books. **Agriculture and horticulture are also taught throughout the entire educational period on the extensive farms adjoining every local school.** (<a id="a207_923"></a>[UB 72:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_1))

> The mountains surrounding the Garden abounded in precious stones and metals, though these received very little attention. **The dominant idea was to be the glorification of horticulture and the exaltation of agriculture.** (<a id="a209_226"></a>[UB 73:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p3_5))

> Although the work of embellishment was hardly finished at the time of Adam’s arrival, the place was already a gem of botanic beauty; and during the early days of his sojourn in Eden the whole Garden took on new form and assumed new proportions of beauty and grandeur. **Never before this time nor after has Urantia harbored such a beautiful and replete exhibition of horticulture and agriculture.** (<a id="a211_402"></a>[UB 73:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p5_8))

> **The entire purpose of the western school system of the Garden was _socialization._ The forenoon periods of recess were devoted to practical horticulture and agriculture,** the afternoon periods to competitive play. The evenings were employed in social intercourse and the cultivation of personal friendships. Religious and sexual training were regarded as the province of the home, the duty of parents. (<a id="a213_408"></a>[UB 74:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p7_2))

> **Despite failure to fulfill the promise of an early development of advanced statehood, the yellow race did progressively move forward in the realization of the arts of civilization, especially in the realms of agriculture and horticulture.** The hydraulic problems faced by the agriculturists in Shensi and Honan demanded group co-operation for solution. Such irrigation and soil-conservation difficulties contributed in no small measure to the development of interdependence with the consequent promotion of peace among farming groups. (<a id="a215_541"></a>[UB 79:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_6))

## Agricultur-

> And now is industry supplementing agriculture, with consequently increased urbanization and multiplication of nonagricultural groups of citizenship classes. **But an industrial era cannot hope to survive if its leaders fail to recognize that even the highest social developments must ever rest upon a sound agricultural basis.** (<a id="a219_332"></a>[UB 68:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_13))

> Frontier society develops the unskilled side of humanity; the fine arts and true scientific progress, together with spiritual culture, have all thrived best in the larger centers of life when supported by an agricultural and industrial population slightly under the land-man ratio. Cities always multiply the power of their inhabitants for either good or evil. (<a id="a221_364"></a>[UB 68:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_5))

> **The feeble-minded are trained only in agriculture and animal husbandry,** and are committed for life to special custodial colonies where they are segregated by sex to prevent parenthood, which is denied all subnormals. These restrictive measures have been in operation for seventy-five years; the commitment decrees are handed down by the parental courts. (<a id="a223_361"></a>[UB 72:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_2))

> The methods of this people in dealing with crime, insanity, and degeneracy, while in some ways pleasing, will, no doubt, in others prove shocking to most Urantians. **Ordinary criminals and the defectives are placed, by sexes, in different agricultural colonies and are more than self-supporting.** The more serious habitual criminals and the incurably insane are sentenced to death in the lethal gas chambers by the courts. Numerous crimes aside from murder, including betrayal of governmental trust, also carry the death penalty, and the visitation of justice is sure and swift. (<a id="a225_584"></a>[UB 72:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p10_1))

> In the days of the first Eden, Adam had indeed sought to discourage the offering of animal sacrifice so that Cain had a justifiable precedent for his contentions. It was, however, difficult to organize the religious life of the second Eden. **Adam was burdened with a thousand and one details associated with the work of building, defense, and agriculture.** Being much depressed spiritually, he intrusted the organization of worship and education to those of Nodite extraction who had served in these capacities in the first garden; and in even so short a time the officiating Nodite priests were reverting to the standards and rulings of pre-Adamic times. (<a id="a227_661"></a>[UB 76:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_3))

> **The migratory conquests of the Andites continued** on down to their final dispersions, from 8000 to 6000 B.C. As they poured out of Mesopotamia, they continuously depleted the biologic reserves of their homelands while markedly strengthening the surrounding peoples. And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture. **They were skillful domesticators of animals and expert agriculturists.** For the time being, at least, their presence usually improved the religious beliefs and moral practices of the older races. And so the culture of Mesopotamia quietly spread out over Europe, India, China, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands. (<a id="a229_702"></a>[UB 78:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_8))

> With the completion of the conquest of eastern Asia the ancient military state gradually disintegrated—past wars were forgotten. Of the epic struggle with the red race there persisted only the hazy tradition of an ancient contest with the archer peoples. **The Chinese early turned to agricultural pursuits, which contributed further to their pacific tendencies, while a population well below the land-man ratio for agriculture still further contributed to the growing peacefulness of the country.** (<a id="a231_503"></a>[UB 79:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_2))

> Consciousness of past achievements (somewhat diminished in the present), **the conservatism of an overwhelmingly agricultural people**, and a well-developed family life equaled the birth of ancestor veneration, culminating in the custom of so honoring the men of the past as to border on worship. A very similar attitude prevailed among the white races in Europe for some five hundred years following the disruption of Greco-Roman civilization. (<a id="a233_448"></a>[UB 79:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_3))

> The formative period of Chinese civilization, opening with the coming of the Andites, continues on down to the great ethical, moral, and semireligious awakening of the sixth century before Christ. **And Chinese tradition preserves the hazy record of the evolutionary past; the transition from mother- to father-family, the establishment of agriculture, the development of architecture, the initiation of industry—all these are successively narrated.** And this story presents, with greater accuracy than any other similar account, the picture of the magnificent ascent of a superior people from the levels of barbarism. During this time they passed from a primitive agricultural society to a higher social organization embracing cities, manufacture, metalworking, commercial exchange, government, writing, mathematics, art, science, and printing. (<a id="a235_850"></a>[UB 79:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_15))

> The evolutionary peoples (notably the Chinese) early learned to plant seeds and to cultivate crops through observation of the sprouting of seeds accidentally moistened or which had been put in graves as food for the departed. But throughout southwest Asia, along the fertile river bottoms and adjacent plains, **the Andites were carrying out the improved agricultural techniques inherited from their ancestors**, who had made farming and gardening the chief pursuits within the boundaries of the second garden. (<a id="a237_514"></a>[UB 81:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_6))

> Man ordinarily evolved into a farmer from a hunter by transition through the era of the herder, and this was also true among the Andites, but more often the evolutionary coercion of climatic necessity would cause whole tribes to pass directly from hunters to successful farmers. **But this phenomenon of passing immediately from hunting to agriculture only occurred in those regions where there was a high degree of race mixture with the violet stock.** (<a id="a239_457"></a>[UB 81:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_5))

> Most of the animals best suited to domestication were found in Asia, especially in the central to southwest regions. This was one reason why civilization progressed faster in that locality than in other parts of the world. Many of these animals had been twice before domesticated, and in the Andite age they were retamed once again. But the dog had remained with the hunters ever since being adopted by the blue man long, long before. (<a id="a241_438"></a>[UB 81:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_11))

> The Andites of Turkestan were the first peoples to extensively domesticate the horse, and this is another reason why their culture was for so long predominant. By 5000 B.C. the Mesopotamian, Turkestan, and Chinese farmers had begun the raising of sheep, goats, cows, camels, horses, fowls, and elephants. They employed as beasts of burden the ox, camel, horse, and yak. Man was himself at one time the beast of burden. One ruler of the blue race once had one hundred thousand men in his colony of burden bearers. (<a id="a243_516"></a>[UB 81:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_12))

> **The institutions of slavery and private ownership of land came with agriculture.** Slavery raised the master’s standard of living and provided more leisure for social culture. (<a id="a245_181"></a>[UB 81:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_13))

> It may be that the instinct of motherhood led woman into marriage, but it was man’s superior strength, together with the influence of the mores, that virtually compelled her to remain in wedlock. **Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of family life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitrary authority of the father.** All society, whether national or familial, passed through the stage of the autocratic authority of a patriarchal order. (<a id="a247_552"></a>[UB 84:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_1))

> **Joseph early began to instruct Jesus in the diverse means of gaining a livelihood, explaining the advantages of agriculture over industry and trade.** Galilee was a more beautiful and prosperous district than Judea, and it cost only about one fourth as much to live there as in Jerusalem and Judea. It was a province of agricultural villages and thriving industrial cities, containing more than two hundred towns of over five thousand population and thirty of over fifteen thousand. (<a id="a249_488"></a>[UB 124:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_9))

> This was the year that Jesus rented a considerable piece of land just to the north of their home, which was divided up as a family garden plot. **Each of the older children had an individual garden, and they entered into keen competition in their agricultural efforts. Their eldest brother spent some time with them in the garden each day during the season of vegetable cultivation. As Jesus worked with his younger brothers and sisters in the garden, he many times entertained the wish that they were all located on a farm out in the country where they could enjoy the liberty and freedom of an unhampered life.** But they did not find themselves growing up in the country; and Jesus, being a thoroughly practical youth as well as an idealist, intelligently and vigorously attacked his problem just as he found it, and did everything within his power to adjust himself and his family to the realities of their situation and to adapt their condition to the highest possible satisfaction of their individual and collective longings. (<a id="a251_1035"></a>[UB 126:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_10))

## Gardening

> Gardens of God. The system capitals are particularly beautified with material and mineral constructions, while the universe headquarters is more reflective of spiritual glory, but the capitals of the constellations are the acme of morontia activities and living embellishments. On the constellation headquarters worlds living embellishment is more generally utilized, and **it is this preponderance of life—botanic artistry—that causes these worlds to be called “the gardens of God.”**
> 
> About one half of Edentia is devoted to the exquisite gardens of the Most Highs, and **these gardens are among the most entrancing morontia creations of the local universe**. This explains why the extraordinarily beautiful places on the inhabited worlds of Norlatiadek are so often called “the garden of Eden.” (<a id="a257_314"></a>[UB 43:6.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_1))

> **If you enjoy the flowers, shrubs, and trees of Urantia, then will you feast your eyes upon the botanical beauty and the floral grandeur of the supernal gardens of Edentia.** But it is beyond my powers of description to undertake to convey to the mortal mind an adequate concept of these beauties of the heavenly worlds. Truly, eye has not seen such glories as await your arrival on these worlds of the mortal-ascension adventure. (<a id="a259_435"></a>[UB 43:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_8))

> **On Jerusem you will be amazed by the agricultural achievements of the wonderful spornagia.** There the land is cultivated largely for aesthetic and ornamental effects. The spornagia are the landscape gardeners of the headquarters worlds, and they are both original and artistic in their treatment of the open spaces of Jerusem. They utilize both animals and numerous mechanical contrivances in the culture of the soil. They are intelligently expert in the employment of the power agencies of their realms as well as in the utilization of numerous orders of their lesser brethren of the lower animal creations, many of which are provided them on these special worlds. This order of animal life is now largely directed by the ascending midway creatures from the evolutionary spheres. (<a id="a261_787"></a>[UB 46:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_2))

> But the home as an institution, a partnership between one man and one woman, dates more specifically from the days of Dalamatia, about one-half million years ago, the monogamous practices of Andon and his immediate descendants having been abandoned long before. Family life, however, was not much to boast of before the days of the Nodites and the later Adamites. Adam and Eve exerted a lasting influence on all mankind; for the first time in the history of the world men and women were observed working side by side in the Garden. **The Edenic ideal, the whole family as gardeners, was a new idea on Urantia.** (<a id="a263_615"></a>[UB 84:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_8))
