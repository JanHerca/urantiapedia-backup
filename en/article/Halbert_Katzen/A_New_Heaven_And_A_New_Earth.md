## Introduction

> This world has never seriously or sincerely or honestly tried out these dynamic ideas and divine ideals of Jesus’ doctrine of the kingdom of heaven. But you should not become discouraged by the apparently slow progress of the kingdom idea on Urantia \[Earth\]. Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes in both the material and the spiritual worlds. The bestowal of Jesus as an incarnated Son was just such a strange and unexpected event in the spiritual life of the world. Neither make the fatal mistake, in looking for the age manifestation of the kingdom, of failing to effect its establishment within your own souls.![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriseShine-1024x653.jpeg) ([UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14))

> \[In further answer to Peter’s question, Jesus said . . .\] “But what is the significance of this teaching having to do with the coming of the Sons of God? Do you not perceive that, when each of you is called to lay down his life struggle and pass through the portal of death, you stand in the immediate presence of judgment, and that you are face to face with the facts of a new dispensation of service in the eternal plan of the infinite Father? What the whole world must face as a literal fact at the end of an age, you, as individuals, must each most certainly face as a personal experience when you reach the end of your natural life and thereby pass on to be confronted with the conditions and demands inherent in the next revelation of the eternal progression of the Father’s kingdom.” ([UB 176:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_7))

If you are new to _The Urantia Book_ and somehow found yourself here first, this page is one of the most intriguing ways to get introduced to _The Urantia Book_, but you will need to roll along with this a little bit, as your understanding of _Urantia Book_ cosmology grows with reading through the material. General information for new visitors can be accessed on the [Home](https://ubannotated.com/) page, of course. Links and commentaries are inserted on this page to assist new visitors with getting up to speed.

This study is, perhaps, best thought of as a subtopic of the Topical Study: [Prophecy and “signs of the times”](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Prophecy_and_signs_of_the_times).

A general knowledge of what is referred to in Christianity as the [Great Tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tribulation) will support a deeper understanding of this material.

At [Matthew 16:4](/en/Bible/Matthew/16#v4), this statement is attributed to Jesus, “A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” Does Jonah symbolize tribulation? Perhaps this was a prophetic statement, indicating that just prior to the creation of a new heaven and new earth, the signs of the times will have to do with tribulation.

That being said . . .

Is something like the Great Tribulation ever due to occur? Is it happening now? Has such a dramatic event been prophesied and have such prophecies been validated by _The Urantia Book_?

We can study this together, notwithstanding that each of us must reach our own conclusions.

Some students of _The Urantia Book_ are inclined to believe that no rapture, “end of the world,” apocalypse, or Judgment Day type event is going to happen to our planet. The following two paragraphs are often used to support this perspective:

> Urantia is the sentimental shrine of all Nebadon \[our section of the universe\], the chief of ten million inhabited worlds, the mortal home of Christ Michael \[Jesus\], sovereign of all Nebadon, a Melchizedek minister to the realms, a system savior, an Adamic redeemer, a seraphic fellow, an associate of ascending spirits, a morontia progressor, a Son of Man in the likeness of mortal flesh, and the Planetary Prince of Urantia. And your record tells the truth when it says that this same Jesus has promised sometime to return to the world of his terminal bestowal, the World of the Cross. ([UB 119:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_8))

> “You behold me now in weakness and in the flesh, but when I return, it shall be with power and in the spirit. The eye of flesh beholds the Son of Man in the flesh, but only the eye of the spirit will behold the Son of Man glorified by the Father and appearing on earth in his own name.” ([UB 176:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_4))

These two paragraphs lead some people to conclude that there needs to be continuity of habitation on our planet. But _The Urantia Book_ offers no particular teaching to support this presumption. Some type of rapture and return of those saved is also consistent with what is said (and referenced) on this subject.

_The Urantia Book_ references passages in the Bible about a new heaven and a new earth in a manner that validates them.

If our planet becomes uninhabitable for any reason, man-made or not, the celestial servants of God could restore it. Our God is a renewing and rehabilitating God. We should, at the very least, consider the possibility that the salvable population could be taken off the planet for a period of time and then returned after the celestials have done the work necessary to return it to a habitable state (and then some, as the prophecies indicate).

As much as we humans do need to work out our own problems on a personal spiritual level, we should never lose sight of the fact that we are the children of a world gone wrong–through no fault of our own–on a collective level. Humanity is not responsible for the Lucifer Rebellion or the Adamic default. We are experiencing enormous problems that we did not create and this led directly to causing us to mishandle circumstances that we do not understand.

We are the children of an all-powerful, wise, and loving, just, and merciful God (Jesus). ALL THINGS are possible. Creative thinking is encouraged in spiritual teachings. It is even said that God works in strange ways. But there is nothing strange about the celestial hosts arriving to fix what is broken due to the Lucifer Rebellion and the default of Adam and Eve.

Dramatic things–positive and negative–occurred when Jesus came as the Son of Man around 2000 years ago? Numerous natural and manmade events or combinations of events could render our planet uninhabitable. Given all this, is it really so strange to think that even more dramatic things will occur if Melchizedek returns after 4000 years on more than an emergency mission (to prepare the world for Jesus). Prophecies and _The Urantia Book_ indicate that the next phase involves a collective level of healing, restoration, and renewal.

A looser but intriguing enough connection between this topic and prophecy includes what is attributed to be a [prophecy received by George Washington](https://sign.org/articles/george-washingtons-vision-and-prophecy-about-america-158453).  

In any case, the good news is that, if the whole earth is going to be renewed, I suppose we do not need to be concerned about showing up anywhere in particular or what to pack for the trip. On the other hand, seeing as there is a full solar eclipse on the schedule for April 8, 2024 at Bald Knob Cross of Peace, if you want to be hopeful about all of this with a bunch of other people, I look forward to seeing you there.

## The Great Tribulation: teachings and prophecies about a new heaven and a new earth

This study provides a look at the text surrounding several places where _The Urantia Book_ quotes Biblical passages. Then, it reviews how several words and phrases are used in _The Urantia Book_ (new earth, end of the world, and crisis/crises) and finishes with select passages in Daniel and Enoch related to Jesus’ use of the term “Son of Man.”

In the following five paragraphs, _The Urantia Book_ calls our attention to past revelations and teachings about a new heaven and new earth.

> It was of the conclusion of the terminal mission of the Teacher Sons (at least that would be the chronology on a normal world) that John wrote: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth and the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a princess adorned for the prince.”
> 
> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.”
> 
> It is the mortals of such an age who are described as “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an exalted people; and you shall show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into this marvelous light.”
> 
> No matter what the special natural history of an individual planet may be, no difference whether a realm has been wholly loyal, tainted with evil, or cursed by sin—no matter what the antecedents may be—sooner or later the grace of God and the ministry of angels will usher in the day of the advent of the Trinity Teacher Sons; and their departure, following their final mission, will inaugurate this superb era of light and life.
> 
> All the worlds . . . \[in our region of the cosmos\] can join in the hope of the one who wrote: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” \[Note: Melchizedek means “king of righteousness.” Might this allude to the return of Melchizedek?\] ([UB 52:7.11-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_11))

The first quote is from [Revelation 21](/en/Bible/Revelation/21), which also states (KJV):

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
> 
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
> 
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
> 
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
> 
> <sup><small>5</sup></small>  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
> 
> <sup><small>6</sup></small>  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
> 
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
> 
> <sup><small>8</sup></small>  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
> 
> <sup><small>9</sup></small>  And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
> 
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
> 
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; . . .
> 
> <sup><small>23</sup></small>  And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
> 
> <sup><small>24</sup></small>  And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
> 
> <sup><small>25</sup></small>  And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
> 
> <sup><small>26</sup></small>  And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
> 
> <sup><small>27</sup></small>  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

The second quote is from [Isaiah 66](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66) (Judgment and Hope):

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  This is what the LORD says: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be? <sup><small>2</sup></small>  Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?” declares the LORD. “These are the ones I look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word. <sup><small>3</sup></small>  But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a person, and whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig’s blood, and whoever burns memorial incense is like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations; <sup><small>4</sup></small>  so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.” <sup><small>5</sup></small>  Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: “Your own people who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!’ Yet they will be put to shame. <sup><small>6</sup></small>  Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve.
> 
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  “Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son. <sup><small>8</sup></small>  Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children. <sup><small>9</sup></small>  Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the LORD. “Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.
> 
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her. <sup><small>11</sup></small>  For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.” <sup><small>12</sup></small>  For this is what the LORD says: “I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees. <sup><small>13</sup></small>  As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.” <sup><small>14</sup></small>  When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
> 
> <sup><small>15</sup></small>  See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. <sup><small>16</sup></small>  For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the LORD. <sup><small>17</sup></small>  “Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things—they will meet their end together with the one they follow,” declares the LORD.
> 
> <sup><small>18</sup></small>  “And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come and gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory. <sup><small>19</sup></small>  “I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. <sup><small>20</sup></small>  And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels. <sup><small>21</sup></small>  And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the LORD.
> 
> <sup><small>22</sup></small>  “As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the LORD, “so will your name and descendants endure. <sup><small>23</sup></small>  From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the LORD.
> 
> <sup><small>24</sup></small>  “And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”

The third quote is from [1 Peter 2](/en/Bible/1_Peter/2):

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
> 
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
> 
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
> 
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,
> 
> <sup><small>5</sup></small>  Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
> 
> <sup><small>6</sup></small>  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
> 
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
> 
> <sup><small>8</sup></small>  And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
> 
> <sup><small>9</sup></small>  But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;
> 
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
> 
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
> 
> <sup><small>12</sup></small>  Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
> 
> <sup><small>13</sup></small>  Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
> 
> <sup><small>14</sup></small>  Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
> 
> <sup><small>15</sup></small>  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
> 
> <sup><small>16</sup></small>  As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
> 
> <sup><small>17</sup></small>  Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
> 
> <sup><small>18</sup></small>  Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
> 
> <sup><small>19</sup></small>  For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
> 
> <sup><small>20</sup></small>  For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
> 
> <sup><small>21</sup></small>  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
> 
> <sup><small>22</sup></small>  Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
> 
> <sup><small>23</sup></small>  Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:
> 
> <sup><small>24</sup></small>  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
> 
> <sup><small>25</sup></small>  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

The quote concerning the new heaven and new earth found in the last paragraph is form [2 Peter 3](/en/Bible/2_Peter/3):

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
> 
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
> 
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
> 
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
> 
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  . . .
> 
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
> 
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
> 
> <sup><small>12</sup></small>  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
> 
> <sup><small>13</sup></small>  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. \[Consider that Melchizedek means “king of righteousness.”
> 
> <sup><small>14</sup></small>  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

## Select word and phrase usages

### Crisis/crises:

\[Etymology of crisis: From Ancient Greek κρίσις (krísis, “a separating, power of distinguishing, decision, choice, election, judgment, dispute”), from κρίνω(krínō, “pick out, choose, decide, judge”).\]

> Although Jesus referred one phase of the kingdom to the future and did, _on numerous occasions_, intimate that such an event might appear as a part of a world crisis; and though he did likewise most certainly, on several occasions, definitely promise sometime to return to Urantia, it should be recorded that he never positively linked these two ideas together. He promised a new revelation of the kingdom on earth and at some future time; he also promised sometime to come back to this world in person; but he did not say that these two events were synonymous. From all we know these promises may, or may not, refer to the same event. \[Emphasis added. Note also that, if Jesus were to return right after a crisis, this scenario would work well with what has been written in this revelation and past prophecies.\] ([UB 170:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_15))

> Institutional religion cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction. Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in the present crisis of civilization. ([UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1))

> But five hundred years of the overlordship of alien rulers was too much for even the patient and long-suffering Jews. The prophets and priests began to cry: “How long, O Lord, how long?” As the honest Jew searched the Scriptures, his confusion became worse confounded. An olden seer promised that God would protect and deliver his “chosen people.” Amos had threatened that God would abandon Israel unless they re-established their standards of national righteousness. The scribe of Deuteronomy had portrayed the Great Choice—as between the good and the evil, the blessing and the curse. Isaiah the first had preached a beneficent king-deliverer. Jeremiah had proclaimed an era of inner righteousness—the covenant written on the tablets of the heart. The second Isaiah talked about salvation by sacrifice and redemption. Ezekiel proclaimed deliverance through the service of devotion, and Ezra promised prosperity by adherence to the law. But in spite of all this they lingered on in bondage, and deliverance was deferred. Then Daniel presented the drama of the impending “crisis”—the smiting of the great image and the immediate establishment of the everlasting reign of righteousness, the Messianic kingdom. ([UB 97:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p8_3))

> In a crisis the actual and sovereign head of the government, excepting in certain purely spiritual matters, would be this Vorondadek Son of Edentia now on observation duty. (In these exclusively spiritual problems and in certain purely personal matters, the supreme authority seems to be vested in the commanding archangel attached to the divisional headquarters of that order which was recently established on Urantia.)
> 
>  Most High observer is empowered, at his discretion, to seize the planetary government in times of grave planetary crises, and it is of record that this has happened thirty-three times in the history of Urantia. At such times the Most High observer functions as the Most High regent, exercising unquestioned authority over all ministers and administrators resident on the planet excepting only the divisional organization of the archangels. ([UB 114:4.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_3))

> This seven years of waiting was a time of heart searching and soul discipline. Such crises in the affairs of a universe demonstrate the tremendous influence of mind as a factor in spiritual choosing. Education, training, and experience are factors in most of the vital decisions of all evolutionary moral creatures. But it is entirely possible for the indwelling spirit to make direct contact with the decision-determining powers of the human personality so as to empower the fully consecrated will of the creature to perform amazing acts of loyal devotion to the will and the way of the Father in Paradise. And this is just what occurred in the experience of Amadon, the modified human associate of Van. ([UB 67:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_7))

\[Note that we are now in the just under seven year period between the eclipses that crisscross the United States and are bookends to the 4000th anniversary of Machiventa’s appearance on Urantia. Just saying … ;-)\]

### Select passages with “the end of the world/an age”:

> About one hundred years before the days of Jesus and John a new school of religious teachers arose in Palestine, the apocalyptists. These new teachers evolved a system of belief that accounted for the sufferings and humiliation of the Jews on the ground that they were paying the penalty for the nation’s sins. They fell back onto the well-known reasons assigned to explain the Babylonian and other captivities of former times. But, so taught the apocalyptists, Israel should take heart; the days of their affliction were almost over; the discipline of God’s chosen people was about finished; God’s patience with the gentile foreigners was about exhausted. The end of Roman rule was synonymous with the end of the age and, in a certain sense, with the end of the world. These new teachers leaned heavily on the predictions of Daniel, and they consistently taught that creation was about to pass into its final stage; the kingdoms of this world were about to become the kingdom of God. To the Jewish mind of that day this was the meaning of that phrase—the kingdom of heaven—which runs throughout the teachings of both John and Jesus. To the Jews of Palestine the phrase “kingdom of heaven” had but one meaning: an absolutely righteous state in which God (the Messiah) would rule the nations of earth in perfection of power just as he ruled in heaven—”Your will be done on earth as in heaven.” ([UB 135:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_2))

> THIS Tuesday afternoon, as Jesus and the apostles passed out of the temple on their way to the Gethsemane camp, Matthew, calling attention to the temple construction, said: “Master, observe what manner of buildings these are. See the massive stones and the beautiful adornment; can it be that these buildings are to be destroyed?” As they went on toward Olivet, Jesus said: “You see these stones and this massive temple; verily, verily, I say to you: In the days soon to come there shall not be left one stone upon another. They shall all be thrown down.” These remarks depicting the destruction of the sacred temple aroused the curiosity of the apostles as they walked along behind the Master; they could conceive of no event short of the end of the world which would occasion the destruction of the temple. ([UB 176:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p0_1))

> Even after this explicit warning, many of Jesus’ followers interpreted these predictions as referring to the changes which would obviously occur in Jerusalem when the reappearing of the Messiah would result in the establishment of the New Jerusalem and in the enlargement of the city to become the world’s capital. In their minds these Jews were determined to connect the destruction of the temple with the “end of the world.” They believed this New Jerusalem would fill all Palestine; that the end of the worldwould be followed by the immediate appearance of the “new heavens and the new earth.” And so it was not strange that Peter should say: “Master, we know that all things will pass away when the new heavens and the new earth appear, but how shall we know when you will return to bring all this about?” ([UB 176:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_6))

> As these thirteen men resumed their journey toward the camp, they were speechless and under great emotional tension. Judas had finally confirmed his decision to abandon his associates. It was a late hour when David Zebedee, John Mark, and a number of the leading disciples welcomed Jesus and the twelve to the new camp, but the apostles did not want to sleep; they wanted to know more about the destruction of Jerusalem, the Master’s departure, and the end of the world. ([UB 176:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_9))

> “And even you, Thomas, fail to comprehend what I have been saying. Have I not all this time taught you that your connection with the kingdom is spiritual and individual, wholly a matter of personal experience in the spirit by the faith-realization that you are a son of God? What more shall I say? The downfall of nations, the crash of empires, the destruction of the unbelieving Jews, the end of an age, even the end of the world, what have these things to do with one who believes this gospel, and who has hid his life in the surety of the eternal kingdom? You who are God-knowing and gospel-believing have already received the assurances of eternal life. Since your lives have been lived in the spirit and for the Father, nothing can be of serious concern to you. Kingdom builders, the accredited citizens of the heavenly worlds, are not to be disturbed by temporal upheavals or perturbed by terrestrial cataclysms. What does it matter to you who believe this gospel of the kingdom if nations overturn, the age ends, or all things visible crash, since you know that your life is the gift of the Son, and that it is eternally secure in the Father? Having lived the temporal life by faith and having yielded the fruits of the spirit as the righteousness of loving service for your fellows, you can confidently look forward to the next step in the eternal career with the same survival faith that has carried you through your first and earthly adventure in sonship with God. ([UB 176:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_2))

> Jesus did, on numerous occasions and to many individuals, declare his intention of returning to this world. As his followers awakened to the fact that their Master was not going to function as a temporal deliverer, and as they listened to his predictions of the overthrow of Jerusalem and the downfall of the Jewish nation, they most naturally began to associate his promised return with these catastrophic events. But when the Roman armies leveled the walls of Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and dispersed the Judean Jews, and still the Master did not reveal himself in power and glory, his followers began the formulation of that belief which eventually associated the second coming of Christ with the end of the age, even with the end of the world. ([UB 176:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_2))

> Throughout the vicissitudes of life, remember always to love one another. Do not strive with men, even with unbelievers. Show mercy even to those who despitefully abuse you. Show yourselves to be loyal citizens, upright artisans, praiseworthy neighbors, devoted kinsmen, understanding parents, and sincere believers in the brotherhood of the Father’s kingdom. And my spirit shall be upon you, now and even to the end of the world. ([UB 178:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_17))

> “But what is the significance of this teaching having to do with the coming of the Sons of God? Do you not perceive that, when each of you is called to lay down his life struggle and pass through the portal of death, you stand in the immediate presence of judgment, and that you are face to face with the facts of a new dispensation of service in the eternal plan of the infinite Father? What the whole world must face as a literal fact at the end of an age, you, as individuals, must each most certainly face as a personal experience when you reach the end of your natural life and thereby pass on to be confronted with the conditions and demands inherent in the next revelation of the eternal progression of the Father’s kingdom.” ([UB 176:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_7))

### “New earth” is used six times:

>  that John wrote: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth and the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a princess adorned for the prince.”
> 
> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.” ([UB 52:7.11-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_11))

> All the worlds of Satania can join in the hope of the one who wrote: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” [UB 52:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_15)

> While the Jews differed greatly in their estimates of the nature of the coming kingdom, they were alike in their belief that the event was impending, near at hand, even at the door. Many who read the Old Testament literally looked expectantly for a new king in Palestine, for a regenerated Jewish nation delivered from its enemies and presided over by the successor of King David, the Messiah who would quickly be acknowledged as the rightful and righteous ruler of all the world. Another, though smaller, group of devout Jews held a vastly different view of this kingdom of God. They taught that the coming kingdom was not of this world, that the world was approaching its certain end, and that “a new heaven and a new earth” were to usher in the establishment of the kingdom of God; that this kingdom was to be an everlasting dominion, that sin was to be ended, and that the citizens of the new kingdom were to become immortal in their enjoyment of this endless bliss. ([UB 135:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_4))

> Through the supervising control of his associated and Personalized Adjuster it was possible for Michael perfectly to limit his personal earth activities with reference to space, but it was not possible for the Son of Man thus to limit his new earth status as potential Sovereign of Nebadon as regards _time._And this was the actual status of Jesus of Nazareth as he went forth to begin his public ministry on Urantia. ([UB 136:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_6))

> Even after this explicit warning, many of Jesus’ followers interpreted these predictions as referring to the changes which would obviously occur in Jerusalem when the reappearing of the Messiah would result in the establishment of the New Jerusalem and in the enlargement of the city to become the world’s capital. In their minds these Jews were determined to connect the destruction of the temple with the “end of the world.” They believed this New Jerusalem would fill all Palestine; that the end of the world would be followed by the immediate appearance of the “new heavens and the new earth.” And so it was not strange that Peter should say: “Master, we know that all things will pass away when the new heavens and the new earth appear, but how shall we know when you will return to bring all this about?” ([UB 176:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_6))

### Select usages and related passages for “new world”:

> While there is this dematerializing technique for preparing the Adams for transit from Jerusem to the evolutionary worlds, there is no equivalent method for taking them away from such worlds unless the entire planet is to be emptied, in which event emergency installation of the dematerialization technique is made for the entire salvable population. If some physical catastrophe should doom the planetary residence of an evolving race, the Melchizedeks and the Life Carriers would install the technique of dematerialization for all survivors, and by seraphic transport these beings would be carried away to the new world prepared for their continuing existence. The evolution of a human race, once initiated on a world of space, must proceed quite independently of the physical survival of that planet, but during the evolutionary ages it is not otherwise intended that a Planetary Adam or Eve shall leave their chosen world. ([UB 51:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_3))

> In connection with the recital of Jesus’ sermon it should be noted that throughout the Hebrew scriptures there was a dual concept of the kingdom of heaven. The prophets presented the kingdom of God as:
> 
> 1. A present reality; and as
> 
> 2. A future hope—when the kingdom would be realized in fullness upon the appearance of the Messiah. This is the kingdom concept which John the Baptist taught.
> 
> From the very first Jesus and the apostles taught both of these concepts. There were two other ideas of the kingdom which should be borne in mind:
> 
> 3. The later Jewish concept of a world-wide and transcendental kingdom of supernatural origin and miraculous inauguration.
> 
> 4. The Persian teachings portraying the establishment of a divine kingdom as the achievement of the triumph of good over evil at the end of the world.
> 
> Just before the advent of Jesus on earth, the Jews combined and confused all of these ideas of the kingdom into their apocalyptic concept of the Messiah’s coming to establish the age of the Jewish triumph, the eternal age of God’s supreme rule on earth, the new world, the era in which all mankind would worship Yahweh. In choosing to utilize this concept of the kingdom of heaven, Jesus elected to appropriate the most vital and culminating heritage of both the Jewish and Persian religions. ([UB 170:1.1-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p1_1))

### Select passages with “new age”:

**John the Baptist and Jesus**

> Elizabeth kept John posted about Palestinian and world affairs, and his conviction grew deeper and deeper that the time was fast approaching when the old order was to end; that he was to become the herald of the approach of a new age, “the kingdom of heaven.” This rugged shepherd was very partial to the writings of the Prophet Daniel. He read a thousand times Daniel’s description of the great image, which Zacharias had told him represented the history of the great kingdoms of the world, beginning with Babylon, then Persia, Greece, and finally Rome. John perceived that already was Rome composed of such polyglot peoples and races that it could never become a strongly cemented and firmly consolidated empire. He believed that Rome was even then divided, as Syria, Egypt, Palestine, and other provinces; and then he further read “in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And this kingdom shall not be left to other people but shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.” “And there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom never shall be destroyed.” “And the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.” ([UB 135:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p3_2))

> At last he thought out the method of proclaiming the new age, the kingdom of God; he settled that he was to become the herald of the Messiah; he swept aside all doubts and departed from Engedi one day in March of A.D. 25 to begin his short but brilliant career as a public preacher. ([UB 135:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_6))

> The Jews entertained many ideas about the expected deliverer, and each of these different schools of Messianic teaching was able to point to statements in the Hebrew scriptures as proof of their contentions. In a general way, the Jews regarded their national history as beginning with Abraham and culminating in the Messiah and the new age of the kingdom of God. In earlier times they had envisaged this deliverer as “the servant of the Lord,” then as “the Son of Man,” while latterly some even went so far as to refer to the Messiah as the “Son of God.” But no matter whether he was called the “seed of Abraham” or “the son of David,” all were agreed that he was to be the Messiah, the “anointed one.” Thus did the concept evolve from the “servant of the Lord” to the “son of David,” “Son of Man,” and “Son of God.” ([UB 136:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_1))

**Next Visitation**

> Although Peter, James, and John could not understand very much of what Jesus said on this occasion, his gracious words lingered in their hearts, and after the crucifixion and resurrection they came forth greatly to enrich and gladden their subsequent ministry. No wonder these apostles did not fully comprehend the Master’s words, for he was projecting to them the plan of a new age. ([UB 141:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p7_15))

> The apostles were unable to grasp the real meaning of the Master’s utterances regarding the kingdom. The subsequent distortion of Jesus’ teachings, as they are recorded in the New Testament, is because the concept of the gospel writers was colored by the belief that Jesus was then absent from the world for only a short time; that he would soon return to establish the kingdom in power and glory—just such an idea as they held while he was with them in the flesh. But Jesus did not connect the establishment of the kingdom with the idea of his return to this world. That centuries have passed with no signs of the appearance of the “New Age” is in no way out of harmony with Jesus’ teaching. ([UB 170:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_10))

> Being of assignment to the high Sons and Spirits, these seraphim are naturally associated with the far-flung services of the Paradise Avonals, the divine offspring of the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit. The Paradise Avonals are always attended on all magisterial and bestowal missions by this high and experienced order of seraphim, who are at such times devoted to organizing and administering the special work connected with the termination of one planetary dispensation and the inauguration of a new age. But they are not concerned in the work of adjudication which might be incidental to such a change in dispensations. ([UB 39:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p1_3))

## Son of Man

Expanding on _Urantia Book_ teaching about the “Son of Man”:

> In the course of this year Jesus found a passage in the so-called Book of Enoch which influenced him in the later adoption of the term “Son of Man” as a designation for his bestowal mission on Urantia. He had thoroughly considered the idea of the Jewish Messiah and was firmly convinced that he was not to be that Messiah. He longed to help his father’s people, but he never expected to lead Jewish armies in overthrowing the foreign domination of Palestine. He knew he would never sit on the throne of David at Jerusalem. Neither did he believe that his mission was that of a spiritual deliverer or moral teacher solely to the Jewish people. In no sense, therefore, could his life mission be the fulfillment of the intense longings and supposed Messianic prophecies of the Hebrew scriptures; at least, not as the Jews understood these predictions of the prophets. Likewise he was certain he was never to appear as the Son of Man depicted by the Prophet Daniel. \[But does this mean that Machiventa Melchizedek, Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia, will not come back in fulfillment of this prophecy?\] ([UB 126:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_6))

> While turning all these problems over in his mind, he found in the synagogue library at Nazareth, among the apocalyptic books which he had been studying, this manuscript called “The Book of Enoch”; and though he was certain that it had not been written by Enochof old, it proved very intriguing to him, and he read and reread it many times. There was one passage which particularly impressed him, a passage in which this term “Son of Man” appeared. The writer of this so-called Book of Enochwent on to tell about this Son of Man, describing the work he would do on earth and explaining that this Son of Man, before coming down on this earth to bring salvation to mankind, had walked through the courts of heavenly glory with his Father, the Father of all; and that he had turned his back upon all this grandeur and glory to come down on earth to proclaim salvation to needy mortals. As Jesus would read these passages (well understanding that much of the Eastern mysticism which had become admixed with these teachings was erroneous), he responded in his heart and recognized in his mind that of all the Messianic predictions of the Hebrew scriptures and of all the theories about the Jewish deliverer, none was so near the truth as this story tucked away in this only partially accredited Book of Enoch; and he then and there decided to adopt as his inaugural title “the Son of Man.” And this he did when he subsequently began his public work. Jesus had an unerring ability for the recognition of truth, and truth he never hesitated to embrace, no matter from what source it appeared to emanate. ([UB 126:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_8))

[THE BOOK OF ENOCH. CHAPTER 71](/en/Bible/Book_of_Enoch/71).

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  And it came to pass after this that my spirit was translated And it ascended into the heavens: And I saw the holy sons of God. They were stepping on flames of fire: Their garments were white \[and their raiment\], And their faces shone like snow.
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  And I saw two streams of fire, And the light of that fire shone like hyacinth, And I fell on my face before the Lord of Spirits.
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  And the angel Michael \[one of the archangels\] seized me by my right hand, And lifted me up and led me forth into all the secrets, And he showed me all the secrets of righteousness.
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  And he showed me all the secrets of the ends of the heaven, And all the chambers of all the stars, and all the luminaries, Whence they proceed before the face of the holy ones.
> <sup><small>5</sup></small>  And he translated my spirit into the heaven of heavens, And I saw there as it were a structure built of crystals, And between those crystals tongues of living fire.  
>     (Revelation 21:10-11), (Acts 2:3)
> <sup><small>6</sup></small>  And my spirit saw the girdle which girt that house of fire, And on its four sides were streams full of living fire, And they girt that house.

>     (2 Kings 19:15), (Psalm 80:1), (Psalm 99:1), (Isaiah 37:16)
> <sup><small>8</sup></small>  And I saw angels who could not be counted, A thousand thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand, Encircling that house. And Michael, and Raphael, and Gabriel, and Phanuel, And the holy angels who are above the heavens, Go in and out of that house.  
>     (Revelation 5:11)
> <sup><small>9</sup></small>  And they came forth from that house, And Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel, And many holy angels without number.
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  And with them the Head of Days, His head white and pure as wool, And His raiment indescribable.  
>     (Isaiah 6:1-5), (Daniel 7:9, 13)
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  And I fell on my face, And my whole body became relaxed, And my spirit was transfigured; And I cried with a loud voice, . . . with the spirit of power, And blessed and glorified and extolled.
> <sup><small>12</sup></small>  And these blessings which went forth out of my mouth were well pleasing before that Head of Days.
> <sup><small>13</sup></small>  And that Head of Days came with Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel, thousands and ten thousands of angels without number.
> <sup><small>14</sup></small>  And he (i.e. the angel) came to me and greeted me with His voice, and said unto me ‘ This is the Son of Man who is born unto righteousness, And righteousness abides over him, And the righteousness of the Head of Days forsakes him not.’  
>     (Daniel 7:13), (Jeremiah 33:15), (The Book of Enoch 62:1-2)
> <sup><small>15</sup></small>  And he said unto me: ‘ He proclaims unto thee peace in the name of the world to come; For from hence has proceeded peace since the creation of the world, And so shall it be unto thee for ever and for ever and ever.

> <sup><small>17</sup></small>  And so there shall be length of days with that Son of Man, And the righteous shall have peace and an upright way In the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.’  
>     (John 14:6), (Isaiah 35:8), (Hebrews 10:19-20), (Jeremiah 50:4-6), (Isaiah 26:3-4, 12), (Isaiah 57:2), (John 14:27), (John 16:33), (Philippians 4:7)

[Daniel 7](/en/Bible/Daniel/7) (KJV):

> <sup><small>13</sup></small>  I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
> 
> <sup><small>14</sup></small>  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
> 
> <sup><small>15</sup></small>  I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
> 
> <sup><small>16</sup></small>  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
> 
> <sup><small>17</sup></small>  These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
> 
> <sup><small>18</sup></small>  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
> 
> <sup><small>19</sup></small>  Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
> 
> <sup><small>20</sup></small>  And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
> 
> <sup><small>21</sup></small>  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
> 
> <sup><small>22</sup></small>  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
> 
> <sup><small>23</sup></small>  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
> 
> <sup><small>24</sup></small>  And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
> 
> <sup><small>25</sup></small>  And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
> 
> <sup><small>26</sup></small>  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
> 
> <sup><small>27</sup></small>  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
> 
> <sup><small>28</sup></small>  Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

And finally, a few more passages about Daniel from _The Urantia Book_:

> National egotism, false faith in a misconceived promised Messiah, and the increasing bondage and tyranny of the priesthood forever silenced the voices of the spiritual leaders (excepting Daniel, Ezekiel, Haggai, and Malachi); and from that day to the time of John the Baptist all Israel experienced an increasing spiritual retrogression. But the Jews never lost the concept of the Universal Father; even to the twentieth century after Christ they have continued to follow this Deity conception. \[Note the implication that Daniel is not suffering from misconceived notions about a promised Messiah.\] ([UB 97:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p10_3))

> Down through the ages there has been great confusion on Urantia regarding the various universe rulers. Many later teachers confused their vague and indefinite tribal deities with the Most High Fathers. Still later, the Hebrews merged all of these celestial rulers into a composite Deity. One teacher understood that the Most Highs were not the Supreme Rulers, for he said, “He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” In the Urantia records it is very difficult at times to know exactly who is referred to by the term “Most High.” But Daniel fully understood these matters. He said, “The Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever he will.” ([UB 43:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p3_4))

> Elizabeth kept John \[the Baptist\] posted about Palestinian and world affairs, and his conviction grew deeper and deeper that the time was fast approaching when the old order was to end; that he was to become the herald of the approach of a new age, “the kingdom of heaven.” This rugged shepherd was very partial to the writings of the Prophet Daniel. He read a thousand times Daniel’s description of the great image, which Zacharias had told him represented the history of the great kingdoms of the world, beginning with Babylon, then Persia, Greece, and finally Rome. John perceived that already was Rome composed of such polyglot peoples and races that it could never become a strongly cemented and firmly consolidated empire. He believed that Rome was even then divided, as Syria, Egypt, Palestine, and other provinces; and then he further read “in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And this kingdom shall not be left to other people but shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.” “And there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom never shall be destroyed.” “And the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.” ([UB 135:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p3_2))

> The scribes and rabbis, taken together, were called Pharisees. They referred to themselves as the “associates.” In many ways they were the progressive group among the Jews, having adopted many teachings not clearly found in the Hebrew scriptures, such as belief in the resurrection of the dead, a doctrine only mentioned by a later prophet, Daniel. ([UB 137:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p7_6))
