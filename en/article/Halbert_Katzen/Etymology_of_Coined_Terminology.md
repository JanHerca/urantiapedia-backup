## Introduction: the World of the Cross

Before getting into _Urantia Book_ etymology, an instance of _Urantia Book_ phraseology merits attention. The phrase _world of the cross_ appears four times. Note that between quotation marks and capitalization issues, it is never used the same way twice. Why?

> When the bestowal Sons, Creator or Magisterial, enter the portals of death, they reappear on the third day. But you should not entertain the idea that they always meet with the tragic end encountered by the Creator Son who sojourned on your world nineteen hundred years ago. The extraordinary and unusually cruel experience through which Jesus of Nazareth passed has caused Urantia to become locally known as “the world of the cross.” It is not necessary that such inhuman treatment be accorded a Son of God, and the vast majority of planets have afforded them a more considerate reception, allowing them to finish their mortal careers, terminate the age, adjudicate the sleeping survivors, and inaugurate a new dispensation, without imposing a violent death. A bestowal Son must encounter death, must pass through the whole of the actual experience of mortals of the realms, but it is not a requirement of the divine plan that this death be either violent or unusual. <a id="a33_971"></a>[UB 20:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_6)

> It was at about this time that Urantia was assigned to the system of Satania for planetary administration and was placed on the life registry of Norlatiadek. Then began the administrative recognition of the small and insignificant sphere which was destined to be the planet whereon Michael would subsequently engage in the stupendous undertaking of mortal bestowal, would participate in those experiences which have since caused Urantia to become locally known as the “world of the cross.” <a id="a35_492"></a>[UB 57:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_6)

> Urantia is the sentimental shrine of all Nebadon, the chief of ten million inhabited worlds, the mortal home of Christ Michael, sovereign of all Nebadon, a Melchizedek minister to the realms, a system savior, an Adamic redeemer, a seraphic fellow, an associate of ascending spirits, a morontia progressor, a Son of Man in the likeness of mortal flesh, and the Planetary Prince of Urantia. And your record tells the truth when it says that this same Jesus has promised sometime to return to the world of his terminal bestowal, the World of the Cross. <a id="a37_552"></a>[UB 119:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_8)

> Although Jesus did not die this death on the cross to atone for the racial guilt of mortal man nor to provide some sort of effective approach to an otherwise offended and unforgiving God; even though the Son of Man did not offer himself as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of God and to open the way for sinful man to obtain salvation; notwithstanding that these ideas of atonement and propitiation are erroneous, nonetheless, there are significances attached to this death of Jesus on the cross which should not be overlooked. It is a fact that Urantia has become known among other neighboring inhabited planets as the “World of the Cross.” <a id="a39_644"></a>[UB 188:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_1)

I make reference to this planet being known as the “World of the Cross” in my etymology of _Urantia_ and with respect to many other coined words. If such a reference is not included, this should not be taken as an intentional omission. Generally speaking, perhaps, we can always consider this as an etymological expression, given the context.

## All etymologies alphabetically organized

### abandonters

<a id="a47_0"></a>[UB 37:9.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p9_12) These first order citizens (a) are completely devoted to (abandon) to the masterful (don) perfection (t) of their role (ers).

_a:_ first order; first letter of the Roman alphabet, based on Greek alpha (see alpha).

_abandon_: from Old French abandonner “surrender, release; give freely, permit,” also reflexive, “devote (oneself)” (12c.). The Old French word was formed from the adverbial phrase à bandon “at will, at discretion,” from à “at, to” (from Latin ad; see ad-) + bandon “power, jurisdiction,” from Latin bannum, “proclamation,” which is from a Frankish or other Germanic word, from Proto-Germanic \*bannan- “proclaim, summon, outlaw” (things all done by proclamation). Etymologically, the word carries a sense of “put (something) under someone else’s control,” and the earliest appearance of the word in English is as an adverb (mid-13c.) with the sense “under (one’s) control,” hence also “unrestricted.” In Old French, the past-participle adjective abandoné came to mean “zealous, eager, unreserved.”

_don:_ (noun): 1520s, from Sp. or Port. don, title of respect, from L. dominus “lord, master.” The university sense is c.1660, originally student slang; underworld sense is 1952, from It. don, from L.L. domnus, from L. dominus (see domain). The fem. form is Dona (Spanish/Portuguese), Donna (Italian).

_t:_ To _cross one’s t’s_ (and _dot one’s i’s_) “to be exact” is attested from 1849. Phrase _to a T_ “exactly, with utmost exactness” is recorded from 1690s, though the exact signification remains uncertain despite much speculation.

_\-er:_ English agent noun ending, corresponding to Latin _\-or_. In native words it represents Old English _\-ere_ (Old Northumbrian also _\-are_) “man who has to do with,” from Proto-Germanic _\-ari_ (cognates: German _\-er_, Swedish _\-are_, Danish _\-ere_), from Proto-Germanic _\-arjoz_. Some believe this root is identical with, and perhaps a borrowing of, Latin _\-arius_ (see _\-ary_).

### agondonters

<a id="a61_0"></a>[UB 50:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_2) It’s all about the mental struggle for victory (agon) at the masters level (don)(t) for these “gamers” (ters).

_agony:_ late 14c., “mental suffering” (especially that of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane), from O.Fr. agonie, agoine “anguish, terror, death agony” (14c.), and directly from L.L. agonia, from Gk. agonia “a (mental) struggle for victory,” originally “a struggle for victory in the games,” from agon “assembly for a contest,” from agein “to lead” (see act (n.)). Sense of “extreme bodily suffering” first recorded c.1600.

_don:_ (noun): 1520s, from Sp. or Port. don, title of respect, from L. dominus “lord, master.” The university sense is c.1660, originally student slang; underworld sense is 1952, from It. don, from L.L. domnus, from L. dominus (see domain). The fem. form is Dona (Spanish/Portuguese), Donna (Italian).

_\-er:_ English agent noun ending, corresponding to Latin _\-or_.

His arrival was the signal for the establishment of the broadcast service of the universe of universes. Theretofore only the broadcasts of the superuniverses and the local universes had been in operation, but the announcement of the arrival of Grandfanda at the portals of Havona signalized the inauguration of the “space reports of glory,” so named because the initial universe broadcast reported the Havona arrival of the first of the evolutionary beings to attain entrance upon the goal of ascendant existence.

<a id="a299_0"></a>[UB 15:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_5)  _Jerusem,_ the headquarters of your local system of Satania, has its seven worlds of transition culture, each of which is encircled by seven satellites, among which are the seven mansion worlds of morontia detention, man’s first postmortal residence. As the term heaven has been used on Urantia, it has sometimes meant these seven mansion worlds, the first mansion world being denominated the first heaven, and so on to the seventh.

Etymology by Chris Halvorson: “the “new Jerusalem” ([Rev:21.2](/en/Bible/Revelation/21#v2)).

Identical with _lay_ (n) as “that which is set or established.”

_nadir (n.):_ late 14c., in astronomy, “imaginary point of the celestial sphere vertically opposite to the zenith of the sun; the inferior pole of the horizon,” from Medieval Latin _nadir_, from Arabic _nazir_ “opposite to,” in _nazir as-samt_, literally “opposite direction,” from _nazir_ “opposite” + _as-samt_ “road, path.” Transferred sense of “lowest point” of anything is recorded by 1793.
Metaphorically speaking, the zenith heads to heaven and the nadir heads to hell.

_forge (v):_ 1769 (with an apparent isolated use from 1610s), “make way, move ahead,” of unknown origin, perhaps an alteration of _force_ (v.), but perhaps rather from _forge_ (n.), via notion of steady hammering at something. Originally nautical, in reference to vessels.

Now only as a deliberate archaism. _Jest_ (n.) is the same word, with a decayed sense.

_tone (n.):_ mid-14c., “musical sound or note,” from Old French _ton_ “musical sound, speech, words” (13c.) and directly from Latin _tonus_ “a sound, tone, accent,” literally “stretching” (in Medieval Latin, a term peculiar to music), from Greek _tonos_ “vocal pitch, raising of voice, accent, key in music,” originally “a stretching, tightening, taut string,” related to _teinein_ “to stretch,” from PIE root _ten-_ “to stretch.” Sense of “manner of speaking” is from c. 1600.

_don (n.):_ title of respect, 1520s, from Spanish or Portuguese _Don_, a title of respect prefixed to a man’s Christian name, from Latin _dominus_ “lord, master, owner” (from _domus_ “house,” from PIE root \*dem- “house, household”).

### Nodite

_Nod:_ “Nod” (נוד) is the Hebrew root of the verb “to wander” (לנדוד). Therefore, to dwell in the land of Nod can mean to live a wandering life. The Land of Nod (Hebrew: אֶרֶץ־נוֹד – ʾereṣ-Nōḏ) is a place mentioned in the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible, located “on the east of Eden” (qiḏmaṯ-ʿḖḏen), where Cain was exiled by God after Cain had murdered his brother Abel.

And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

_\-ite:_ word-forming element indicating origin or derivation from, from French –_ite_ and directly from Latin –_ita_, from Greek –_ites_ (fem. -itis), word-forming element making adjectives and nouns meaning “connected with or belonging to.” Especially used in classical times to form ethnic and local designations (for example in Septuagint translations of Hebrew names in –_i_) and for names of gems and minerals.

_“v” for victory:_ [**1 John 5:**](/en/Bible/1_John/5) <sup><small>1</sup></small> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. <sup><small>2</sup></small> This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. <sup><small>3</sup></small> In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands.

This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. <sup><small>5</sup></small> Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.

_on (prep., adv.):_ “in a position above and in contact with; in such a position as to be supported by;” also noting the goal to which some action is or has been directed; “about, concerning, regarding; in a position to cover;” as an adverb, “in or into a position in contact with and supported by the top or upper part of something; in or into place; in place for use or action; into movement or action; in operation,” Old English _on_, unstressed variant of _an_ “in, on, into,” from Proto-Germanic _\*ana_ “on” (source also of Dutch _aan_, German _an_, Gothic _ana_ “on, upon”), from PIE root _\*an-_ (1) “on” (source also of Avestan _ana_ “on,” Greek _ana_ “on, upon,” Latin _an-_, Old Church Slavonic _na_, Lithuanian _nuo_“down from”).

<a id="a530_0"></a>[UB 41:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p2_1) No need for secondhand religion here (Rant); they have all they need and are way beyond that (ul) in these parts of the universe (ia).

From Wikipedia: The Ranters were one of a number of dissenting groups that emerged around the time of the English Commonwealth (1649–1660). They were largely common people and there is plenty of evidence that the movement was widespread throughout England, though they were not organised and had no leader. … The Ranters denied the authority of churches, of scripture, of the current ministry and of services, instead calling on men to listen to the divine within them. In many ways they resemble the 14th century Brethren of the Free Spirit. In fact, they were causing such controversy, that by the early 1650’s multiple anti-Ranter pamphlets were circulating throughout Britain.

_\-ulent:_ word-forming element meaning “full of, abounding in,” from Latin adjective suffix _\-ulentus_ “full of.”

_ultra-_ word-forming element meaning “beyond” (_ultraviolet_) or “extremely” (_ultramodern_), from Latin _ultra-_ from _ultra_ (adv. and prep.) “beyond, on the other side, on the farther side, past, over, across,” from PIE _ol-tero-_, suffixed form of root _al-_ “beyond.” In common use from early 19c., it appears to have arisen from French political designations.

The living example (R) of a reason to mix genetic ratios (Rat) that were previously religiously restricted (ta).

_rationalize:_ “explain in a rational way, make conformable to reason,” from rational + -ize. The psychological sense of “to give an explanation that conceals true motives” dates from 1922, on the notion of “cause to appear reasonable or socially acceptable.” In 19c. Newman and Browning also used it with an intransitive sense of “think for oneself, employ one’s reason as the supreme test.”

_ratio:_ 1630s, “reason, rationale,” from L. ratio “reckoning, calculation, business affair, procedure,” also “reason,” from rat-, pp. stem of reri “to reckon, calculate,” also “think” (see reason). Mathematical sense is attested from 1660.”

_rational:_ late 14c., “pertaining to reason;” mid-15c., “endowed with reason,” from L. rationalis “of or belonging to reason, reasonable,” from ratio (gen. rationis) “reckoning, calculation, reason.”

_taboo:_ also tabu, 1777 (in Cook’s “A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean”), “consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed,” explained in some English sources as being from Tongan (Polynesian language of the island of Tonga) ta-bu “sacred,” from ta “mark” + bu “especially.” But this may be folk etymology, as linguists in the Pacific have reconstructed an irreducable Proto-Polynesian \*tapu, from Proto-Oceanic \*tabu “sacred, forbidden” (compare Hawaiian kapu “taboo, prohibition, sacred, holy, consecrated;” Tahitian tapu “restriction, sacred, devoted; an oath;” Maori tapu “be under ritual restriction, prohibited”). The noun and verb are English innovations first recorded in Cook’s book.

_ta_: A slang word for Thanks. The word is a result of the heavy Danish influence on the English language. English has Danish and Jutland roots. The Danish word for Thanks is tak. In Scotland and upper England it was common to drop the k at the end because of the way words were pronounced during the time of old English and Middle English. Hence the slang word “Ta” which should actually be pronounced “TA-k” but over time became “Ta” is really Tak meaning “Thanks.”
