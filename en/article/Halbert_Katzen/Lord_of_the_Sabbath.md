***Sabbath*** etymology: Old English, from Latin _sabbatum_, via Greek from Hebrew _šabbāṯ_, from _šāḇaṯ_ ‘to rest’ or ‘to cease’.

## From _The Urantia Book_:

Interestingly enough, the words _Lord_ and _Sabbath_ appear in the same paragraph in _The Urantia Book_ on three occasions:

> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.” [Isaiah 66:22-23](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66#v22) ([UB 52:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_12))

> As Jesus taught in the synagogue this Sabbath afternoon, according to custom he took the first text from the law, reading from the Book of Exodus: “And you shall serve the Lord, your God, and he shall bless your bread and your water, and all sickness shall be taken away from you.” He chose the second text from the Prophets, reading from Isaiah: “Arise and shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Darkness may cover the earth and gross darkness the people, but the spirit of the Lord shall arise upon you, and the divine glory shall be seen with you. Even the gentiles shall come to this light, and many great minds shall surrender to the brightness of this light.” ([UB 145:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p2_2))

> But the spies did not have long to wait for their opportunity to accuse Jesus and his associates of Sabbath breaking. As the company passed along the narrow road, the waving wheat, which was just then ripening, was near at hand on either side, and some of the apostles, being hungry, plucked the ripe grain and ate it. It was customary for travelers to help themselves to grain as they passed along the road, and therefore no thought of wrongdoing was attached to such conduct. But the spies seized upon this as a pretext for assailing Jesus. When they saw Andrew rub the grain in his hand, they went up to him and said: “Do you not know that it is unlawful to pluck and rub the grain on the Sabbath day?” And Andrew answered: “But we are hungry and rub only sufficient for our needs; and since when did it become sinful to eat grain on the Sabbath day?” But the Pharisees answered: “You do no wrong in eating, but you do break the law in plucking and rubbing out the grain between your hands; surely your Master would not approve of such acts.” Then said Andrew: “But if it is not wrong to eat the grain, surely the rubbing out between our hands is hardly more work than the chewing of the grain, which you allow; wherefore do you quibble over such trifles?” When Andrew intimated that they were quibblers, they were indignant, and rushing back to where Jesus walked along, talking to Matthew, they protested, saying: “Behold, Teacher, your apostles do that which is unlawful on the Sabbath day; they pluck, rub, and eat the grain. We are sure you will command them to cease.” And then said Jesus to the accusers: “You are indeed zealous for the law, and you do well to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; but did you never read in the Scripture that, one day when David was hungry, he and they who were with him entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for anyone to eat save the priests? and David also gave this bread to those who were with him. And have you not read in our law that it is lawful to do many needful things on the Sabbath day? And shall I not, before the day is finished, see you eat that which you have brought along for the needs of this day? My good men, you do well to be zealous for the Sabbath, but you would do better to guard the health and well-being of your fellows. I declare that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. And if you are here present with us to watch my words, then will I openly proclaim that the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” ([UB 147:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p6_4))

Here are some selections from Paper 164: At The Feast Of Dedication, Section 3: Heal The Blind Beggar.

> The next morning the three went over to Martha’s home at Bethany for breakfast and then went immediately into Jerusalem. This Sabbath morning, as Jesus and his two apostles drew near the temple, they encountered a well-known beggar, a man who had been born blind, sitting at his usual place. Although these mendicants did not solicit or receive alms on the Sabbath day, they were permitted thus to sit in their usual places. Jesus paused and looked upon the beggar. As he gazed upon this man who had been born blind, the idea came into his mind as to how he would once more bring his mission on earth to the notice of the Sanhedrin and the other Jewish leaders and religious teachers.   . . . ([UB 164:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_1))

> Jesus decided to use this beggar in his plans for that day’s work, but before doing anything for the blind man, Josiah by name, he proceeded to answer Nathaniel’s question. Said the Master: “Neither did this man sin nor his parents that the works of God might be manifest in him. This blindness has come upon him in the natural course of events, but we must now do the works of Him who sent me, while it is still day, for the night will certainly come when it will be impossible to do the work we are about to perform. When I am in the world, I am the light of the world, but in only a little while I will not be with you.” ([UB 164:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_7))

> When Jesus had spoken, he said to Nathaniel and Thomas: “Let us create the sight of this blind man on this Sabbath day that the scribes and Pharisees may have the full occasion which they seek for accusing the Son of Man.” Then, stooping over, he spat on the ground and mixed the clay with the spittle, and speaking of all this so that the blind man could hear, he went up to Josiah and put the clay over his sightless eyes, saying: “Go, my son, wash away this clay in the pool of Siloam, and immediately you shall receive your sight.” And when Josiah had so washed in the pool of Siloam, he returned to his friends and family, seeing.   . . . ([UB 164:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_8))

> Jesus gave this man his sight by miraculous working, on this Sabbath morning and in Jerusalem near the temple, for the prime purpose of making this act an open challenge to the Sanhedrin and all the Jewish teachers and religious leaders. This was his way of proclaiming an open break with the Pharisees. He was always positive in everything he did. And it was for the purpose of bringing these matters before the Sanhedrin that Jesus brought his two apostles to this man early in the afternoon of this Sabbath day and deliberately provoked those discussions which compelled the Pharisees to take notice of the miracle. ([UB 164:3.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_16))

> Then Josiah, standing upon a stool, shouted abroad to all who could hear, saying: “Hearken, you who claim to be the teachers of all Israel, while I declare to you that herein is a great marvel since you confess that you know not whence this man is, and yet you know of a certainty, from the testimony which you have heard, that he opened my eyes. We all know that God does not perform such works for the ungodly; that God would do such a thing only at the request of a true worshiper—for one who is holy and righteous. You know that not since the beginning of the world have you ever heard of the opening of the eyes of one who was born blind. Look, then, all of you, upon me and realize what has been done this day in Jerusalem! I tell you, if this man were not from God, he could not do this.” And as the Sanhedrists departed in anger and confusion, they shouted to him: “You were altogether born in sin, and do you now presume to teach us? Maybe you were not really born blind, and even if your eyes were opened on the Sabbath day, this was done by the power of the prince of devils.” And they went at once to the synagogue to cast out Josiah. ([UB 164:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p4_11))

## From the Bible

_Lord of the Sabbath_ is mentioned in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Below is one example. The Wikipedia reference below for _Lord of the Sabbath_ has links to the other passages.

**Matthew 12:**

_Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath_

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.
> <sup><small>5</sup></small>  Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?
> <sup><small>6</sup></small>  I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’you would not have condemned the innocent.
> <sup><small>8</sup></small>  For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
> <sup><small>9</sup></small>  Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
> <sup><small>12</sup></small>  How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
> <sup><small>13</sup></small>  Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.
> <sup><small>14</sup></small>  But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. [Matthew 12](/en/Bible/Matthew/12)

_God’s Chosen Servant_

> <sup><small>15</sup></small>  Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill.
> <sup><small>16</sup></small>  He warned them not to tell others about him.
> <sup><small>17</sup></small>  This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
> <sup><small>18</sup></small>  “Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. (KJV:  . . . and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.)
> <sup><small>19</sup></small>  He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
> <sup><small>20</sup></small>  A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.
> <sup><small>21</sup></small>  In his name the nations will put their hope.” (KJV: And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.) [Matthew 12](/en/Bible/Matthew/12)

### Select passages related to the Lord as the provider of _Sabbath_ (_rest)_.

**Matthew 11:**

> <sup><small>28</sup></small>  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
> <sup><small>29</sup></small>  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
> <sup><small>30</sup></small>  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. [Matthew 11](/en/Bible/Matthew/11)

**Hebrews 4:**

> <sup><small>1</sup></small>  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
> <sup><small>2</sup></small>  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
> <sup><small>3</sup></small>  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
> <sup><small>4</sup></small>  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
> <sup><small>5</sup></small>  And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
> <sup><small>6</sup></small>  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
> <sup><small>7</sup></small>  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
> <sup><small>8</sup></small>  For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
> <sup><small>9</sup></small>  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
> <sup><small>10</sup></small>  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
> <sup><small>11</sup></small>  Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. [Hebrews 12](/en/Bible/Hebrews/4)

## From Wikipedia:

### [Lord of the Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Sabbath) page.

This page provides a brief summary of the issue. Here are the introductory remarks:

The **Lord of the Sabbath** is an expression describing [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus") which appears in all three [Synoptic Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_Gospel "Synoptic Gospel"), [Matthew 12:1-8](/en/Bible/Matthew/12#v1), [Mark 2:23-28](/en/Bible/Mark/2#v23) and [Luke 6:1-5](/en/Bible/Luke/6#v1). These sections each relate an encounter between Jesus, his [Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles "Apostles") and the [Pharisees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees "Pharisees"), the first of the four “[Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath "Sabbath") controversies”.

### [Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat) page.

This page focuses on the Jewish religion’s relationship to the Sabbath and starts with this expanded etymology:

The word “Shabbat” derives from the Hebrew verb _shavat_ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): שָׁבַת). Although frequently translated as “rest” (noun or verb), another accurate translation of these words is “ceasing \[from work\]”, as resting is not necessarily denoted. The related modern Hebrew word _shevita_ ([labor strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_strike "Labor strike")), has the same implication of active rather than passive abstinence from work. The notion of active cessation from labor is also regarded as more consistent with an [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotent "Omnipotent") [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism "Names of God in Judaism")‘s activity on the seventh day of [Creation according to Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative "Genesis creation narrative"). Other significant connotations are to _shevet_ (שֶּׁבֶת) which means sitting or staying, and to _sheva_ (שֶׁבַע) meaning seven, as Shabbat is the seventh day of the week; the other days of the week do not have names but called by their [ordinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number").

### _[Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath)_ page.

Below are some select excerpts:

\[Note: According to _The Urantia Book_, the 4000th anniversary of the arrival of Machiventa Melchizedek is 2021! See: [Prophecy and “signs of the times”/History of this Topical Study](https://ubannotated.com/main-menu/animated/topical-studies/prophecy-and-signs-of-the-times/#history).\]

**Millennial Sabbath**

_Main article: [Millennial Day Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennial_Day_Theory)_

Since [Hippolytus of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolytus_of_Rome) in the early third century, Christians have often considered that some thousand-year Sabbath, expected to begin six thousand years after Creation, might be identical with the [millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism) described in the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation). This view was also popular among 19th- and 20th-century [dispensational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) [premillennialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premillennialist). The term “Sabbatism” or “Sabbatizing” (Greek _Sabbatismos_), which generically means any literal or spiritual Sabbath-keeping, has also been taken in [Hebrews 4:9](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\(King_James\)/Hebrews#4:9) to have special reference to this definition.

**High Sabbaths**

_Main article: [High Sabbaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sabbaths)_

“High Sabbaths” are observed by Jews and some Christians. Seven annual Biblical festivals, called _miqra_ (“called assembly”) in Hebrew and “High Sabbath” in English and serving as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath, are specified in the books of [Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus) and [Deuteronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomy); they do not necessarily fall on weekly Sabbath. Three occur in spring: the first and seventh days of [Pesach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesach) ([Passover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_(Christian_holiday))), and [Shavuot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot) ([Pentecost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost)). Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called _Shabbaton_: [Rosh Hashanah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) ([Trumpets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_Trumpets_(Christian_holiday))); [Yom Kippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur), “Sabbath of Sabbaths” ([Atonement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_observances_of_Yom_Kippur)); and the first and eighth days of [Sukkoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkoth) ([Tabernacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_observances_of_Jewish_holidays#Feast_of_Tabernacles)). “High Sabbaths” is also often a synonym of “[High Holy Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holy_Days)“, viz., Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

**Shmita (Sabbath)**

_Further information: [Shmita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita)_

_Shmita_ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): שמטה, Strong’s 8059 as _sh<sup>e</sup>mittah_, literally “release”), also called sabbatical year, is the seventh (שביעי, Strong’s 7637 as _sh<sup>e</sup>biy’iy_) year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by [Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah) for the [Land of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel), relatively little observed in Biblical tradition, but still observed in contemporary [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism). During _Shmita_, the land is left to lie [fallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallow) and all agricultural activity, including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting, is forbidden by Torah and [Jewish law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha). By tradition, other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as preventative measures only, not to improve the growth of trees or plants; additionally, whatever fruits grow of their own accord during that year are deemed _hefker_ (ownerless), not for the landowner but for the poor, the stranger, and the beasts of the field; these fruits may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of _Shmita_ produce. When the year ended, all debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted ([Deuteronomy 15:1–11](/en/Bible/Deuteronomy/15#v1)); in similar fashion, Torah requires a slave who had worked for six years to go free in the seventh year. [Leviticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus) 25 promises bountiful harvests to those who observe _Shmita_, and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. The term _Shmita_ is translated “release” five times in the [Book of Deuteronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy) (from the root שמט, _shamat_, “_desist_, _remit_“, 8058).

**Spiritual Sabbath**

As another minority view, some modern Christians uphold Sabbath principles but do not limit observance to either Saturday or Sunday, instead advocating rest on any one chosen day of the week as following the spirit of Sabbath, or advocating Sabbath as instead a symbolic metaphor for rest in Christ. These look upon Sabbath as a principle to be observed in spirit rather than in letter, regarding the rest offered in [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) as the only New Testament admonishment containing the root word of “Sabbath” ([Matthew 11:28](/en/Bible/Matthew/11#v28)) and sometimes as a more permanent rest than a day could fulfill ([Hebrews 4:9](/en/Bible/Hebrews/4#v9)).

**Babylonian rest days**

_Main articles: [Babylonian calendar § Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar#Days), and [Shappatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shappatum)_

Counting from the [new moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon), the Babylonians celebrated the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th as “holy-days”, also called “evil days” (meaning “unsuitable” for prohibited activities). On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to “make a wish”, and at least the 28th was known as a “rest-day”. On each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess. Tablets from the 6th-century BCE reigns of [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) and [Cambyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses) indicate these dates were sometimes approximate. The [lunation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunation) of 29 or 30 days basically contained three [seven-day weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-day_week), and a final week of nine or ten days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle.
