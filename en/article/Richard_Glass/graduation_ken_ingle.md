_(Editor’s note: Ken Ingle of the Lone Star Urantia Association (LSUA) in Texas passed away on Saturday, 2<sup>nd</sup> February at the age of 85. Following is an account of his life by his good friend, Richard Glass)_

![](https://urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ken-Ingle-1-150x150.jpg)

As real lover of life, Ken’s example of defining his own life was a good goal for any personality. He became a self-created, award-winning, science-fiction novelist heralded and acclaimed by sci-fi loving groups at UTA and other locations in the state and nation. Ken hosted a study group for many years. He had a wide variety of world interests which included his family, maintaining his health and vitality, sports, science, and his passion for science-fiction writing.

I was very happy when Ken first contacted me in the 1980s to inquire about the book and its study in the area. I was living in Fort Worth and he in Arlington at the time. It was shortly thereafter that he decided to host a study group on Pebble Way that kept going and growing, having its ups and downs, and sometimes serving as a venue for introducing some prospective readers to the Good News—to Better News than anyone initially expects.

I also want to record my appreciation and gratitude to Ken for virtually single-handedly re-vitalizing the Lone Star Urantia Association when he was serving as its Vice President, an action which eventually led to the historical and noteworthy event of the San Antonio Urantia Conference of 2016. This was the very first inter-organizational and cooperatively planned conference with input and support from Urantia Foundation, the Urantia Book Fellowship, Urantia Association International, Truthbook, and LSUA. This event, in part, can be attributed to Ken’s initiative in making sure that, as he retired as Vice President of Lone Star, a new team of officers with a new vision, determination, and resourcefulness had been organized to bring into being a new association.

Overall, I will continue to admire and revere Ken’s initiative, spunk, and self-determination to create a new career for himself as a successful author, his success in finding a surgeon he could trust to perform the cranial surgery he needed a few years ago, his ongoing interest in leading-edge science, and his loyalty in keeping a study group going in his apartment for many years. I think his long-term contribution to the Urantia community will prove to have been his reforms in the Lone Star Urantia Association, which eventually led to very significant progress in the leadership of the entire readership.

Best wishes, Ken, as you take on the great challenges and adventures that lie ahead!
