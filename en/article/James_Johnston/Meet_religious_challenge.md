To meet the religious challenge of this age it would first seem appropriate to distinguish between a religious and non-religious philosophy of living — the difference being in the nature of level of recognized values and in the object of loyalties, as pointed out by a Melchizedek: “_There are four phases in the evolution of religious philosophy: Such as experience may become merely conformative, resigned to submission to tradition and authority. Or it may be satisfied with slight attainments, just enough to stabilize the daily living, and therefore becomes early arrested on such an adventitious level. Such mortals believe in letting well enough alone. A third group progress to the level of logical intellectuality but there stagnate in consequence of cultural slavery. It is indeed pitiful to behold giant intellects held so securely within the cruel grasp of cultural bondage. It is equally pathetic to observe those who trade their cultural bondage for the materialistic fetters of a science, falsely so called. The fourth level of philosophy attains freedom from all conventional and traditional handicaps and dares to think, act, and live honestly, loyally, fearlessly, and truthfully._” (<a id="a33_1202"></a>[UB 101:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_4)) The last sentence of this quote directly relates to the original question with regard to the construction of a “_...new and appealing philosophy of living..._” (<a id="a33_1408"></a>[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10)). Both quotes use the verb dare which implies that the religous teachers of this age must have sufficient. courage to implement this fourth level of philosophy.

Once it is determined that a religious philosophy of living is what the authors intend by their challenge, we can test it experientially as pointed out by this same Melchizedek: “_The acid test for any religious philosophy consists in whether or not it distinguishes between the realities of the material and the spiritual worlds while at the same moment recognizing their unification in intellectual striving and in social serving._” (<a id="a35_436"></a>[UB 101:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p7_5)) This is further highlighted. “_The highest attainable philosophy of mortal man must be logically based upon the reason of science, the faith of religion, and the truth insight afforded by revelation._” (<a id="a35_684"></a>[UB 103:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_15))

The folly of adhering strictly to a non-religious philosophy of living is expressed strongly: “_To build a philosophy of the universe on an exclusive materialism is to ignore the fact that all things material are initially conceived as real in the experience of human consciousness._” (<a id="a37_286"></a>[UB 112:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_12))

In the paper on “_Government on a Neighboring Planet,_” it was deemed important enough to pass on to us the view of those on the most advanced continent. “_In their philosophy, religion is the striving to know God and to manifest love for one's fellows through service for them..._” (<a id="a39_284"></a>[UB 72:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_5))

This is pointed out in another way in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount ordination charge, “_An effective philosophy of living is formed by a combination of cosmic insight and the total 'of one's emotional reactions to the social and economic environment._” (<a id="a41_252"></a>[UB 140:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_8))

One would expect men and women of universe insight to construct their philosophy of living relationships with others to be based upon the golden rule. “_Still others look upon it [the golden rule] as being the positive injunction of a great moral teacher who embodied in this statement the highest concept of moral obligations as regards all fraternal relationships. In the lives of such moral beings the golden rule becomes the wise center and circumference of all their philosophy._” (<a id="a43_487"></a>[UB 180:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_6)) Then, “_... this golden rule takes on living qualities of spiritual realization on those higher levels of interpretation which cause the mortal sons of God to view the injunction of the Master as requiring them so to relate themselves to their fellows that they will receive the highest good as a result of the believer's contact with them._” (<a id="a43_876"></a>[UB 180:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_7))

In conclusion, the true children of spiritual discernment will continue to unify their personality around a religious philosophy of living. The religious teachers of this age will muster the necessary courage in order to think, act, and live honestly, loyally, fearlessly, and truthfully. By doing this we will be able to live the golden rule in such a way as to relate ourselves to our fellows so that our contact with them will insure that they receive the highest good from us. By embracing this type of philosophy we are recognizing the different realities of the spiritual and material worlds and unifying them in our personal intellectual striving and our social service. The spirit-led teachers today are committed to the adaption of their philosophy to the individual requirements and capacity of those with whom they come into contact by constantly adjusting these living relationships in accordance with the leading of the Spirit of Truth.
