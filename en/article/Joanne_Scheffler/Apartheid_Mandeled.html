<p>Apartheid Mandeled
Joanne Scheffler, Gold Coast, Australia</p>
<p>“A miracle unfolded; A Good Man;” These were the words I read as I picked up the newspaper following the election of Nelson Mandela to be president of South Africa.</p>
<p>Having been one of many pessimistic people predicting bloodshed, revolution, general doom and gloom I was more than overwhelmed when none of this happened and I was so privileged to witness a great chapter in social evolution.</p>
<p>As I furiously read the article, tears of joy occasioned my cheek, I wanted to know—How was this possible? One man, they say, is accredited with the peaceful outcome to date. The painful process of unity. Black and white hugging and kissing in the street. White and black politicians working together for the good of all—as though a newly found freedom was given to them, permission to do those things which we inherently know to be right but through culture, beliefs, fear, we do create anger where there could be tolerance, fear where there could be love. As I read on, I almost hear the relief of the people saying thank you for giving us permission to understand, or at least to try to understand, our black, blue, brindle brothers and sisters. It may not be easy but we are prepared to try.</p>
<p>I read on. I want to know how this one man gave this permission. What secrets did he hold? Did he use magic? Was he to be trusted? Why did these people, so many people, unquestioningly respond with such positive, peaceful, fearless courage to do the so-called “impossible.”</p>
<p>In descriptions of him, they use words like “caring.” He takes time out to phone the wife of a white journalist killed in a car crash. Listens and gives empathic support for 45 minutes or so and later asks a friend of hers at a rally how she is faring.1</p>
<p>They describe his “bossiness” as beguiling rather than offensive. While addressing a large crowd at an election rally, he notices that a marshall was behaving a bit roughly with an excited boy. He broke off from his speech and said, &quot;No, marshall, stop it! That’s no way to treat a child and then gave orders to bring all children to the front out of the crush.</p>
<p>“Kind” and “forgiving” are frequently used.2 He writes not one bad word about his predecessors (his so-called enemies), his jailers.3 “Let bygones be bygones,” he says, inviting all these people to celebrate his presidency, and referring to them with kindness, sincerity, and, most of all, genuine forgiveness.</p>
<p>He neither drinks, smokes, nor swears. He expresses anger at a certain group at a rally who were firing shots into the air. He says, “I must take the strongest offence at this behavior of these individuals,” which provoked fits of giggles from the crowd—also having the desired effect on the offenders. They cease.</p>
<p>He declares at a rally that, “he loves each person there”— the strange thing is that you believe it. He helps reporters carry their heavy equipment, especially that used by a female journalist, to where he himself will be interviewed.4 The list is endless.</p>
<p>So in summary:
A man of great integrity, sincere, honest.
A man of forgiveness, genuine.
A man always happy and smiling.5</p>
<p>Are these how we would describe any of our politicians today, or anyone else for that matter?</p>
<p>I have heard these words before. These and more describe to me the man/god who walked the earth 2000 years ago. He said, “I am the way.”</p>
<p>Today we have a great example of how the teachings of Jesus—doing as he would have done—has healed, or has helped to heal, a very volatile situation. What they now do with this, we will see.</p>
<p>Thank you, Nelson Mandela, for showing us, once again, what can be achieved when we do as Jesus would have done. The possibilities are endless. The manual is written. All we have to do is to start acting out the behavior of Jesus instead of just talking and reading about what he did—get out there and show the way!</p>
