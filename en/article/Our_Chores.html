Dedicate your life to demonstrating the combined human affection and divine dignity of the God-knowing mortal.

As far as is in your power live long on earth that your life of many years may be fruitful in souls won for God's kingdom.

To those who are God-knowing there is no such thing as common labor or secular toil. All honest earthly labor is sacred and is a service--even to God our Father.

But learn that even the expression of a good thought may need to be modulated in accordance with the understanding of the hearer. And neglect not to minister to the needy, the poor, the young. Bon voyage.

*****************

That concludes our examples of attempting to fulfil the edicts of that page 43 request to produce a new and righteous vision of morality. The foundation of such a vision would surely need to be that we love all men regardless of what they are like. The secret in being able to do so is in the words:

“If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love.” (1098)

An academic-style philosophical work of the intensity of even the Urantia revelation seems unlikely to achieve sufficient popularity to be effective. A novel with no religious connotations but a central character who does just that possibly could do so.

An alternative is thousands of minor, short works, articles, web sites, etc. all attempting the task and overcoming the handicaps through sheer quantity and persistence.

But primarily, we must live as Jesus lived.
