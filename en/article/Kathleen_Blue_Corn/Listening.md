I have recently been exposed to Six-O-Six through my friends Sananda and White Cloud. I want to express my appreciation for your efforts to promote international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

I am also writing to extend my support to you for printing the articles regarding our new Planetary Prince, the Caligastia visit and any others about the Planetary Center of Light.

I can imagine the potential ripples of reaction which might be triggered by these articles. I trust readers of _The URANTIA Book_ will call upon the many tools given for discerning truth, for recognizing and comprehending multi-dimensional concepts and for responding to major transitions with as much inner serenity and balanced inner essence as one is capable of mustering.

As we develop into a planetary community, I feel we must take the time to build into our regional meetings a grounded capacity for listening to and evaluating in a relaxed manner the many claims which are coming forth.

For what it's worth, I have known Sananda and White Cloud for 17 years. For as long as I have known them they have been teaching quality classes on _The URANTIA Book_ and have always acted towards me with the greatest integrity.

I have absolute faith in their exciting developments with our Planetary Prince and with Master Lao-Tse. I have seen Machiventa's and Lao-Tse's faces shining with beauty, compassion and wisdom in the space which normally holds Sananda's face, and encourage us all to consult first the Spirit of Truth within our own hearts before we consult our minds. These are truly challenging times, momentous times with miracles occurring in graceful procession. May the way be opened for a balanced response to all that which is true straight through to the core, and may we be at least a portion as merciful towards one another as our loving Creator is towards us.
