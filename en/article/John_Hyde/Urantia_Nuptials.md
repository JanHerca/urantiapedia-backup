_Reported by John Hyde, Richardson, Texas_

> “Of all social relations calculated to develop character, the most effective and ideal is the affectionate and understanding friendship of man and roman in the mutual embrace of wedlock. Marriage, with its manifold relations, is best designed to draw forth those precious impulses and those higher motives wohich are indispensable to the development of a strong character.” (Rodan) <a id="a14_384"></a>[UB 160:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_6)

Those ideals and aspirations were markedly expressed in the early summer, 1991 at ceremonies uniting Dianne Trouy and Terry Matheny in Texas, Karen Johnson and Tom Allen in Oklahoma, and Joan Batson and Larry Mullins in Colorado.

Typical of the three ceremonies, all individually written by the couples and based upon teachings of _The Urantia Book_, was that of Terry and Dianne, who announced in the invitation that “On this day I will marry my friend, the one who shares my dreams, life and love.” Onlookers followed the ceremony with printed programs which explained that the flowers and music “express the beauty and joy of God's presence.” To symbolize continuity, each family escorted the honoree, entering from opposite sides to signify continuity of family and civilizations produced by marriage, as well as the differences brought by each person to the union. In the outdoor setting, flanked by family and friends gathered in front of a picturesque wishing well, the couple vowed to each other:

> “I will encourage your growth as a child of God by nurturing your noblest of virtues, while lovingly, I shall afford you transgressions and missteps along our eternal path to the Father. While giving to you the consideration and kindness which is your due, I shall yet offer you the comfort and familiar understanding of our claseness. I will respect you as an individual, separate and unique, never striving to make of you a reflection of myself. While I shall never block the path in front of you, nor fall into the shadow left behind you, I shall evermore walk beside you as your companion and your support. I will not forsake you in times of trial and hardship. I promise to you now, my loyalty and faithfulness, both as your partner in marriage and your friend in God. I roill remain with you to the end of our days to share in the joys and fruits of our lives together. As we grow in wisdom and years, we shall grow together and our days shall be filled with love.”

Following affirmation of the vows, the minister asked for acknowledgement and acceptance by the community, explaining that “Marriage is societal as well as personal . . . aiding in the progress of civilization as well as the individual's spiritual growth.” The couple then exchanged rings as a physical symbol of the union and signed contracts to signify “respect for civil society and agreement between the two mature, responsible persons.” Each offered wine to the other, indicating a readiness “to share in the rewards as well as the difficulties of marriage.” The ceremony concluded with an invitation to celebrate in expressing “willingness to open their hearts and home to all, thereby embracing the Family of Man.”

Larry Bowan of Oklahoma City reports that "Two conferences six years apart at the Franciscan Renewal Center in Phoenix were the occasions for introductions which culminated in a wedding in Oklahoma City in May, 1991. Among the people whom Tom Allen of Oklahoma met in 1982 at the first Arizona gathering for readers of _The Urantia Book_ were Dick and Peggy Johnson of Phoenix. "Six years later, at a second conference, Tom met the Johnson's daughter, Karen. The grounds of Harry McMullan's beautiful home in Oklahoma City was the setting for an outdoor ceremony, attended by more than 100 guests from the Sooner State and from Japan, Arizona, Texas, Arkansas, Illinois, and Minnesota. After exchange of the couple's original vows, they were pronounced one.

Carol Hay of Boulder, Colorado, always a welcome entertainer at Urantia gatherings, reports that the union of Joan Batson and Larry Mullins began in a beautiful outdoor setting to the strains of Star Edwards at the harp and a magnificent backdrop of scenic Rocky Mountains. Dr. Meredith Sprunger presided at the ceremony, with the bride in Victorian lace, Michelle Mullins as a charming flower girl, and James and Claire Hay bearing the rings. The Banner of Michael of Nebadon dominated the scene. But, alas, reports Carol, “as best man, Herb Sperber, scrambled to catch a runaway wedding band, we began to sense that things were going to go awry in Paradise.” The skies began to darken, tiny drops of rain began to fall on the idyllic setting, Dr. Sprunger began to pick up his pace. The ceremony concluded with John Hay's friendly umbrella held over the happy couple. “And besides,” concludes Carol, “having it rain in 40 degree temperature on your wedding is the kind of thing that memories are made of!” Or, as our book reminds us, “. . . man and woman in the fond embrace of the highest ideals of time, is so valuable and satisfying an experience that it is worth any price, any sacrifice, requisite for its possession.”
