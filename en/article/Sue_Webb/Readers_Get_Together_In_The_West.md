As some readers would know we held a get-together over here in W.A. on the weekend of the 19th — 20th August. The venue was Fairbridge Village, a one hour drive south of Perth.

All told 11 people attended, 5 arriving on the Friday evening, the rest intermittently on the Saturday.

Will, Pete and myself arrived a little late and were greeted by Margaret and Pam, frantically trying to get the fire started. Will, being the old bushie that he is, sorted that out. With fire blazing and no time to waste it was straight into a study group session. The Paper on Personality Survival was chosen, which led to some interesting conversation as Pam and Margaret were devout reincarnationists. We continued on that theme the next day.

Saturday morning after breakfast Phil Allen arrived. Phil is a long-time reader of _The URANTIA Book_ and a one time member of Peter Toy's study group in Perth. Next to arrive was John Mander, also a believer in reincarnation. It was reincarnation versus incarnation with more reading on Personality Survival. This took us to lunch, after which a video entitled “The Great Adventure” (produced by the Oklahoma U.B. Society) was shown. Next Phil gave a talk on his ideas concerning _The URANTIA Book_ and its important role in the 20th century. Unfortunately Phil left soon after to rejoin his family in Perth. John also departed soon after.

Last, but by no means 1east, Rick and Sandie Bruce and their children arrived from Busselton. They have both been students of _The URANTIA Book_ for some years. Pete and I briefly met Rick for the first time earlier in the year. It was good to catch up with Rick and to meet Sandie.

More video displays after tea. Then Pete suggested for the next morning we'd all choose a paper we were interested in and give a 10 minute talk.

The next morning Pete began with the Paper on the dinosaur era. Next I read on the Reality of Religious Experience, Sandie chose a passage on Jesus and a discussion with the disciples. Pam read on the importance of woman's role in the Jesus' papers. Will on the importance of socializing religion and Rick on evolution.

We finished off the morning in the village church, accompanied by three Christians. The service was conducted by ourselves with Rev. Will starting off with a reading from the book of Corinthians. Pete read Psalm 23, and our Christian friends contributed with a short story. Pan, being a onetime member of a church choir,led us in song and tried valiantly to keep us in tune as we sang a few hymns. We concluded the service with The Lord's Prayer.

After lunch it was time to clean up and load the car. We then listened to Will giving us a brief explanation on the function of the URANTIA Foundation and Brotherhood.

Reluctant farewells were bid with a promise to meet again in a few months. Everyone agreed that the weekend was a great success.
