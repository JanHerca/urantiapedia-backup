Who told you <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that my revelation had ended? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that having spoken <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would speak no more?<br>
<br>
I tell you <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I shall speak to my children <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they have need of me.<br>

I shall not withhold my spirit <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from any of them, <br>
For I hear their cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I shall answer.<br>
It is good that you search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the records for my message,<br>
But you should not think <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I speak from them only,<br>
For my spirit lives within you <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I speak to you always.<br>

You know this in your heart.<br>
Listen then, to the spirit.<br>

How long will you look outside, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before you turn within?<br>
Do you hope to find me on a page? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or to discover me upon a stone?<br>

I write upon your heart; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall discover me within your soul.<br>

You rely too much <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the thinking of others, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too much on the records of the past.<br>

I require of you that you rely on me; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow me to guide you<br>

For I am always here, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my guidance is ever sure, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my inspiration is forever true.<br>

Be not so concerned with the words of books <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as with the inspiration of my spirit.<br>

I speak to you even now, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet you search the record for my words.<br>

Am I a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I should live once and die?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I should speak once and fall silent? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I should reveal myself once and hide?<br>

I have spoken of old. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall speak in all the future.<br>

Listen to me.<br>
Follow me.<br>

I am changeless; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my will shall stand forever.<br>
But the needs of my people change, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so therefore do the words they hear.<br>

For my spirit teaches each <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to his need.<br>

My spirit does not change, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is a perfect teacher.<br>

To each generation <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirit comes anew—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leading my people into righteousness, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guiding them into truth.<br>
