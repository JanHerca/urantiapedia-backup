It is not possible that the Spirit could have more of goodness than the Father since all goodness takes origin in the Father, but in the acts of the Spirit we can the better comprehend such goodness.

> “Why do you call me good? None is good but God.” ([UB 196:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_2) )

The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the “will of the Father in heaven.” Jesus’ God was at one and the same time “The Holy One of Israel” and “The living and loving Father in heaven.”

Goodness, like truth, is always relative and evil contrasted.

In its true essence, religion is a faith-trust in the goodness of God. God could be great and absolute, somehow even intelligent and personal, in philosophy, but in religion God must also be moral; he must be good. Man might fear a great God, but he trusts and loves only a good God. This goodness of God is a part of the personality of God, and its full revelation appears only in the personal religious experience of the believing sons of God.

God cannot create square circles or produce evil that is inherently good. God cannot do the ungodlike thing.

All good things come down from the Father of light, in whom there is no variableness neither shadow of changing.
