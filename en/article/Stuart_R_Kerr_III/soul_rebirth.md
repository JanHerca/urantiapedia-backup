The phenomenon of mortal death—that transaction on the borderland of the physical and morontia realms—remains a supernal mystery to humankind. Clearly, the revelators of truth have been restricted by the celestial governing authorities of Urantia from disclosing to us its full exposition in _The Urantia Book:_
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> _There are many interesting details which might be presented, but I withhold them upon the advice of your immediate planetary supervisors_ [[UB 112:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_11)]

The reassembly of a surviving being takes place in the resurrection hall of the first mansion world, which serves as the rendezvous point for the seraphic destiny guardians, the Thought Adjusters, the archangels of the resurrection, and the Life Carriers. The first step in the reassembly of the constituent parts of a onetime material personality begins with the fabrication of a suitable form, a morontia energy pattern, which the seraphim of assignment “provides” as the new life vehicle for the immortal soul and for the indwelling of the returning Adjuster. The attending seraphim provides, with the assistance of the Morontia Power Supervisors, the undifferentiated morontia material wherein the new morontia life can be initiated. It is within this suitable morontia form, as projected by the guardian of destiny, that _…the new survivor can make contact with nonspiritual reality, and within which the morontia variant of the cosmic mind can be encircuited_ <a id="a45_966"></a>[[UB 112:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_17)]. This morontia mind individualizes the morontia form for all mortal survivors, being of the same creature mind-matrix and passive potentials of identity that were entrusted to the keeping of the seraphic destiny guardians.

> _The physical body of mortal flesh is not a part of the reassembly of the sleeping survivor; the physical body has returned to dust. The seraphim of assignment sponsors the new body, the morontia form, as the new life vehicle for the immortal soul and for the indwelling of the returned Adjuster. The Adjuster is the custodian of the spirit transcript of the mind of the sleeping survivor. The assigned seraphim is the keeper of the surviving identity—the immortal soul—as far as it has evolved._ [[UB 30:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_15)]

The situation which makes repersonalization possible is brought about in the resurrection halls of the morontia receiving planets of a local universe. Here in these life-assembly chambers the supervising authorities provide that relationship of universe energy—morontial, mindal, and spiritual—which makes possible the reconsciousizing of the sleeping survivor. The reassembly of the constituent parts of a onetime material personality involves:

> _1\. The fabrication of a suitable form, a morontia energy pattern, in which the new survivor can make contact with nonspiritual reality, and within which the morontia variant of the cosmic mind can be encircuited._ <a id="a51_218"></a>[[UB 112:5.16-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_16)]

When you thus awaken, when you are thus reconsciousized, you will then see for the first time your long-loved and ever-present angelic companions from your days on Urantia. You will also become keenly aware of the identity and presence of your divine Father fragment who so long indwelt the mind of your mortal existence. This is a true rebirth in all respects, a true spiritual transformation of such magnitude that it is only by the close and loving presence of your destiny guardians and your Thought Adjuster that you will be able to effectively connect your new morontia consciousness with the reviving memory of your previous identity.

As the creative source of local universe intellect, the Mother Spirit ministers a translated modification of cosmic mind to directly assist in the evolution of morontia (soul) mind. Whereas adjutant mind can freely operate within a pattern of material-energy, the superadjutant morontia soul requires the presence of the Adjuster to fully attain self-consciousness. The human mind and the indwelling Adjuster are each aware of the differential presence of the evolving soul, and the soul becomes conscious of the mortal mind and the indwelling Adjuster.

The soul is the joint creation of mortal mind and indwelling Adjuster. The soul is the child of the God-seeking mortal mind and the indwelling presence of the God-revealing and immortal Thought Adjuster. Its spiritual growth is independent of the intellectual self-consciousness, but it is capable of experiencing the presence of the Thought Adjuster and of recognizing its spirit leadings. Spirit identification is propelled by the strivings of mortal mind and survival is conditioned by the desires of mortal mind. The evolving soul will be an eventual portrait of the sum total of mortal decisions.

Mortal mind initiates the universe career of pre-morontia ascension by working in close coordination with the seven adjutant mind-spirits as these are progressively subjected to the unifying direction of the top spirit, the spirit of wisdom. This highest functioning of adjutant mind-spirits assists the mortal creature in the completion of the seven psychic circles of premorontia attainment <a id="a75_393"></a>[[UB 110:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6)]. This mortal mind becomes increasingly motivated in its ongoing search for the supreme realities of truth, beauty, and goodness, and these discoveries ever harmonize themselves with the mortal’s supernal goal of completing the seven circles. All this associated effort inevitably leads to the embryonic growth of the mortal soul and its eventual endowment with morontia mind. This act anticipates the morontia career of local universe progression.

Self-realization and mind-attainment are the supernal and divine goals that the Universal Father sets before his mortal children. The mortal progression through seven psychic circles of cosmic advancement brings about a growing sense of cosmic consciousness and a greater kinship of the evolutionary soul with the emerging Supreme Being. As the mortal being progresses to the soul level of morontia consciousness, he becomes better able to grasp universe meanings and to realize divine values. These accomplishments provide a greater awareness of true universe citizenship and the ensuing promise of local universe progression.

Mastery of the first psychic circle, the final and most accomplished cosmic level of creature mastery, signals the well-earned attainment of premorontia mind maturity. This achievement effectively terminates the collective ministry of the adjutant mind-spirits as the sole and exclusive influence of mind-activity in the mortal personality. Mortal mind now becomes increasingly sensitive to the superimposition of the endowment of morontia mind upon adjutant mind, and this initiates the prespiritual, or morontia, stage of personal evolution. This new mind begins to enjoy the ministry of a superadjutant endowment of the Creative Spirit, an endowment of mind more harmoniously in alignment with cosmic mind.

Progress in the seven psychic circles of mortal advancement entails experiential expansion in personality status, mind attunement, soul growth, and Adjuster attunement. The harmonious functioning of the entire personality, the expansion of the entire self—material, intellectual, and spiritual—characterizes this growth. As the mortal creature superimposes this endowment of morontia soul intellect upon adjutant mind, the creature eventually becomes solely dependent on morontia mind. He begins to seek attunement with the direct ministry of superuniverse cosmic mind; he begins to strive for higher levels of a spiritual existence that lie just beyond the morontia level.

Creature mind experience:

1. Native planet—adjutant ministry.
2. Local universe—morontia intellect.
3. Superuniverse—the direct ministry of cosmic mind.

The evolution of morontia mind is enacted through contact with a modification of cosmic mind that is directly translated by a Divine Minister throughout the vast expanses of her local universe domain. As the creative source of local universe intellect, the Mother Spirit ministers a translated modification of cosmic mind to directly assist in the evolution of morontia mind. We are told that revelation is a technique of atonement for the absence of morontia mind in mortal man for bridging the morontia gulf between the physical and the spiritual realms.

The mortal mind, encircuited into the adjutant ministry of the local universe Mother Spirit, is fully subject to the acts and choosing of the will of human personality. Although the mortal creature possesses identity only on the material level of existence, mortal personality can act by virtue of its freewill choosing to literally transfer _…its seat of identity from the passing material-intellect system to the higher morontia-soul system which, in association with the Thought Adjuster, is created as a new vehicle for personality manifestation_ <a id="a96_551"></a>[[UB 112:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_4)]. This superadjutant morontia soul requires the spirit presence of the Adjuster to retain self-consciousness.
