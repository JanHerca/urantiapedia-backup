God expresses his creative will on three different “experiential” levels of reality—the finite level of the Supreme, the absonite level of the Ultimate, and the superultimate level of the Absolute. These three levels of universe expression take on different forms and phases of creative Deity expression. The term experiential here designates reality that is subject to evolutional growth, where potential realities must evolve and emerge to become fully actualized, and where perfection is a goal to be achieved. Experiential is used to distinguish these three sub-infinite and non-absolute levels of progressive reality expression from the existential (changeless) and infinite level of eternity—the absolute level of Paradise. Paradise is the eternal center of the universe of universes and the abiding place of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit. The three experiential levels of creation are expressive of different modes of Paradise Deity manifestation, and each sub-Paradise level of creation is personalizing a Deity being of expressed divinity. All three of these derivative Deity personalities are not yet fully existent; they are in process of actualization. They have origins, though they are eternal in destiny.

## The Absolute Level of Paradise

This is primal and original reality and the unqualified unity of infinity. The **_Father-I AM_** perfectly unites “the divergences of all reality with an existential majesty that is absolute.” <a id="a40_193"></a>[[UB 106:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_1)] **_The Isle of Paradise_** and the surrounding creation of **_Havona_** make up **_the central universe_** of perfection.

## The Finite Level of the Supreme

This is the time-space evolved unification of four phases of experiential Deity reality—universe power controlled through mind and spirit-unified in the creative presence of personality. This level will power-mind-spirit-personality actualize the **_Supreme Being_** as evolutionary-experiential self. **_The seven evolving superuniverses_** of the **_grand universe_** revolve around the nuclear core of the central universe.

## The Absonite Level of the Ultimate

This is the transcended time-space eventuation of omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent Deity expression. This level is actualizing in the personal Deity of **_God the Ultimate_**. **_The four outerspace levels_** of universe creation that comprise **_the master universe_** revolve around the grand universe as its nucleus.

## The Superultimate Level of the Absolute

This is the experiential-existential realization of absolute divinity and the unification of absolute meanings on absolute levels of expression. **_God the Absolute_** is the realization-attainment goal at this level of personalizing Deity. As there is an inexhaustible supply of potential from infinity for experientializing into actual reality, the idea that there can be a final containment for creation is inconceivable. For this reason, the superultimate creations of **_the cosmos infinite_** present a boundless creation encompassing a **_universe of universes_** with its three successive universe nuclei—the master universe, the grand universe, and the central universe.

The level of the experiential-existential absolute implies the projection of experientials upon a supermaster universe field of creative expression. This level of Deity expression extends out into a cosmos infinite—it yields no limit of expansion extending beyond the master universe because that would require that the existential potentials of absolute infinity could be fully actualized in absolute experience. To limit the actualization of the Absolutes of potentiality would be to theoretically achieve final expression of Deity in the sub-absolute creations. This means that you could somehow exhaust infinite potential, that you could “draw all of the water from a bottomless well.” However, it is well-nigh incomprehensible as to how there could consummate the absolute actualization of an infinity of potentials.

God the Absolute transcends even the superpersonal values and divinity meanings made manifest by God the Ultimate. God the Absolute is the final expression of experiential Deity. The emergence of God the Absolute would signify the full depletion of personalizable Deity expression and self-realization. It would likely imply the experiential uniting of the existential Deity Absolute with the existential Unqualified Absolute.

## **God the Absolute**

<a id="a64_0"></a>[[UB 0:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_18)]

- The experientializing God of transcended superpersonal values and divinity meanings (now existential in the Deity Absolute).
- The third and final experiential level of unified Deity expression and expansion .
- A level of transcended superpersonal values and divinity meanings.
- The exhaustion of personalizable expression.
- The depletion of capacity for self-realization.
- The transcendence of self-revelation to successive and progressive levels of other-personalization.
- The experiential identification of the Deity Absolute with the Unqualified Absolute.
