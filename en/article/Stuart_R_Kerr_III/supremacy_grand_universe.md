Our Paradise Father sets the stage for our particular creation (the Deity realm of Supremacy) as a finite reality; it is conditioned by time and space, it has a beginning and it has a foreordained destiny. This creation is experiential—events occur in time-conditioned sequences, and they are constrained within limiting spatial boundaries. The Universal Father is not restricted or conditioned by the limitations he has imposed on his time-space creations. He is above time and space; he is not handicapped, or bound, by his creation. His reality, as it exists on his eternal abode of Paradise, is absolute reality—it is eternity existence, it is existential. The finite reality that characterizes his Supreme creation can be envisioned as being projected in space and actualized in time, and this reality is intended to be experiencible. The experiential events of time flow ever onward as the moving image of eternity within a finite space that represents the fleeting shadows of Paradise realities.

Finite reality is undergoing purposed mobilization and perfecting unification, and the energy that drives the reality of this finite cosmos originates within the eternal purposes of the Universal Father.

The grand universe is at present the only organized and inhabited creation of the three projected experiential levels of Deity expression. The seven evolving superuniverses of the grand universe are the creations of time, and they are destined to achieve the settled stages of light and life. This status of experiential completion will be achieved as a result of time-space conditioned evolutionary growth. There will be total cosmic integration of mind-mediated spirit control over the material phases of the grand universe. This eventual synthesis of spirit and matter through mind is driven by all participating personalities, both creature and divine, within the inhabited creations. This sovereign effort will unify all seven of the evolving superuniverses of time and space culminating in the realized Deity of the Supreme Being.

The grand universe creation of the seven superuniverses will become a perfected reflection of the perfect Havona pattern. The spirit influence of God the Supreme, previously only to be found from Havona, will now affect the dominance of Supreme perfection throughout all the superuniverses in the grand universe. Because God the Supreme is experiential in nature, we will all be able to share in our own experience of God the Supreme. The emergence of the Supreme Being will be a unified embodiment of evolved deity on the grand universe scale.

### God the Supreme

- _The actualizing or evolving God of time and space_ <a id="a59_54"></a>[[UB 0:2.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_16)]
- The first experiential level of unifying Deity manifestation
- Personal Deity associatively realizing the time-space experiential achievement of creature-Creator identity
- The achievement of Deity unity as the evolving and experiential God of the evolutionary creatures of time and space

In the current grand universe age of the evolving Supreme Being, the seven superuniverses of time and space are kept in isolation from one another in order to maximize their diverse potentials for growth. Each superuniverse reflects a different portraiture of various combinations of the three personal Deities of the Paradise Trinity as these are influenced under the immediate supervision of one of Seven Master Spirits. Upon the settling of all seven superuniverses in the attained stages of light and life, the imposed boundaries dividing these seven superuniverses will be lifted and there will follow an unprecedented surge of supreme coordination on all levels of spirit, mind, and matter. The evolving and experiential Supreme Being will at the same time experience an accelerated factualization of personality-sovereignty.
