_By Claire Mylanus, Associate Trustee, Brittany, France_

Editors Note: Claire Mylanus wrote this article to introduce her husband as an Associate Trustee and the European Manager of Sales. Georges Michelson-Dupont will work with Henk to increase the channels of distribution and sales in Europe.

Henk Mylanus was born in the Netherlands and discovered _The Urantia Book_ in 1972. In 1981 he started attending a study group hosted by Henry and Bauke Begemann of Wassenaar, the Netherlands. In the 1990s he moved to Malta, introduced _The Urantia Book_ to numerous individuals, hosted a study group for twelve years, and continued to attend the Begemann's study group when he was in the Netherlands. He is still hosting study groups in France where he now lives.

Henk studied at Delft Technical University in Holland. After graduating from Delft, he worked in the petrochemical industry in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. He was a Sloan Fellow in the 1971-1972 Executive Program of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business where he obtained his Masters in Business.

In 1981 he became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Dutch Subsidiary of a large German petrochemical company. Henk speaks four languages: Dutch, English, German, and French.

In the short term, Henk's work for Urantia Foundation will focus on solving existing problems with sales and distribution in certain countries of the European Union (EU). In the long term he hopes to streamline the sales and the distribution for translations and for the English edition in 27 countries of the EU.
