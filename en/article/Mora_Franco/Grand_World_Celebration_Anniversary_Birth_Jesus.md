Translation by _Jack Holloway_

On August 21, 2022, it's possible that all of Nebadon was celebrating, and from Urantia we honored and celebrated the 2028th anniversary of the birth of our beloved Jesus!

The reunion was extremely emotional, moving and very creative, with the live and streaming participation via Zoom of 280 attendees from all over the planet. "La luz de Ia revelación" (The light of revelation) was broadcast live on Radio IJrantia where 474 listeners enjoyed the meeting; it was also broadcast live on Urantia TV with 161 viewers. Thus a total of 915 people came together, united in purpose for this global event, which was broadcast with simultaneous translations in four languages: Spanish, English, French, and Portuguese.

Without a doubt it was an excellent gift for our father, teacher, brother, and unconditional friend, Jesus of Nazareth. It was put together with the cooperation of numerous volunteer collaborators, who have given of themselves the best talent and creativity possible. This included music, painting, art, drawings, and audiovisual editing. It also took much time to learn the technical tools and skills necessary for this type of transmission. Along with this went hours and hours of pre-production, so that everything would go beautifully and harmoniously, working as one fraternal team. 

The overall production of this event was under the direction of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, who received the support and co-participation of both Urantia Foundation and Urantia Association International. Executive members of the three institutions were present at the event, and made brief speeches at the time of the affectionate anniversary toast, an opportunity for great joy, sensitivity, and affectivity.

It is worthy and remarkable to make a special note that the youngest collaborator was just fourteen years old, and is an excellent cartoonist. We have been pleasantly surprised by her work. We were fortunate to have many young readers and students of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ actively participating, and we delighted in their creations, just as we were enchanted with the songs of several internationally renowned Urantian musicians.

Another remarkable situation was the attendance of people unfamiliar with _The Urantia Book_, many of whom had just learned of its existence and of the expansion of truth it contains. This great global event, with an anticipated outreach to society at large, greatly contributed to the dissemination of the teachings of the life of Jesus, allowing spiritually sincere seekers to come to know of the existence of our beloved Urantia Book. Some of us imagined that in the corridors of Nebadon, there were stories shared that recognized the volunteer collaborators of this celebration. During the ten days prior to it, we imagined our invisible friends every day in a Zoom meeting with us! With a record day of nine hours, we continue to prepare this wonderful gift for Jesus, Michael of Nebadon! Great job! Congratulations to all.
