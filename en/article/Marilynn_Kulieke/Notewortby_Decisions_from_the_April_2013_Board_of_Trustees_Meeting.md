## Urantia Books

The board reviewed the recently printed dust covers for the Spanish, Russian, and Portuguese hardcover translations of _The Urantia Book_. The English paperbacks with new covers arrived a few days after the meeting. This production run of 16,000 books came just in time for an unveiling at the annual Book Expo America. New covers bring renewed interest and opportunities for _The Urantia Book_. Without an occasional new cover the book industry would view _The Urantia Book_ as an old and tired book. New covers keep the book relevant in the book industry and desirable to bookstore shoppers.

Book sales in the United States were up four percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter in 2012.

The historical index to _The Urantia Book_ is almost complete. Publication plans are underway.

The Russian translation of _The Urantia Book_ has just been reprinted, and Urantia Foundation now begins the process of reintroducing the book into Russia. Even though 17,000 books have been distributed there since 1997, distribution remains a daunting task. Despite our best efforts, the Foundation has never collected a penny for any of these books. We hope this will improve with this new print run.

## Donations Made Easier

Urantia Foundation recently launched a new page at www.urantia.org that answers many of your questions about making wills, passing on property, and donating to your favorite Urantia Book projects. Please visit urantia.plannedgiving.org to find creative ways to support Urantia Foundation while benefiting you and your loved ones at the same time. (See page 1 for highlights.)

## Editorial Policy

The board passed an editorial policy for Urantia Foundation publications, a policy that helps insure quality in all of the Foundation's publications.

## Standard Reference Text Committee

With the copyright of _The Urantia Book_ no longer valid, protecting the original text has become problematic. To solve the problem Urantia Foundation and the Urantia Book Fellowship established a Standard Reference Text Committee to look at all the changes to _The Urantia Book_ since its first 1955 publication. After years of work, the committee recommended the “definitive text,” free of typographical errors. This text has been subsequently referred to as the “Standard Reference Text.” When you see the words “Standard Reference Text” on a Urantia Book, you can trust that the text inside is the bonafide and unadulterated Urantia Book.

With an ongoing need for studying the text, for formatting it, and for implementing the referencing system now used in digital books, we are asking that the joint Foundation and Fellowship sponsored committee be reconstituted under the leadership of Marilynn Kulieke.

## Translations and Revisions

The manager of translations, Trustee Georges MichelsonDupont, presented reports on the Hebrew, Chinese, Indonesian, Farsi, Czech, and Japanese translations, which are currently works-inprogress. A report was also given on the revisions-inprogress: the Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, French, Russian, Romanian, and Polish translations. Urantia Foundation continues, with a steadfast determination, to produce and distribute quality translations that stay true to the original English text. The current translations that need donor support are the Chinese, Indonesian, and Hebrew translations.

The number of Urantia Foundation's translations is increasing, and there is need for professional procedures to produce, revise, manage, and safeguard them. In 20132014 the Foundation will be establishing such procedures.

## Education

2013 Seminars at Urantia Foundation:

- The Cosmic Power of Spiritual Truth, Jeff Wattles, May 2013. (See page 4 for highlights.)
- Scientific Facts That Point to God, Ralph Zehr, November 2013.

If you are interested in participating in the November seminar, please write to urantia@urantia.org for more information.

_By the end of 2013, the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) will move to a new educational software platform that will make conducting and taking classes more intuitive and easier to use. This will be a significant upgrade to the UBIS educational experience. (See page 10 for highlights.)_

## The Third Floor, the Attic, and the Carriage House Renovation Project at 533 W. Diversey Parkway

The historic 105-year-old Chicago home of the Urantia Revelation has undergone extensive renovations on the first and second floors. This year the third floor, the attic, and possibly the carriage house will be renovated. The old water pipes and antiquated electrical wiring could cause significant damage to the newly restored first and second floors. $125,000 has already been raised for the renovation, and another $50,000 is needed for the third floor and $125,000 for the carriage house, which today we would call a garage with an apartment over it. The carriage house, due to sinking, now leans about eight to ten inches back to front. The board requested a future use and financial recommendation for the third floor and the carriage house.
