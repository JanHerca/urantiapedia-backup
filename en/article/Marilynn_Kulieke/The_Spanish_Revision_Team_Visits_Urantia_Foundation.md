_By Marilynn Kulieke, vice president, Urantia Foundation, Illinois, United States_

After years of planning, the Expanded Board of Trustees and staff had the privilege of welcoming the members of the Spanish Revision team to Urantia Foundation headquarters on Thursday, October 19, 2017. The team is comprised of Víctor García-Bory, associate trustee and project coordinator Olga López from Spain, Carmelo Martínez from Spain, Anibal Pacheco from Chile, and Raúl Pujol from Puerto Rico and Florida. The meeting was an unqualified success as participants left with a greater understanding of each other and our shared mission to spread the Urantia Revelation throughout the Spanishspeaking world.

On Thursday night, our first time meeting together with the revision team, we shared a special dinner, introduced team members, heard stories about travel adventures (we almost lost Carmelo in travel mishaps!), and a brief presentation about Urantia Foundation's translation program. After our dinner of Italian food, the team personally greeted each other for only the second time since 2011 when the team began its work.

Our formal meeting with the revision team began on Friday morning. After what we hoped was a good night's sleep for team members who arrived from three different time zones, the team gave a presentation about the hows and whys of the Spanish revision. But more than facts about the revision, we learned about the unity of the team, their love and respect for each other, and their sincere desire to create a more readable, fluent, and accurate Spanish translation. The team met together during the afternoon, discussing topics related to the revised translation. The day ended with a dinner of Mediterranean specialties to celebrate Trustee Henk Mylanus's retirement.

On Saturday morning we again had the opportunity to meet with the revision team. This time the team gave an informative presentation. Víctor García-Bory led the team in a coordinated presentation which included each team member. The theme of the morning was planning for the future launch of the revised Spanish translation. We had impassioned discussions about the crucial need to successfully launch a highquality Spanish translation throughout the world.

The team members continued their work together on Saturday afternoon. But what would a trip to Chicago be without some sightseeing? On this beautiful autumn day in October, the revision team traveled up and down the Chicago River on one of Chicago's most popular attractions, the Chicago Architecture Foundation's boat tour. After a delicious dinner at a Chinese restaurant with expanded board members, our guests ended their evening at a jazz club. With hugs and tears we said our goodbyes with hopes that we would meet again with this extraordinary group of individuals.

Although we may not have treated our guests to an American culinary experience, the unselfish service that was so evident is reflected in Jesus' advice in his farewell discourse to the disciples:

> “That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another.” <a id="a54_142"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1) 

> “If you would share the Master's joy, you must share his love. And to share his love means that you have shared his service.” <a id="a56_128"></a>[UB 180:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_5)
