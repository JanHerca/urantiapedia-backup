_By Marilynn Kulieke, Chair of Translations, vice president, Urantia Foundation, Illinois, United States_

_Editor's Note: During the Cultural Symposium held at Urantia Foundation in April, Marilynn gave an excellent and informative presentation on the process used to produce quality translations. It was video recorded, so please view it here. The end result is a deeper appreciation for the incredible work required to translate_ The Urantia Book.

A main avenue in fulfilling Urantia Foundation's principal object is the production of translations of _The Urantia Book_ into the many languages of our world. They are a vital part of our work in fulfilling the mission of seeding _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings globally.

It is my pleasure to serve as chair of the Translation Committee. Other members are Georges MichelsonDupont (manager of translations), Henk Mylanus, Jay Peregrine, Minoo, and Tamara Strumfeld. Our work, including the creation of this process, is truly a team effort.

It is our goal to be the producer of the highest-quality translations, and therefore our translation committee created a systematic process based on our love for the Urantia Revelation. The process development began in 2006, and is based on the Standard Guide for Quality Assurance in Translation that was adopted by ASTM International.

As we applied these standards, it became clear to us that a fivestage process of approximately 40 years or more was needed to produce a high-quality translation. These stages are outlined as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    P1["
        Stage One: Preparation
        1-10 years\n
        &bull; One or more individuals 
        have been inspired by The Urantia 
        Book's teachings.
        &bull; The motivation required to 
        translate the book is finally alive.
    "]
    P2["
        Stage Two: Appraising
        6 months- 1 year\n
        &bull; Is the chief translator 
        qualified? 
        &bull; Are there resources available?
        &bull; Is it possible for the translation 
        to be readable, faithful, and
        uniform in terminology?
    "]
    P3["
        Stage Three: Translating
        9-10 years\n
        &bull; The work begins!
        &bull; Translator must deeply
        understand English text.
        &bull; New words and syntax must be 
        developed.
        &bull; Must be beautiful.
    "]
    P4["
        Stage Four: Maturing
        5-15 years\n
        &bull; Translation is published and
        distributed.
        &bull; Interest develops among
        individuals and groups.
        &bull; Feedback is given.
        &bull; Ideas for revision are
        formulated.
    "]
    P5["
        Stage Five: Revising
        5-6 years\n
        &bull; A team is developed.
        &bull; Terms are clarified.
        &bull; Quality is improved.
        &bull; Text is polished. 
    "]
    P1 ==> P2
    P2 ==> P3
    P3 ==> P4
    P4 ==> P5
```

At the end of this process, when the revision has matured, it is time to reintegrate the enhanced language and clarity of thinking into the evolutionary channels and cultures just waiting for this new truth. The following quote truly sums up the work we are engaged in:

> The spread of civilization must wait upon language. Live and growing languages insure the expansion of civilized thinking and planning. During the early ages important advances were made in language. Today, there is great need for further linguistic development to facilitate the expression of evolving thought. <a id="a115_314"></a>[UB 81:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_16)
