As Chair of the Judicial Committee it has been my privilege to enjoin David Schlundt, Beth Wenger, Geri Johnson, Merritt Horn and Elizabeth Callahan as committee members, and Albert Lassiter as adjunct. Among other responsibilities we are active in the education and interpretation of the Constitution of THE URANTIA BOOK FELLOWSHIP. We will always employ Mercy and forbearance as our first response to any controversy requiring Justice that may arise among Fellowship committees or members. I'm proud to say that these types of interventions are few and far between. We seek to be conversant in Robert's Rules of Order to facilitate our meetings. We will be prepared in the future to facilitate and evaluate beneficial changes in our Constitutional structure should the desideratum of the Fellowship dictate such revisions. We are always on call for advice and counsel for anyone at any time.
