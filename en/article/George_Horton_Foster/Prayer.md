It seems to this writer that it is variously stated and implied in _The URANTIA Book_ that what one needs and wants is already known to the Father, even although one's own perception may be nebulous, incomplete, or otherwise misunderstood. So the object of prayer need never be a supplication of one's desires. But prayer may be of great value for clarification of those desires for oneself. As in psychotherapy, verbalization, whether spoken or written, will help bring about recognition and understanding of one's hopes, fears, needs, and intentions. Further, regular verbalization of prayer if you prefer, will not only allow modification of the statements when new knowledge or experience suggests change is appropriate, but also will help maintain action, and consistency of action, based upon those statements. It seems to this writer that the link between prayer and action is of great importance, but appears to be badly neglected in many cases.

In any event, the following is offered as an example which this writer has found useful as a reminder of intent, which is repeated at the beginning of each day, and sometimes later as well:

To help understand and maintain my resolve, I wish to affirm: It is my will that the Father's will be done. This means to me that I assume responsibility for trying to make every decision one which will maximize good and minimize evil in the world. It also means that I will love my fellow human beings, and will demonstrate this to the best of my ability by exhibiting understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and assistance. It is my desire to do these things for intrinsic reasons and for their being my best estimate of what the Father's will might be.

But in addition to this, it is my most profound hope that for eons and eons I will remain consciously self-aware, and will be a contributing participant in the continuing evolution of this marvelous universe. I want to grow, to learn, to create, and to be of service. This is my expression of resolve and of hope.

It is hoped that the reader will find the above meaningful and perhaps helpful in developing a personal statement for similar use.
