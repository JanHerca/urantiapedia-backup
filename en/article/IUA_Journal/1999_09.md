## The UrantiaBook Internet School

The UBIS is off to an excellent beginning. The first five courses on the schedule are fully enrolled and are in progress. The courses have attracted English readers in several countries, and the teacher/ facilitators report enthusiasm and interested participation in the courses.

The courses are eight weeks in duration, and the format follows the Socratic technique: assigned study, questions, and guided discussion of responses.

The UBIS is now looking ahead and planning for the second semester, the Winter/Spring scheduling of courses. We are looking for long-time readers who would like to serve as teacher/facilitators. If you have teaching experience (either formal or informal), internet skills, available time, and perhaps a favorite topic, please consider teaching a class this spring.

This is a new and exciting service project, and we hope that many of you will bring your talents and time, and join us in this effort.

Please contact Dorothy Elder, the UBIS chairperson, at delder03@sprynet.com for more information. We need to hear from those who are interested soon, as the planning for the next semester will begin October 1.

## Millenium Initiative Committee Statement

The Gulley, Vermont, USA
June 13, 1999

The Millennium Initiative Committee, in unanimity, believes that true unity of purpose, as manifest in a unified, worldwide reader community, is in the best interests of the fifth epochal revelation as we enter the next millennium.

To that end, and with utmost respect for the self-acting integrity of the existing organizations in the community, we unanimously recommend a formal working alliance between the International Urantia Association and _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship.

While the common experience and deepened friendships which were a significant part of our work together will forever bind the participants, we agreed to dissolve the Millennium Initiative Committee and encourage the existing organizations to continue this process.

In friendship,

## A visit to Russia

Cathy Jones, IUA Administrator

My invitation to visit St. Petersburg came from Vitaly Kondratjev, a retired physician, who is in process of becoming the Urantia Foundation Representative in Russia. Working through much bureaucratic red tape, he has become a book distributor, making it possible to distribute _The Urantia Book_ in Russia. In 1997 Georges Dupont and Tom Burns presented the Russian translation to the people of Russia, but were able to bring only a limited number of copies. Through Vitaly's relentless efforts, on July 29, 1999, 900 copies of the Russian translation of _The Urantia Book_ were received at Vitaly's office!

I was met at the airport on August 25 by Vitaly, accompanied by Andrey Resnikov, who had agreed to be my translator while in St. Petersburg. Andrey, a Russian native, is a university professor of English and a brother of Michael, who now lives in Finland. These two brothers, who have both read the book in English over five times, were the primary translators of the book that is now in the hands of their fellow countrymen.

## Reflections on IC 99 at Vancouver 

Excerpts from reports by Sioux Harvey, Cathy Jones, and James Woodward

The IC 99 conference was an amazing experience. This international conference (IC) happens once every three years and has a festive atmosphere. In between the ICs, the Fellowship has a summer study session that is focused around study of a particular topic of the book. These study sessions are usually less well attended. Our IUA conferences are much more study or task focused. The three styles fit nicely with one another because each has a different focus.

### Fellowship Conclave

On August 7, the day before the conference, some 20 members of International Urantia Associations participated in the Fellowship Conclave which was initiated by the First Society of Chicago. This was a significant event, as no such meeting had occurred since the 1980 s, and the invitation to attend was warmly received by the IUA.

The event was co-facilitated by Barbara Newsom of the Fellowship and Cathy Jones of the IUA. The focus of the meeting was to find ways of working together in our individual communities. To that end, it was a resounding success. Many reports were given, demonstrating joint events and projects.

We went to the meeting in a spirit of love and brotherhood, and the meeting ended in just that manner. There was no attempt to solve any organizational differences. The IUA made it very clear that they are completely sure what their principles and objectives are and that they will continue to pursue worthy projects, centered on disseminating the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, as delegated under Article 3.4 of the Declaration of Trust.

The conclave really started a process, rather than being an end in itself. The most frequently heard comment was that attendees were “encouraged” by the meeting. Many spoke of further healing and of being re-motivated. There was a feeling of openness and goodwill that pervaded the meeting as well as the entire five days of the conference.

### The Five Days of Conference

To be with several hundred readers in any environment is special. The Vancouver conference gathered over 905 readers, including 79 children, 40 teenagers, and 786 adults.

Our quest of sharing in our Father's love and reaching to be spirit-led was the center of the conference. Every morning we sat and worshiped together in the magnificent Chan Center.

The program was diverse, as one would expect — including the Teaching Mission, UFOs, and historical studies on the book, as well as sessions on parables and meditation, prayer circles, and enough worship and spiritual growth-centered offerings to keep a seeker happy. Truly a tremendous variety of educational and enriching workshops was available — it was difficult to sort through the choices and decide which to attend.

The plenary speakers included Gard Jameson, Paul Snider, David Kantor, Janet Graham, and Paula Thompson. Entertainment included the Urantia choir, the Vancouver choir, Pato Banton, Buffy St. Marie, the Striders, Francyl Gawryn, and the Urantia kids (4 to 17 years old) who sang “One World Is Enough” the last morning with Pato Banton. There was also plenty of exposure for homemade music and impromptu jams, including a duet of “You Are My Miracle,” featuring Richard Keeler and Kathleen Swadling. Bob Salone played an inspirational piece on the piano at one of the morning worhip services. We were all delighted, uplifted, and thankful that we have such a depth of talent among our ranks.

It was really nice to have so many children and young adults running around the place, enjoying their vacation, participating in activities, but largely ignoring the grown-ups. The programs and activities geared to the kids were great, and it seemed as if they were having their own mini-conference. Hats off to Sara Blackstock and all her helpers.

The Trustees' talk on Monday was very well received, with many from the audience commenting that they liked what they heard. Richard Keeler's talk was especially moving, leaving a great feeling of hope among the listeners.

At the General Council meeting on Friday, the Fellowship passed a resolution to support the Millennium Initiative alliance with the IUA.

One of our greatest challenges is to continue to build the interpersonal relationships between our two member organizations. Nothing gives us the potential to solve our differences like getting to know each other as people, which is where love can grow. We have had upheavals and conflicts that have led to mutual distrust. We are healing, and we now seem to want to do better as a unit.

It's a wonderful family of believers that we all are. The strength of both organizations lies in the depth of the dedicated, talented, and evolving personalities that belong to each group. Membership is a small part of who we are — though, granted it has contributed to no small amount of grief in the last decade. But minds and hearts are changing across the board even though controversy grabs the headlines. It's much like that analogy-people are mostly just trying to work through their lives as best they can. And so are all their neighbors, but when the newspaper shouts that an unsavory crime has been committed, people question their sense of community and civility.

The sensationalism of the past doesn't seem to resonate well with most of our readers these days, and we pray that the leadership is closing in on forgiveness and dedication to future work in a collective spirit. There really is no other choice.

## Part IV Illegally Printed

**July 22, 1999**

We are sad to acknowledge that one of our brothers and fellow readers, Harry McMullan III, has chosen to print 15,000 copies of Part IV of _The Urantia Book_ as a separate book.

We see Mr. McMullan's publishing Part IV separate from Parts I, II, and III as counterproductive for the following reasons:

1. It is illegal.
2. It does not preserve the text — the entire text — inviolate.
3. The authors of the book have given us a carefully painted picture of the cosmos, its origin, history, and destiny in relation to the life and teachings of Jesus, our Creator Son, as he is carefully portrayed in Parts I, II, III, and IV of the book.
4. It encourages other people to break up the book, to break the law, and to violate the copyright.
5. It presents the Urantia teachings as a Christian cult — especially with the crucified Christ on the cover — rather than as the fifth epochal revelation to the entire world. The Foundation has worked diligently to avoid presenting _The Urantia Book_ as another “white man's religion” — witness the Korean and Arabic translations and the Trustees' recent trip to Muslim Senegal.
6. It is an affront to the unity initiatives.

Urantia Foundation is considering its legal position and response at this time. It asks you to discourage people from buying this illegal, unauthorized, and partial presentation of the fifth epochal revelation.

## The Future of Our Planet As a “Known” and “Unknown” Reality — Part II & III

Peep Sõber, Talilinn, Estonia
_The Urantia Book_ Readers' Conference in Estonia, at Karepa, 12 August 1998

**Part II. The future of our planet: scientific and prophetic predictions**

Modern man tends to put his confidence in science; let us, therefore, have a look at some scientific assertions.

A recent United Nations study shows that the population of the world will be 7.4 billion in the year 2050 and 10.8 billion in 2150 . This is actually a very optimistic view, based on the assumption that every woman would give birth to only two children. The vision becomes quite something else if the average birth rate will continue to be what it was in the period of 1990 - 1995. In that latter scenario, this planet will be populated by 269 billion inhabitants in 2150 about 20 times more than in the U.N. study! Can you visualise the U.S.A. with a population of 12 billion or our small Estonia with 75 million? Another aspect: in 2150, the developed countries will accommodate only 10 percent, instead of the current 19 percent, of the world's population. It doesn't require much to predict that the world will be witnessing an earth-shaking crisis sometime between 2030 and 2050; our planet simply cannot sustain a population as massive as that. Our energy and other natural resources will become depleted. The ecological crisis of today will appear more like a child's game compared with these more serious problems.

## Contradictions or Creative Tensions in The URANTIA Book? 

JefFrey Wattles, StafF Writer

Was Jesus ever in a hurry? Page <a id="a166_32"></a>[UB 100:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_14) says “never”; page <a id="a166_97"></a>[UB 136:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p0_1) says “only a few times.” Can we discern truth, beauty, and goodness in the phenometia of the material world? Yes (<a id="a166_255"></a>[UB 195:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_4)) and no (<a id="a166_308"></a>[UB 103:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_13)). Have you ever noticed what seemed to be a contradiction in _The Urantia Book_? How did you react? Do the authors themselves offer any guidance to help make sense of such an experience? Sometimes we need only draw a simple distinction to resolve the problem; sometimes the question surpasses the capacity of the human mind; sometimes there is a challenge calling for emotional maturity and soul growth.

Some tensions seem comparatively trivial. Is our first duty to strive for perfection (<a id="a168_86"></a>[UB 1:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_4)) or to worship God (<a id="a168_146"></a>[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1))? I don't believe there is any reason to resolve that difference. Even the issue of whether the Book of Job presents an excellent (<a id="a168_319"></a>[UB 96:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_5)) or poor (<a id="a168_371"></a>[UB 148:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p6_11)) concept of God seems to be a matter of what features the commentator chose to emphasize. Other tensions are hard. Trying to synthesize perspectives and hints in the papers regarding the management of epochal revelation is as difficult a task of interpretation as I know.

## The Mind Arena of Choice

Chris Moseley, Oxfordshire, Great Britain

The concept of Mind in itself, in the abstract, unlimited sense of the word, does not imply free will, but the individual mind, mortal mind, has freewill as an inseparable, defining component. In the passage on p. 1216 entitled “The Mind Arena of Choice,” there is a striking sentence that almost expresses the kernel of the whole human condition: _Human consciousness rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above_ <a id="a176_487"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5). Viewed in these terms, what a finelytuned creature a human being seems; what a mysterious fragility everyday existence has; and what grave responsibilities are implied for all the choices we make!

Whether undifferentiated, in the sense of infinite or absolute mind, or finite, acting through the ministry of the adjutant mind spirits, all mind can be **superimposed energy** (<a id="a178_179"></a>[UB 9:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p4_2))—in other words, mind can directionize energies through its own choices. Mind adds meaning to energy.

## China—Reasons to be Cheerful

Mark Philip Bloomfield, United Kingdom

Come on everyone, let's get this Chinese translation finished so that we can offer the Master's teachings to our brethren, the yellow race. Let's contribute whatever we can spare to Urantia Foundation's translation fund to finance this crucially important translation for the benefit of much of China's 1-2 billion people.

These are the days we are given. Great days for us to “be about the Father's business,” great days to attempt to extend the Kingdom of Heaven. And it seems we are the fortunate few blessed with this unique opportunity of rendering this supernal service to our fellows in the East.

## _The Urantia Book_ in the Muslim World

EXCERPTS FROM A REPORT BY

Georges Michelson-Dupont, France

Many of us have wondered if and how _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings could be accepted by the vast and growing Muslim world. This story is at least a partial answer to those questions.

**How the Story Began**

Moussa N'Diaye is a 68 -year old professor of Social Psychology at Dakar University. He is also a truth-seeker and all his life has been devoted to find the truth about God. Having grown up as a Muslim, he exceeded his beliefs and entered into a spiritual journey that led him to find _Le Livre d'URANTIA_ in 1973. After a careful reading he started to study its teachings. Soon he was convinced of its revelatory nature and decided to share the new truth with his fellow countrymen.

**His teaching technique**

Knowing the nature of the religious thinking and the cultural background of the Senegalese (basically Muslim), he thought it was not appropriate to introduce the book itself without a careful intellectual and spiritual preparation. Therefore, he studied how Jesus taught his apostles and his group of believers. The presentation of new truth needs a soft, non-invasive, and loving approach that will not hurt the individual beliefs. He also selected in the Koran some basic principles and concepts that were close to _The Urantia Book_ teachings and on which he could start the introduction of expanded ideas.

## Seeing Scientists As Partners

Neal Waldrop, Geneva, Switzerland

The Midwayers assure us, the worst of the materialistic age is over, then state, _The higher minds of the scientific world are no longer wholly materialistic in their philosophy. Nevertheless, they concede that the rank and file of the people still lean in that direction as a result of former teachings_ <a id="a214_305"></a>[UB 195:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4).

Evangelizing the rank and file of the people is not the challenge we face, even though their underlying psychology appears to have changed little over the last half century. It would be quixotic and counterproductive to hawk the Midwayer Commission's eloquent refutation of materialistic fallacies (<a id="a216_299"></a>[UB 195:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_10)-<a id="a216_345"></a>[UB 195:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_16)), or the equally persuasive comments by a Melchizedek of Nebadon (<a id="a216_457"></a>[UB 103:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_11)-<a id="a216_503"></a>[UB 103:9.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_10)). I am strongly convinced that readers of the fifth epochal revelation must operate by attractionnot by attempting to proselytize or promote “conversions.”
