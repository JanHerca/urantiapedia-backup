## An Evening with Madiba: A report from the Parliament of the World's Religions

Gard Jameson

I would like to share a few reflections on a recent trip to Capetown, South Africa, to the Parliament of the World's Religions to provide you with a brief flavor of a glimpse of light and life. I am providing some of these reflections the day after Nelson Mandela, Madiba, addressed the Parliament, saying, “We commend the Parliament of the World1s Religions for its immense role in saying the common ground is greater and more enduring than those aspects which divide.” The same day a beautiful brother from Senegal, Moussa N11diaye, and a small group of Yankees, including Travis Binion, Marvin Gawryn, and Paula Thompson spoke similar sentiments to an assembled group of interested spiritual seekers at the University of South Africa in presenting _The Urantia Book_. In a land where division has created immense problems, a genuine spirit of dialogue has created the opportunity for immense solutions.

My experience in Capetown, and in other interfaith venues, convinces me that _The Urantia Book_ is to serve as a leaven to the great traditions of the world; and, so it is serving. As we are witnessing firsthand at events such as this, the power of its vision is so much greater as a leaven than as another religion among the family of religions. As a Methodist, I am able to share the great truths of the book so much more effectively by referring to its expression of spiritual value and not to any religious institution. As a Muslim, my brother, Moussa from Senegal, is able to share the great truths of the book so much more effectively. For Moussa, as for myself, _The Urantia Book_ serves to enhance our experience within our chosen religious institution. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Indigenous Traditions, and many others here have been drawn to _The Urantia Book_ by understanding and appreciating that leavening vision. We have sold or given away every book brought to South Africa.

## The Privilege of Having God as “Father”

Jean Barr
Texas, USA

There has been and is misunderstanding and confusion in the use of the word “Father” as God, “Son” of God, and “Brotherhood of Man” in _The Urantia Book_. There should be no confusion in this area, because, despite the conditions in which our current society conceives the concept of gender, the truth of the matter is that at our level of existence, the male-female reality exists and is necessary — but the male-female concept does not exist on God's level of existence. In many passages, _The Urantia Book_ is very clear on this subject; understanding the duality of God's nature is natural for understanding the treasures of our revelation — but this duality extends into the superuniverses and has absolutely nothing to do with the “gender” of God.

God is total unity, and He is presented to us as our Father to help us accept His love, guidance and advice and reality on a personal level. The fact that He uses the technique of separation into seven Absolutes in the space-time continuum of eternity is necessary or we would not exist, but in reality He is ONE. Bringing our God down to the human level and arguing about His “gender” is not allowed — “gender” is for humans only — God has no “gender” — HE IS.

## A Balanced Unified Personality — the Foundation for Religious Growth

Ralph D. Zehr, 
New York, USA 
Presented At Estonia, Karepa, 1999

Webster gives the following definition of religion: “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs” (_Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary_, 1996)

_The Urantia Book_ offers many definitions for religion. Let¹s consider the following three definitions:

1\. _True religion is a wholehearted devotion to some reality which the religionist deems to be of supreme value to himself And the outstanding characteristics of all religions are: unquestioning loyalty and wholehearted devotion to supreme values._ <a id="a85_250"></a>[[UB 100:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p6_1)]

## The Family: Birthplace of Cosmic Citizens

Plenary Address, IC99, August 1999, Canada 
Paul Snider, USA

I salute the God within you.

We bring a child into the world. A simple and ordinary thing, but wonderfully complex. Whether we know it or not, we have now become engaged in the supreme responsibility of human existence. We have now begun the process of nurturing and shaping a cosmic citizen. What faith the Father in heaven has in us to allow us the privilege of doing this. To entrust His children to our watchcare. Of all human trusts, this is the most sacred, our highest human duty. Whether we know it or not, these are the facts of life.

(By the way, you'll notice quite a few Urantia Book references in what I have to say. I'll mention only a few of them specifically.)

What is it about the idea of family that makes it so profoundly important? Why does _The Urantia Book_ say that almost everything of lasting value has its roots in the family, that the home is civilization's only hope of survival? Why is it that the family occupied the very center of Jesus' philosophy of life, here and hereafter? What is it in this simple notion that resonates from here to Paradise and beyond?

## Let the Children Participate . . .

Mike Wood, USA

During the first meetings of our study group, we read some of the “Religion” papers before deciding to begin a sequential reading of Part Four beginning with Paper 119, “The Bestowals of Christ Michael.” Two of my sons, Noah (age 18) and Joel (age 15) both started attending right from the start. About the thrid week, Matthew (age 10) asked if he could come and sit in. I said, “Sure, we'd love to have you.” The next week, he sat in and read with us.

When it came his turn to read, we were ready for “6. The Home at Nazareth” (р.1349). He proceeded to read it fluently and flawlessly, which absolutely astounded everyone present. Several of us were nearly in tears from the intensity of the moment.

The next week was the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and we had a large group because besides the “regulars”, two of my other sons, Seth and Chris, were home from school and both had friends with them. Again Matthew wanted to sit in and read with us. That week we were reading Paper 124, “The Later Childhood of Jesus,” and when it came to Matthew's turn in this large group, he got to read “2. The Tenth Year (A.D. 4).” Matthew is 10, and this didn't go unnoticed. As I marveled at boththe coincidence and his ability to read and “hold his own”in a group like this, I looked around the room and saw five of my children absorbed in reading _The Urantia Book_. For a moment, I was overcome with an emotion that far exceeds the normal definition of gratitude. I am truly blessed beyond any reasonable expectation.

## Urantia Book Youth

Presented At The Anzura Conference, Melbourne, Australia, 1999 

Merindi Swadling, Australia

Hi there everyone. As you are all most likely aware, my name is Merindi Swadling. I would like to share some of my recent experiences with you today. First of all, some background info:

- I am 25 years old
- My parents Kathleen and Trevor — have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for about 20 years
- I have been reading for about 18 months
- and no, I have not yet completed this amazingly huge book, but I am getting there.

I just want to ask a few questions of you all:
- Who here has children?
- How many of these children are under 30 years old?
- And how many of these have read or are reading _The Urantia Book_?
- So, where are they all today?

## News from Scandanavia:

In November, readers from or living in Scandinavia gathered in Gothenburg, Sweden, in a meeting hastily arranged due to the visit of a French reader This we might call the first Scandinavian gathering, but hardly the last. The three main Scandinavian languages are fairly similar, but not similar enough to render the formation of a Scandinavian UAI a practical option. Nevertheless, we did indeed discuss how to better coordinate our efforts to translate _The Urantia Book_. (By the way, Finland is a Nordic country but not a part of Scandinavia, their language being completely incomprehensible to us.) We also witnessed and participated in the first steps to initiate a local study group in Gothenburg, which would be the only one in Scandinavia besides the one in Oslo, Norway.

## Urantia 2000 UAI Conference

New York, USA

August 4-7, 2000

The United States Urantia Association is hosting the International Conference at Wagner College on Staten Island in New York August 3-7. This is a special event! Not only are we celebrating a new century, but also this year is the 50th anniversary of Urantia Foundation. What an opportunity to meet and get to know our brothers and sisters from all parts of the world!

The United States Urantia Association cordially invites the entire Urantia Book readership to celebrate, worship and commune with our Paradise Father as we join in sharing our spiritual lives and personal experiences with the Spirit Fragment of our Father that indwells us all. The theme of this conference is:

The Spiritual Experience

LIVING THE WILL OF OUR FATHER

For three and one-half days this conference will be devoted and dedicated wholly to Our Universal Father and Living His Will. Here, participants will explore and discover many ways, means and methods that may be employed for personally seeking, finding, and actually doing the Father's will in our daily lives. The Adjuster will be the focus of this conference, just as it was with Jesus as he demonstrated his wonderful life in the flesh and as he lived the will of our Father.

With the insight gained from the revelators of _The Urantia Book_, the conference participants may explore the many manners used by the Master, suggested by the Divine Counselor and related by the Solitary Messenger to know God¹s will, choose it, and actually do it as a conscious part of living. Everyone will have ample opportunity to share this knowledge and their personal discoveries with each other, as time will be set aside for walking in threes among the greenery of the campus.

The conference program is designed to provide the participant with the exciting Spiritual Experience of Living the Will of Our Father, a step toward Light and Life and eventual fusion. Again, the emphasis here is on the word LIVING the Father¹s will. Speakers and workshop leaders hail from all over the world. A special children's program is planned.

CONFERENCE FEES«DISCOUNT FOR EARLY REGISTRATION:The cost of the conference including housing, a variety of delicious meals, and conference materials is 325.00$ until April 10, 2000. After this date, the conference cost will be 375.00$. Children will enjoy a reduced price.
