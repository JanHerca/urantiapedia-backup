You may have read my other article in this _Mighty Messenger_, [“The First Urantia Book Conference in Uganda: A personal account.”](/en/article/Aprilhelen/The_First_Urantia_Book_Conference_in_Uganda) Looking through the lens of my multiple experiences serving internationally, most recently in Uganda, serving the International Fellowship Committee (IFC) of The Urantia Book Fellowship (a.k.a. the Fellowship), and being a conference planner for the last three decades, I am offering the ideas below for the potential of adding value to our growing Urantia Book community and the Supreme Being (the aspect of God that we each get to participate in its evolution).

## Suggestions for Serving or Working Internationally

As with all of our siblings on Urantia, we each bring unique gifts to offer; and getting to know individuals, their talents, and their cultures will help us to better serve one another. As we reassess how we fund our international communities, it behooves us to consider the momentum ignited at this first Urantia Book conference in the "Pearl of Africa" (a nickname for Uganda), and in other areas of the World, while continuing to empower our siblings toward deeper understanding and elevated integration of spiritual values revealed by Jesus.

Our sister Geri Johnson, a longtime Urantia Book student, international worker, and global service citizen, has given me permission to publish some of her wise words:

> What you do and how you act reflects on the service organization whose mission you are working to support ... which not only impacts the worker but the entire service organization. The organization and all of its workers may come under scrutiny and suspicion such that they may be hampered in what they can accomplish.

## Have a Colleague From The Host Country

> No matter how much you learn, it is crucial to have, as a partner, a colleague that is native to the country of service. They know how to navigate the terrain, literally and figuratively. 
> 
> You will be an outsider to any local community. People will likely be friendly and kind, but that does not mean they trust you yet. By how your coworker and you work together, people will begin to accept and trust you. 
> 
> A good working partnership is invaluable to the mission. And a friend, a good friend, is a wonderful treasure to have.

Geri's words ring true for me, although in a different way. Some of the organizing members for the conference in Uganda were not living the values held by the supporting donors. The spirit part of spirit-led teamwork was unfortunately lacking. This is why I am writing this article.

The following are some suggestions for future conference planning, starting before the conference itself.

## Assess Local Dedication

Since the Ugandan conference, it has been discussed by both Spiritual Family Network (SFN) and the IFC that it is important, prior to funding international projects, to encourage a lengthy period of entire Urantia Book study. Only then will we be able to recognize the sincere students and potential leaders emerging from these self-dedicated groups. The IFC and SFN have already begun to increase their efforts in online materials and study groups.

## Stakeholder Coordination and Representation

Requiring that a representative, who is in more intimate association with both the donors and the recipients, be an active member of the organizing team will aid clarity of communication and transparency. Members of the sponsor organizations should also be active members of the local organizing team. As some of us have experienced, when working in multilingual groups, much may be Iost in translation; therefore, the highest levels of consciousness in communication is a supreme asset.

## Rethink Spending Priorities

It was curious to me that in the unfortunate local economy of Uganda, the money spent on promotional goods was extreme compared to what I am used to experiencing at many other conferences, in and outside of the Urantia Book community. This overspending could have been reallocated for helping more attendees to participate. The booklet which was produced for conference attendees (printed from the Fellowship's website) for guiding new study group leaders was a decent asset; however, it would have been best if the contacts listed for further advice were seasoned Urantia Book students who live the teachings.

As far as sending money in the future, there seems to be wisdom in the collaboration of co-sponsoring events. We also would be wise to address concerns of poverty by striking the harmony chords of self-sufficiency.

Pato Banton reflects with these words:

In our years of experience with the truth seekers of Africa, we have found that there are many unique challenges for each individual and community to  face. In Uganda the main [dilemmas seem] to be poverty, a lack of education, orphaned children, and the ongoing need to support them. The cry for help can be overwhelming sometimes, and it has become increasingly apparent that, instead of constantly giving out fish, we must find ways to teach those in need how to fish and become more self-sufficient. Apart from poverty and the basic needs of food and housing, there are the issues of being isolated and the lack of connectivity with other readers and the outside world.

## Train Facilitators

As we witness the emergence of devoted students, we can help to train them for the role of teachers and leaders, especially for the formation of study groups and children's programs, while vetting Area Coordinator Field Workers, as liaisons for donor organizations. The question and answer sessions during the Uganda conference could have benefitted from a training which includes the expression of spiritual values. The breakout sessions would have produced more effective discussions if better facilitation techniques were employed, like respect, cooperation, equanimity, inclusion, and accuracy. This, of course, will arrive more naturally as the study and integration of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ are prioritized in spirit-led teamwork and leadership.

Leadership training based on the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ would do very well for those desiring to serve in this way. It is also collective knowledge that nothing replaces immersing oneself into the teachings to progress with spiritual fragrance. As some of you may know, I have been exploring the expression of spiritual values within leader development over the last several years through [Urantia University Institute](https://www.urantiauniversity.org/) and the Progress Project Service Corps. We have identified many major themes of Jesusonian methods, especially principles for navigating interrelational challenges and communicating in the service of progress.

_Efective and wise leadership_. In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective load- pulling spirit. Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together—all at the same moment. And such teamwork—social ccyoperation—is dependent on leadership. The cultural civilizations of the past and the present have been based upon the intelligent co-operation of the citizenry with wise and progressive leaders; and until man evolves to higher levels, civilization will continue to be dependent on wise and vigorous leadership.

One possibility is inspired by “Paper 72. Government on a Neighboring Planet.” ([UB 72](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72)) Instead of sending emissaries to Other lands, invite them to our land, so they may learn by example. Then when they return, along with renewed motivation, they Will better live and share the revelatory teachings with enthusiasm. Spiritual Family Network has once created this opportunity for an African leader, Moses Kaharwa. There could be a program of inviting our international siblings for a season or semester to be immersed in a family or community of Urantia Book practitioners who Will host these foreign Moses Kaharwa exchange students, with the intention to be a leader in their home region. This could easily become an ongoing project of the Urantia Book community, which could benefit many generations progressing toward the era of Light and Life. 

And the following are some suggestions for during the conference itself.

## Invest in Relationship Building

As I watched the conference unfold, I witnessed greater bonds of relationships developed through appreciated personal conversations. After the final breakout which was designed to receive feedback on how to move forward, there were many pictures taken, exchange of contact information, hugs, and laughter. The attendees could have certainly benefited from icebreakers and team building activities on the arrival day to have inspired the camaraderie that was more palpable on the final day. 

Toni Oyeyemi said it perfectly: 

> Since the conference was the first of its kind, a lot more emphasis could have been placed on activities which would foster friendship and fellowship between the diverse attendees, to balance the in- depth studies that were done. In my experience, team-building exercises and activities are of great benefit to Toni Oyeyemi first-time groups to aid in bonding and receptivity of new concepts. 

## Offer Audience-Appropriate Variety 

The audience would do well to be divided into groups based on their understanding of the revelation. Offering as many programs during a particular time slot as necessary to meet the audience where they are is an effective way to help the most people leave with greater satisfaction.

## Build in More Time to Share and Reflect

Presentations that seem to gain the most attention from the audience are those which are structured with a brief set up of topic, breakouts with specific questions to answer as a group, and returning to the large group for clarification and expansion of the topic.

Most conference goers who I have befriended over the years agree that reducing the structured program to allow for reversion and socialization is very beneficial to the spirit of fellowship. And, of course, there is no substitute for extended periods of group worship when fellowship is emphasized!

## Call to Action

Are you interested in service on a global scale? Our international community is expanding! Apart from these suggestions above, I am Still very curious as to what the future of _The Urantia Book_ culture and movement looks like.

The eye-opening experience in Uganda has raised big questions for me in regard to international spirit-led teamwork, which are fodder for a future article:
- What are the main tenets of spiritualized, organizational teamwork?
- How do established Urantia Book based organizations work together to inform each Other of their work internationally or nationally, and are we willing to do this?
- How do we discern sincere truth-students from those who are more interested in monetary gain?
- What really supports the growth of sincere truth-students who are devoted to this book?
- How do we evaluate needs when we haven't been to a country and only know people through online communication?

Do these questions intrigue you? Do you have experiences to share and the desire to serve the International Fellowship Committee? We will enjoy your feedback and dedication.
