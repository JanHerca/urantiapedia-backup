International Conference 2023 (IC23): “Living the Teachings: Heart, Mind and Soul” (see [urantiabook.org/ic23](https://urantiabook.org/ic23)) is designed to be family friendly. The Children and Teen Program team, in collaboration with Urantia Family Life (UFL) and the Youth and Young Adult (Ya YA) Committee, is pleased to announce plans for a meaningful, creative, and fun-filled program for all ages.

This coordinated program will provide a variety of enriching experiences for the youth that also enables parents to attend plenaries and workshops. The age groups that have been created are as follows:
- Infants and Toddlers (ages 0-2)
- Preschoolers (ages 3-5)
- Preteens (ages 6-12)
- Teens (ages 13-18)

Note that accommodations and meals for kids under the age of 18 will be at no cost when they attend with an adult.

## Intergenerational Activities

We invite you to spend time with us in intergenerational musings. We are taking lessons from _The Urantia Book_ to have the various ages interact occasionally throughout the week. The worship sessions before the morning and afternoon plenaries are one of these all-ages activities, as well as the family game night. There are also moments throughout the week for the different age groups to spend time in reversion (relaxation and humor) and service opportunities. 

## Programming for Parents 

Urantia Family Life is curating a workshop series geared toward parents and all people interested in family life to include focuses on marriage, parenting, and religious culture. The team will also be organizing various social gatherings designed to foster engagement between parents, and to cultivate a stronger family life community within the readership of the Urantia Book community at large.

They are excited to welcome more of the unique perspectives and enthusiasm to share with the youth of the Urantia Book community during IC23 and beyond.
