Only 60 days to go for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Latin American Conference being held 1 – 4 November 2018 in Guarulhos, São Paulo, Brazil.

We are happy to report that so far 115 participants from 15 countries have registered for the event. This is a positive response from _The Urantia Book_ reader community and we believe our target of 150 participants will be easily surpassed. Even more promising, 21 young Urantia Book students aged between 14 and 30 have registered and are excited about participating and engaging with others about the fifth epochal revelation.

Everything you need to know about the conference can be found at the conference website at [https://www.urantiaconference.com](https://www.urantiaconference.com/). You can also register there.

The theme will be “Living the Teachings,” so this conference will provide a unique opportunity for students to come together in friendship and expand their understanding of the Urantia teachings as they explore ways to integrate them into day-to-day living.

This conference is being organised by the Urantia Association of Brazil, with support from many leaders from other Latin American Urantia Associations. It is sponsored by _Urantia Association International, Urantia Foundation and TruthBook and_ will be conducted in Portuguese, Spanish and English. It will also be possible to follow the presentations in one of these languages through a Zoom internet meeting room.

If you would like to help us to support this event, we are receiving donations to assist students of the book who cannot afford to participate in a conference. It has been proven that personal contact with fellow students of _The Urantia Book_ helps to stimulate enthusiasm for attending study groups and organizing reader gatherings on readers’ home turf. Your contributions will help us provide cross-cultural exchange and experience for active volunteers and emerging leaders and teachers, that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. All applications are carefully scrutinized before approval is given.

You can donate to this cause by visiting the Brazil Conference website at: [https://www.urantiaconference.com](https://www.urantiaconference.com/) and choose from the menu “More” and then “Donation” (or simply look for the “Donate” button at the footer of each page on the website.)

Your donations will be put to good use and are very much appreciated.

Please join us for this very special Latin American event. We’re looking forward to seeing you there.
