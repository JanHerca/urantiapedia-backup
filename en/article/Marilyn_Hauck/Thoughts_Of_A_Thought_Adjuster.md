> “_With these facts before them, it is our belief that the Monitors freely volunteer for assignment. Probably more than one Adjuster volunteers; perhaps the supervising personalized orders select from this group of volunteering Adjusters the one best suited to the task of spiritualizing and eternalizing the personality of the mortal candidate._” (<a id="a33_350"></a>[UB 108:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p1_7))

First, will I introduce myself. I hail from Divinington and I am a Thought Adjuster, Mystery Monitor, Divine Gift or whatever word designation may be applied to me by the children of the Universal Father. Experience is mine, I have looked through the eyes of evolutionary creatures before, and seen landscapes very different from those of Urantia. Twin suns have marched overhead, and the skies in other parts of the superuniverses are patterned with other constellations, other systems, But the love and purpose of the Father pulsed, always, through the whole.

I have a complete number — so complete that it is useless for mundane use. I think of myself as Thought Controller for that is the status I have been accorded in the mind that I indwell.

Some 48 years ago, I received notification of acceptance for indwelling. The candidate was to be born on Urantia, a far-out planet where Michael of Nebadon won his Master Sonship. I say no more of this subject except that he paid a full price for that promotion, and the local universe slang has denominated Urantia “the World of the Cross” ever since.

Joy was mine when I learned my application had been accepted, for the projected mortal mind and personality promised to be interesting and challenging. The primitiveness of the Urantian early development of will (by mandate of Michael of Nebadon), combined with the subtle and complex influences of the Seventh Master Spirit (representing Trinity in time and space), hinted a worthy undertaking. I had, of course, drawn up a destiny plan for my subject. And I say with judgment based on ample experience, that it forecast adventure — balancing all the elements of developmental evolutionary virtues with intellection, challenge, mystery, and romance. To attempt the manifestation of such a plan would fill this mortal child with elation. When there is added the stipulation of the indwellee's inviolate free will, my divine projection could become farce or high tragedy. After all, where did all the Greek plays originate?

As an experienced Father fragment, I knew that neither docility nor high spiritual receptivity is rampant on the young and distant life spheres. I therefore looked forward to the moment of indwelling with anticipatory love and patience. As a piece of the perfect Father I am naturally loving and patient, On the worlds of time and space I have learned _why_ I am these qualities. The Father chooses to experience all of every element of his nature in all and every time-space environment and personality. The Supreme Being actualizes in these accumulated experiences, Thus does my order serve a vital and special calling.

It happened when she was not quite five years old. Previously, the seven Adjutants had indicated the possibility of moral choosing. My subject exercised the choice — positively! How little she knew the implications of this moment. It did not even impress her conscious memory! I had my travel orders and sped from Divinington to Uversa (to register) and on to Urantia to take up residence with and in this precious mortal of a backward world. What an adventure we will have (by her choice)! What great events we can be a part of! Here is my world and commitment.

The years have flowed on. There's nothing like living in the mind of a person to know them. Naturally, I had the genetic and environmental projections and I was no newcomer to the business, But even so, my indwellee surprised me. There was the time she took an irrational dislike to a fellow mortal of similar spiritual progress. Human emotional conditioning can pop up strongly even after time and teaching. Then another time, under pressure, she grasped some of my most advanced material, and applied them to action in the physical world. It is a wonder! I am the perfection additive in the association, and my mortal causes me wonder. Such is the will of the omniscient Father.

I can work only with the positive. That is the stuff of reality. The negative can be turned into positive, as the Son of Man so amply proved, but such decisions must be made for good reason in the human heart. By such transactions is the Supreme powerized in the universes. So I seek to present positive applications for my subject's qualities. To her flexibility I try to manifest changes to more spiritual values and evaluations; to her humor, a relaxation of self-importance and wry recovery from seeming disaster. Her love of mysteries and puzzles has been used extensively to intrigue her into more and higher thought, Her discovery of _The URANTIA Book_ was just such an episode. I eagerly await the day when our communications are more straight-forward.

The day will come. I have even now been acknowledged formally as Thought Controller to my subject. In the white marble temple lit by a Delphic blue sky (that is her picture-myth of the superconscious), she gave me that name and charged me with the development of our soul child. Now I may carry out my original plan to its entirety of value and meaning. I am assured of eventual union and my own personality. Every day is a prelude to that day.

Part of my search is ended. Another part begins. Many evolutionary beings have I indwelt and loved to the full capacity of their recognition of that love. Always have I plucked at the edges of their receptivities and turned the tuning pegs of their insights yet a notch higher. Never have I failed, but this “non-failure” is the best and happiest. With what great potential for power has the Father endowed his mortal children. Do not fail to use your divine inheritance! Use it, I beseech you, to the fullest!

> “_As far as I am conversant with the affairs of a universe, I regard the love and devotion of a Thought Adjuster as the most truly divine affection in all creation. The love of the Sons in their ministry to the races is superb, but the devotion of an Adjuster to the individual is touchingly sublime, divinely Fatherlike. The Paradise Father has apparently reserved this form of personal contact with his individual creatures as an exclusive Creator prerogative._” (<a id="a55_468"></a>[UB 110:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p0_2))
