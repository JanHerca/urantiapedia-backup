It is rather difficult to think of Peggy Johnson without also thinking of her husband of 51 years, Dick. They were always together, or so it seemed, at Urantia conferences and activities. Peggy embarked upon the great universe adventure on February 23, 2002. Her graduation from Urantia was celebrated on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, at the Johnson's home in Phoenix, Arizona. There was a potluck, songs, and ceremony to bid her farewell.

It is also difficult to think of Peggy without thinking of the Arizona community, and the dedicated work for the Father she and Dick have undertaken over the years.

Their spiritual journey together was centered upon, but not confined to, their study of the Urantia Papers. Peggy and Dick hosted the second oldest study group in Phoenix. They both have been very active in AA, and they helped start the nation's oldest continuous shelter for abused families, Villa de Fidelis (House of Faith). Perhaps more important than a list of activities, Peggy did not simply read _The Urantia Book_, she lived the teachings.

The Spring issue of The Servant, the Grand Canyon Society's Newsletter, was devoted to touching tributes to Peggy. Those folks who knew her best wrote:

“Peggy will be sorely missed in the lives of many. Words can't begin to express what a wonderful, giving person she was. She was an inspiration to friends and family alike. The years will pass slowly now for those who mourn her loss. We look forward to seeing her on our Father's Mansion Worlds.”
