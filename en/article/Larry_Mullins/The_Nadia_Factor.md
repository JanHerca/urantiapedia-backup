***“I am having tears in my eyes ...”***

_“Especially you introduced me, my family, my cousins and my friends the ”Treasure of life“ the beautiful gift of life that changed our lives and now we have some purpose of life to live but before we were like dead bodies, we were empty from inside, we were seems to alive but having nothing that attracts others but thanked God now we have a special living purpose after having the UB with us. ... JJ, when sometimes I am writing e-mails to you or reading the UB, I am having tears in my eyes that how fortunate I am that I have something special with me and how much I am thankful to you that you shared with me.”_

In the last issue of _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ we printed several letters from Nadia of Pakistan to JJ. Nadia had many comments about _The Urantia Book_, and what it had come to mean to her. Who could not be moved by passages such as the two excerpted above?

Many readers were moved. And some wrote to her through JJ. And some, such as Ken Raveill and several Urantians in Kansas City, went the second mile. Below is a letter from Ken, referencing the work of his group to help the brave souls in Pakistan who dare to read and advocate the fifth epochal revelation.

_May 8, 2003_

_Hi Larry and Joan:_

_After reading Nadia's Letters in The Spiritual Fellowship Journal, I sent an email to J.J., whom I had known in Arizona. I told him how I appreciated what he was doing in Pakistan. He sent word back that he was soon (August) to leave Nadia and that study group for a new assignment. J.J. advised me how badly the Pakistan group needs additional books._

_I sent J.J. three parcels including one Urantia Book, an Index, a Paramony, How I Found The Urantia Book, and several other tracks and handouts. I later sent J.J. four copies of "Jesus: A New Revelation.” J.J. told me that Nadia had seen his copy of this printing of Part IV and so wanted one for herself and family._

_J.J. indicated that Nadia and family were very poor and used a large percentage of their meager income to promote _The Urantia Book_. I asked J.J. how could we help, and he indicated that they live on about $ 60 a month and that some financial help would me greatly appreciated. I discussed this with our study group and several members, including Bob and Linda Keller, wanted very much to help this struggling group in a Moslem country._

_However, I have been very cautious regarding sending materials to Pakistan. I do not want to be responsible for causing Nadia and family any problems with the government or any hostile parties there. J.J. has assured me that his APO is perfectly safe and that people who want to help can send anything to his address and be assured that there will be no problems for as long as he remains in Islamabad._

_J.J. has asked me not to send money until he finds out if Nadia can cash checks drawn on a US bank or if money orders would work. He tells me that he does not think mail or parcels coming from the US are opened or inspected, but he is not sure. He did suggest that I not send cash. So I am waiting on J.J. to give some instructions regarding money help._

_I have received $ 250 already for this project from members of the study group. I am sure more is available when needed._

_I am waiting on suggestions from J.J. to know how to proceed. Any advice you may have would be welcome. Best wishes._

Sincerely, Ken Raveill

JJ wrote Joan and I from Phoenix, expressing his pleasure that Ken and several others had taken the initiative and reached out to Nadia and her family. Here is a short excerpt from his letter: 

_“Nadia has gone more than the extra $10 KM in sharing our revelation without knowing how her food was going to be provided. I gave her the example about how our heavenly father provides food for the birds and not to be too concerned, that with her devotion to the spiritual path she has chosen our heavenly father is mindful of our temporal needs as well.”_

Urantians who want to reach out to Nadia through JJ can certainly do so. JJ's new email address is:

jj_6062003@yahoo.com

Visit with JJ about the possibilities ... surely notes and messages will be deeply appreciated.

JJ is a great Urantian Evangelist in my judgment. He never shirks from his duty of outreach to the spiritually hungry who are seeking something better. Nadia is one of those remarkable leaders who seem to emerge from nowhere to do important work. And Ken and his group, especially Bob and Linda Keller, have stepped up to play important roles in this historic episode.

Did I say _historic episode?_ Is this carrying the praise a little too far?

I think not. These “ordinary” Urantians have taken Urantian outreach and evangelism to another level. We should admire and applaud them. They exemplify the genius of the people.

> “As the Father sent me into this world, even so now send I you. You are all called to carry the good news to those who sit in darkness. This gospel of the kingdom belongs to all who believe it; it shall not be committed to the custody of mere priests. Soon will the Spirit of Truth come upon you, and he shall lead you into all truth. Go you, therefore, into all the world preaching this gospel, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the ages.” <a id="a80_458"></a>[UB 191:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p6_3)
