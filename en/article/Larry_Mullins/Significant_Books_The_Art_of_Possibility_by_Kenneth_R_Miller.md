When a poet and a scientist combine forces in an insightful and enlightened way, the result is an excellent book. “Ben” Zander is conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and “Ros” is a family therapist and landscape painter. The role of conductor may be the last bastion of the total dictator, but not for Zander. He is a genius at combining strong leadership and compassion. I found his methods and insights very helpful, especially for pragmatic application to professional demands on a creative personality. Zander discovered that his own conductor/leader's power was directly linked to how much greatness he was willing to grant others. A remarkable example is his vignette: “Leading from any Chair.” The Zanders invite us to all become compassionate communicators, leaders and performers whose lives radiate possibility to the world. Then, they show us how to do it!
