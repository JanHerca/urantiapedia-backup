There will come a time, I know, when Urantians will go forth into the world to establish a religion that belongs not to a race, a nation, nor to a special group of teachers or preachers.

These Urantian Leaders of the New Spiritual Renaissance will teach a gospel of the kingdom that belongs to both Jew and gentile, to rich and poor, to free and bond, to male and female, even to the little children. And Urantians will proclaim this gospel of love and truth by the lives which they live, for Jesus shall live again through them.

By observing these new Urantians, those who have not heard, shall hear, and those who have not seen, shall see the Master, and they will learn of his life-giving teachings.

There will come a time, I know, when Urantians shall love one another with a new and startling affection, even as Jesus loved all of us when he walked among us. And these new Urantians will serve humankind with a new and amazing devotion, even as Jesus served men and women when he lived in the flesh.

And when this hour comes, the new and everlasting religion of Jesus will at last blaze across the earth in the lives of the men and women who believe it.
