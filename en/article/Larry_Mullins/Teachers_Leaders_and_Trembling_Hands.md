The early Urantians were told, according to a memo written by Bill Sadler, Jr. in 1955, titled [_The Timing of The Urantia Book_](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate), that the Urantia Papers belonged to “the era immediately to follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle.” Fortunately for us, _The Urantia Book_ was not delayed until Russian Communism collapsed. The early Urantians were also told:

> _But the publication of the Book has not been postponed until that (possibly) somewhat remote date. An early publication of the Book has been provided so that it may be in hand for the training of leaders and teachers._

So it was that a great many Urantian servant-leaders and teachers in those earlier days were put on hold, so to speak. Moreover, the Urantia Movement itself developed a culture that became generally insular and inbred. There have been exceptions, of course. But those exceptions were usually individuals who blazed their own trails, defied conventional wisdom, and who ploughed new ground. These lonesome Urantian missionaries may have taken some small comfort in the final words of Bill Sadler's memo:

> _You who dedicate your lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood can little realize the import of your doings. You will doubtless live and die without realizing you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion on this world._

Once more, there were exceptions to this statement. Many of the early teachers and servant-leaders seemed to have an intuition that they were laboring for a great religious cause. Perhaps none of our earlier teachers and servant-leaders had a grand vision of our task that surpassed the vision of Dr. Meredith Justin Sprunger. And now, after 10 years of publishing _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_, Dr. Sprunger passes the torch to other readers. He will be there for us still, but he will generally entrust this vineyard to other hands. I confess that my hands are trembling as I accept a role in the task of continuing _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_. Because, in my own view, _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ has been a beacon of light on what is generally a dark and bleak horizon. I tremble because Meredith and Irene Sprunger, Merlyn Cox, Bud Bromley, Judy Smith, and Jack Williams are a difficult team to follow.

The Journal will not change in format or in its mission. New teachers and servant-leaders must, however, come forth into the vineyard that has been so lovingly cultivated and prepared for us by Dr. Sprunger and the editorial team of the Journal. We are called to take this treasure and to seek to bring _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ to a new level for a new millennium.

Where are these new teachers and servant-leaders who are equal to this task to be found?

Actually, they abound within the Urantia Movement. I became acquainted with some of them when Meredith and I were preparing _A History of the Urantia Papers_. And there are more, a great many more Urantians, with great gifts to offer and no clear path of service before them. These Urantians are usually not found in the familiar list of speakers at conferences. Their articles are rarely printed in official publications. They are not often called upon or sought out for counsel about the future of the Revelation. Yet, these forgotten believers may well represent the bright and shining future of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

Some of these forgotten Urantians have been around a very long time, and others are quite young. Some have quietly served, or are serving, in the Urantia Brotherhood, the Fellowship, the IUA, and the Foundation. Some have yet to be called upon. Some are Americans, and some serve in other countries.

The hour has come for these unheralded Urantian servant-leaders and teachers. The time has come to step out of the closet and, with deeds, not words, proclaim themselves to be Urantian servant-leaders. There is a hungry and forlorn flock to be fed outside of the small and circumscribed Urantian culture. There are articles to be written, eager young ears to be filled with the glory of the new and everlasting religion of Jesus. There are multimedias to be created, books to be written, churches to be built. There are some _Living the Teachings_ groups to be started, and untold tasks before us.

Urantians are united by a shared vision of the Mission of the Urantia Papers. Each of us carries a part of that vision, and the composite will be formed by the “Genius of the People.” Our circle will be as broad as necessary to include each person of good will. Our politics will be simply and solely the greatest good for all concerned. Our religion will be Urantian.

Over six decades ago it was written, “_Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment._” (<a id="a58_206"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)) Over six decades is a long time for Urantians to quiver. Many Urantians are now looking within, and they hear a still, small voice saying: “_Arise now, I have need of you. Go forth._”

As the Master stated on <a id="a60_24"></a>[UB 155:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_5): “_The religion of the spirit leaves you forever free to follow the truth wherever the leadings of the spirit may take you. And who can judge-perhaps this spirit may have something to impart to this generation which other generations have refused to hear?_”
