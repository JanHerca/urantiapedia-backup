There are many great Urantians out there who are not being used ... and you may be one of them. Do you have a story to tell? The Journal welcomes stories and articles from Urantians. We are most interested in first hand outreach experiences, such as Ken Raveill's article in this issue, “_Let's Go Public,_” and Micah Kruger's stirring: “_A Service Adventure in Guatemala._” ***We are especially interested in Urantians who have not had an opportunity to be heard***. Outreach stories such as J.J. Johnson's courageous efforts in Islamabad are welcome ... (see “Our Urantian in Pakistan”) as well as brilliant and informed perspectives such as Donald Briglia's article: “_Quantum Mysteries & the Urantia Papers._” Creative ideas for secondary works such as Tom and Karen Allen's “_Compare_” are most valuable. We plan to begin a column for Urantian Youth soon, and want to hear from this greatly under-valued and under-used source and perspective. ***Finally there is a wealth of golden riches among senior Urantians*** ... Helena Sprague, who is a Urantia Foundation Trustee Emeritus, and who served on the Urantia Brotherhood General Council, wrote us recently about this. She hosts a Senior Seminars group, and (with Bill Rocap) a “Shared Perceptions” group for seniors. With 46 years of close involvement with the Urantia Papers, who can imagine the value of her insights and ideas? ***Where are the great Urantian Leaders and Teachers?*** They are here, now. They have long too long — been silent. We seek nonpolitical and grounded insights and ideas regardless of your position, affiliation or lack of same. We seek to tap the gathered power of “ordinary” Urantians ... _the genius of the people_. Are you destined to be one of the great Urantian leaders and teachers for this day and this generation? ***If not you, then who?***
