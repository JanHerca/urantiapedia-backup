Plato observed that ideas such as truth, beauty, and goodness are more “real” than the actual material world in which we live. Modern philosophers have generally brushed that concept off. “Platonic” is a term that has come to mean unrealistically idealistic.

Now _The Urantia Book_ gives us an astounding new perspective. Plato was closer to the truth than many of us may have thought. We read in the Urantia Papers that fact — material existence — is only one aspect of reality. Matter is stuff in the constant process of perfecting, of becoming more and more “real.” The perfect pattern that matter is seeking to achieve is found on the Isle of Paradise. We understand divine perfection more easily as values — truth-beauty-goodness — all of which combine as love. Values are “bytes” of Divinity.

Another way of saying this is: fact is _what is_, and values (or Spirit) are what _ought to be_. Between what is, and what ought to be, is the dynamic process of becoming — living (or emerging) reality. What we call “reality” is thus always in the process of change, it must ever be redefined. That which is perfect, the Paradise pattern, is indeed more real than what we see; life is but the shadow of spirit realities.

We read in _The Urantia Book_ that God the Supreme (the evolving aspect of Deity) is to the _Paradise Trinity_ what the human soul is to the _Thought Adjuster_ (indwelling Spirit of God). (p. 1285) Just as the Supreme is being created, the soul is also in the process of becoming. The gift of personality is the _reality_ that makes it possible for mortals to _choose_. Between the God-endowed personality and the Thought Adjuster lies the enchanted loom upon which the mortal soul is woven by means of human choices. The mortal personality becomes more and more real as it chooses higher spiritual realities. These spiritual choices are recorded within the soul-the material-spirit “mind” — which the reconsciousized personality will take up after death.

_What does this mean in our day to day lives?_

It means that as we identify more and more with our personality essence through wise choices, _we become more and more real_. As we become more real we can better “hear” the voice of the indwelling Spirit of God, and more and more identify with, and _use_ our immortal soul in day to day living. The indwelling Spirit of God is objective reality, and when we achieve union with it we bring something new, something human, something won from our struggles in experiential reality to this divine-human union. _This is our gift to God._

In my job as a business consultant, I observe that businesses are more and more recognizing the _reality_ and significance of values. Values are _reality-potentials_. Values represent what _ought to be_. By lifting high values and honoring them, businesses target a company Mission — something seemingly “unattainable,” yet worth striving to achieve. Businesses can evaluate where they are — _facts_ — visualize where they _ought to be_ — _values_ — and in striving to attain their Mission, business associates give their activities, and their business culture new meaning.

***Thus, we can better understand the “new reality”-the “living truth” of Jesus***. In _The Urantia Book_, fact is observed as Beauty, value as Goodness, or spiritual potential, and meanings are perceived as emerging _Truth, living Truth_.

Values are the ultimate measure by which we should guide our lives. Science has discovered that chaos is brought into a meaningful pattern by what they call the “strange attractor,” something that configures apparently meaningless activity into a cohesive, and beautiful pattern. _This is how the supreme power of values works in the material world_.

Values are indeed more real than ordinary life, especially more real than a life that worships only material reality. A life that is merely successful is wasted. We must learn to see life as _what is becoming_, and less as what it _seems to be_. Recall the Man of La Mancha, Don Quixote. When admonished that he must come to terms with life “as it is” he replied:

> I have lived nearly fifty years, and I have seen life as it is. Misery, pain, hunger — cruelty beyond belief. I have heard the singing from taverns, and the moans from filth in the streets. I have been a soldier, and have seen my comrades fall in battle or die more slowly under the lash in Africa. I have held them in my arms in the final moments. These were men who saw life as it is, and yet they died despairing. No brave words, no gallant sayings. Only in their eyes a confusion, and whimpering the question: “Why?” I do not think they asked why they were dying, but why they had lived. When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Too much sanity may be madness! To surrender dreams, this may be madness. To seek treasure, where there is only trash. But maddest of all, to see life as it is, and not as it ought to be!

Thus, we may understand the thrilling new truth that Jesus taught the apostles, and only James grasped at first: They were to _live life as though they were ambassadors of a glorious earth kingdom of light and life ***that already exists***_. (<a id="a58_244"></a>[UB 140:8.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_25)) All true members of the kingdom of God should live as such noble ambassadors, for the gospel of Jesus reveals to us that the Father's spiritual family is to be found within the eternal now.
