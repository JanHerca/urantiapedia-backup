Note: The term “Meta-Values” was coined originally by Abraham Maslow. Dr. Maslow believed a “Science of Values” should be developed, an idea that has yet to be realized. Urantians can readily grasp the concept of MetaValues, and can use it to improve their ability to live the teachings of the Urantia Papers.

> “Truth, Beauty and Goodness form a triad of terms which have been discussed together throughout the tradition of western thought. They have been called 'transcendental' on the ground that everything which is, is in some measure or manner subject to denomination as true or false, good or evil, beautiful or ugly. But they have also been assigned to special spheres of being or subject matter-the true to thought and logic, the good to action and morals, the beautiful to enjoyment and aesthetics. They have been called 'the three fundamental values' with the implication that the worth of anything can be exhaustively judged by reference to these three standards ....”[^1]

> “The goal of humanistic studies was defined as the good, the beautiful, and the true....”[^2]

> “By experiencing something-such as goodness, truth and beauty-by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his uniqueness — by loving him.... by love we are enabled to see the essential traits and features of the beloved person; and even more, to see that which is potential in him; which is not yet actualized but which ought to be actualized .... ” [^3]

> “The concept of truth might possibly be entertained apart from personality, the concept of beauty may exist without personality, but the concept of divine goodness is understandable only in relation to personality. Only a person can love and be loved. Even beauty and truth would be divorced from survival hope if they were not attributes of a personal God, a loving Father... Truth, beauty, and goodness are divine realities, and as man ascends the scale of spiritual living, these supreme qualities of the Eternal become increasingly co-ordinated and unified in God, who is love.”[^4]

## Meta-Values and How They Can Change Your Life

Understanding how to work with Meta-Value energies can be as important as anything a Urantian will ever learn. Meta-Values can continuously point you in the right direction, ceaselessly inspire growth choices, and unfailingly energize you beyond any material force or agency. The concept of Meta-Values is woven throughout the Papers of _The Urantia Book_. Urantian scholars are now pulling together the information and ideas about Meta-Values from the Urantia Papers, and developing them into pragmatic applications that will change lives.

The four pivotal quotes at the beginning of this article are distilled from over twenty-five years of the study of values and Meta-Values. These quotes deserve careful consideration, for they represent insights of three of the great minds of this century, and they provide a keystone of the evolutionary human knowledge about Meta-Values. This human foundation is enriched and expanded by the revelatory information provided in the Urantia Papers. From this composite of evolutionary knowledge and revelation, the following cascading set of premises of an expanded theory of Meta-Values can be formulated.

- 1) The transcendental Meta-Values are Truth, Beauty, and Goodness. Of these three, Goodness may be said to be most accessible and personal because it relates most clearly to, and can best be understood through, personal relationships.
- 2) All three Meta-Values may be said to be unified and understood in the ultimate Meta-Value, which is Love.
- 3) The source of Meta-Values is the Highest Power in the universe, God the Father, who may also best be understood by the concept of Love. Meta-Values — Truth, Beauty, Goodness and Love — in computer jargon may be said to provide deity “bytes” that help make God understandable.
- 4) God is contactable within our minds and hearts as the Thought Adjuster. We draw upon his energy and insight most readily by means of exercising our highest and most enlightened skills of Meta-Value recognition. These recognition skills are directly related to our maturity, and become increasingly effective as we make circle-progress, or “actualize.”
- 5) It is by means of these Meta-Value insights that we are set free in the inner life to use our visionary creative skills to the highest degree, limited only by our faith.
- 6) Creative imagination, energized and inspired by MetaValues, is the tool by which your mind and your will may visualize and propose a better life, and set into motion the mental and physical processes for achieving it.
- 7) Your ultimate human freedom is the incontestable right you have to choose your own attitudes when confronted by any given situation. Meta-Values facilitate greater insight and perspective so that you can make and act out, in the face of any other alternative, choices of growth and freedom in preference to choices of fear and avoidance. Growth choices are decisions which are completed by means of faith-actions, and faith-actions are activities which in turn move us toward actualization, more life, and higher realities.

## Freedom and Responsibility

The seven cascading premises of Meta-Values, when put into action, lead us to what Jesus called a place of spiritual advantage, a condition of freedom and responsibility: freedom, in the sense of sovereignty to choose — and responsibility in the sense that we are accountable for our choices. Each of these premises have been demonstrated as viable, and are illustrated in the Urantia Papers as theory, and by means of the authentic life experiences of Jesus of Nazareth. I do not claim this interpretation to be infallible or irrefutable, but rather that it is reasonable and consistent, and it is worthy of careful examination for any Urantian who longs for peace and freedom.

However, Meta-Values may as well not exist for those who do not put them into action. To “come alive” MetaValues require an expert practitioner who will dare to put them to use. Exactly how do Meta-Values work? How do we apply Meta-Values to our lives?

## Three Things are Essential to Activate Meta-Values in Our Lives

- 1) _Insight_. Insight is the intellectual gateway by which the spiritual energy of Meta-Values enters the mind. We must open our minds to the experience of Meta-Values as realities — not as platitudes, or furniture for our minds. We must perceive values as power-factors with limitless potential. We need a personal, living, growing, inner core of MetaValues — not the “Sunday morning” values that too many Urantians have in common with many church-goers.
- 2) _Faith-Action_. We must take Faith-Actions to make Meta-Values visible to others. Even God cannot guide a docked boat or steer a parked car. We must learn to foster wise, balanced growth decisions. Yet we must decide boldly, and know that a decision is never complete until it has been acted out. Viktor Frankl's precious Meta-Value insights would have never inspired future generations had he not put them into action to defeat the evil of the Nazi death camp. When told her mission in India had helped thousands of people, Mother Teresa replied to the effect that: “If I had never picked up my first diseased and hungry person, and held and comforted him, I would never have picked up thirty-five thousand of them.” Indeed, Faith-Action is the process by which we actualize Meta-Values, or make the reality of Meta-Values visible for others. Faith is a gift from the Highest Power; Faith-Action is the human response to this gift which validates its acceptance. Faith-Action is the wondrous leap Urantians must take into the sublime uncertainty that seems to continually confront us.
- 3) _Lightness, or In the Zone_. To be in the zone means we are poised between Confidence and Compassion. We are actively-centered, or dynamically-balanced. This is a state of energized harmony between meta-action and metareflection. This may also be considered a state of great lightness, immeasurable peace, or energized joy. Balance is the platform from which Faith-Action may be launched; integrity is manifested when our actions match our core values. We cannot be “light” and “in the zone” if we carry burdens of guilt, resentment, excessive self regard, and fear, or are overly concerned about results.

In this article I will offer ideas on the action process, and how to apply the Meta-Value solution to ourselves and our lives. However, I want to go beyond a “call to action.” Many pop psychology books urge us to action, explaining psychological tricks and methods to temporarily “un-paralyze” the will and give it a confidence-booster to enable it to assert itself through action.

The Urantia philosophy concerning Meta-Values is a quest for a permanent healing of our fears, a state of spiritual advantage in which we are poised for active, productive responses to the continuous opportunities and challenges of secular life.

## Continuous Operation in “The Zone” of Spiritual Insight

Now let's examine the three factors by which we set into motion the process of aligning with the Meta-Values that will lift us to this superb state of peace and freedom. These are: Insight, Faith-Action and Lightness. In “The Life and Teachings of Jesus” we have a model of a circle-achieving (or self-actualizing) person as one who is dynamically balanced between compassion for others, or Goodness, and action — the process of the manifestation of the will of the Father through self-actualization.

In other words, we may reasonably define a circleachieving or self-actualizing person as an individual of both supreme self-confidence and deep sensitivity to the needs of others. Such a person makes courageous growth choices that are modulated with concerns about how these choices will affect others. However, most psychologists who study human potential have estimated that less than two percent of the population may be considered to be self-actualizing. Another three percent are active and aggressive, but lack compassion for others — tending to be ruthless and ends-oriented. We mortals must draw most of our leaders from this five percent composite of people who are confident enough to believe they have something to offer to the world.

About 95% of the general population is essentially reactive, and lack the assertive-conviction to be proactive: to set goals, make plans, and set them into motion. That is, 95% of people are impeded by a lack of belief about their own self-worth, and so they are figuratively “standing around,” waiting for something to happen, while they, as Jesus described, resent and regret the past, whine over the present, and dread the future. The loss of the creative possibilities of non-actualizing people is unimaginable. What is the spiritual solution to this syndrome of self-defeat that has plagued humanity for untold centuries? Indeed, beyond psychology and theory, what are the spiritual deficiencies that cause us to shrink from fulfilling our destinies? Why does the Will-to-Fail overrun our spiritual goals and crush so many worthy projects and aspirations?

> _In other words, we may reasonably define a circleachieving or self-actualizing person as an individual of both supreme self-confidence and deep sensitivity to the needs of others. Such a person makes courageous growth choices that are modulated with concerns about how these choices will affect others._

The Urantia Papers assure us that spiritual insight will yield the answers we need to these questions. More important, spiritual insight will tell us why we, as individuals, generally operate from fear rather than faith. Spiritual insight is a continuous process, a gift that emerges unconsciously, and is most favorably nurtured by one or more of three general activities:

- 1) _Service to Humankind_. Service done with a loving, wholehearted, and selfless attitude. According to the Urantia Papers, loving service is the shortest, surest path to the place of spiritual advantage that favors spiritual insight. (p. 1000) Such insight emerges effortlessly as we “forget ourselves” in loving, unselfish service, or a noble mission that is more important than self.
- 2) _Regular, Meditative Prayer_. Spiritual insight can also be facilitated or augmented by means of relaxation and receptivity through meditative prayer. We can also define this activity as a conscious effort to align with the realityforces of the universe, as described in detail in the Rodan section of the Urantia Papers.
- 3) _Hitting Bottom_. A peak-experience, at a moment of total despair, has set the stage for a down-grasp of spiritual insight that may lead to a lifetime of dedication to a project or cause that is more important than self.

Regardless of how a spiritual insight occurs, we know that the human will is necessary to capture a spiritual insight and bring it to the material level manifestation or actualization by means of action. Jesus taught the human will-to-do emerges from self-respect, and the conviction that one can do, and that we have something worthwhile to offer. We believe our action will have meaning. When the will-to-do merges with the belief that one-can-do, the composite manifests itself as an assertive drive to be proactive and make something happen. Yet pure assertiveness, regardless of its justification, could ruthlessly overrun and exploit other people, absolving itself by declaring that the “the ends justify the means.” Clearly, assertiveness is a necessary quality, but something else is needed if we are to be aligned with Meta-Values. Jesus saw this clearly: “In bringing men into the kingdom, do not lessen or destroy their self-respect. While overmuch self-respect may destroy proper humility and end in pride, conceit, and arrogance, the loss of self-respect often ends in paralysis of the will. It is the purpose of this gospel to restore self-respect to those who have lost it and to restrain it in those who have it. Make not the mistake of only condemning the wrongs in the lives of your pupils; remember also to accord generous recognition for the most praiseworthy things in their lives. Forget not that I will stop at nothing to restore self-respect to those who have lost it, and who really desire to regain it.” (<a id="a93_1531"></a>[UB 159:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_3))

## The Will-To-Do-Plus the Will-To-Do Good Things

> _True religion demands that we **do** something. Our Indwelling Spirit has an ideal plan for our lives. The primary requirements of this plan are loving fellowship and creative action, both of which achieve their highest expression in service. Following the guidance of the spirit is never easy; it pushes us to our limits. Our responsibility is to act; the results are worked out in the divine overcontrol of creative evolution. Eternal truth, transcendent beauty, unceasing goodwill, and boundless love will conquer the world!_ [^5]

Furthermore assertiveness, even assertiveness of extreme magnitude, is “pulled” into the effective “zone” when it is balanced and modulated by goodness-compassion and respect for others. Assertiveness or aggressiveness, when modulated and orchestrated by an equal measure of benevolence, effectively align an individual with the creative flow of the universe — the Meta-Value energies. However, assertiveness or aggressive acts which lack compassion (or Goodness) may be defined as attempts to bend the reality of the universe to one's own will and desires. The core motivation for one driven by raw assertiveness is always self-interest usually manifested as power, money, or glory. In a spiritual sense, it is important to understand that “the zone” is best achieved when we are dynamically balanced between compassion and assertiveness. Jesus taught that we acquire this productive dynamic balance by cultivating our weaker characteristic, not by repressing our stronger one. For example, a person who is excessively compassionate and allows himself to be exploited should strive to cultivate assertiveness and enlightened self-interest, rather than seeking to curb his sensitiveness and consideration of others.

> _Daring deeds, Faith-Actions, are not only feasible, they are necessary to keep in alignment with the flow of energy toward the source of all things._

When I was a young man, I had a different problem. I struggled with my aggressive nature. I tried to curb and stifle it. In later years I learned from the teachings of Jesus that assertiveness and even aggressiveness can be wonderful gifts when modulated with an appropriate degree of compassion for others. What I lacked was a mature, authentic consideration and respect for people. When I learned to cultivate a sincere concern for my fellow children of God, I began to notice an immediate “change” in the attitudes of other people toward me. No longer did I feel resisted and hampered at every turn; people began to help me.

## The Will-to-Beauty and the Will-to-Goodness

An enlightened will-to-do could be expressed in spiritual terms as the Will-to-Beauty. The enlightened will-to-do is the desire to manifest Beauty, and this is a natural, energetic drive that needs to be orchestrated, not curbed. The Will-toBeauty is, however, manifested in a material domain.

> _Assertiveness or aggressiveness, when modulated and orchestrated by an equal measure of benevolence, effectively align an individual with the creative flow of the universe-the Meta-Value energies._

Ends, even beautiful ends, are never justified by flawed means, and the Will-to-Goodness, or compassion for others, is the necessary modulating ingredient for the Willto-Beauty. Together, the Will-to-Beauty and the Will-toGoodness synthesize as Love in action, the ultimate zone of dynamic alignment with the Truth of Meta-Values. In this zone we may safely act in virtually complete freedom. Love, the highest reality, may be said to be made visible by means of Faith-Actions.

And yet, when an individual achieves an optimum degree of self-respect and respect for others, from a cosmic perspective she is more than simply “safe.” She is in sync with the cosmic flow of emerging reality of a benevolent universe, and thus creative and immensely effective actions are possible. Life-changing growth decisions can be made and acted out. Daring deeds, Faith-Actions, are not only feasible, they are necessary to keep in alignment with the flow of energy toward the source of all things.

Faith-Actions are dramatic moves that could not be predicted by those who know us, for they are the result of synergy, rather than energy. Energy alone cannot do it. Faith alone, without the works, cannot do it. When the energy and passion of self-respect is aligned with faith, the resulting activity “enters the zone” and achieves harmony and synchronism. Spiritual insight has then become the most powerful and aggressive force on the face of the earth — spiritual drive. This is not an emotional state, but rather a state of unfathomable peace. Spiritual drive is so unimaginably powerful because it is activity that is aligned with the reality factors that drive the universe: Meta-Values.

## How We Know We are in the Zone — the “Lightness” Test

How can we Urantians be sure our actions are faithdriven? How can we be certain whether we are operating in sync with the flow of Meta-Values? Fortunately, we have been given an inner, infallible gauge that operates instantly in the inner life. When the world turns gray and “dangerous” and our energies flag, we are out of the zone. When we are hysterically energetic, and the world seems to obstruct and frustrate everything we try to do, we are too far into aggression and out of the zone. When we feel exploited, drained and used, when we allow our rights to be overrun, we are into an unwise degree of “goodness.” To the extent we experience lightness, self-forgetfulness, timelessness, inexpressible joy and peace, we are in the zone. When doors fly open and remarkable “coincidences” help us, and the world moves aside for us to offer our gift, we are in the zone. Rodan expressed these concepts in these beautiful words:

“Jesus has taught us that God lives in man; then how can we induce man to release these soul-bound powers of divinity and infinity? How shall we induce men to let go of God that he may spring forth to the refreshment of our own souls while in transit outward and then to serve the purpose of enlightening, uplifting, and blessing countless other souls? How best can I awaken these latent powers for good which lie dormant in your souls? One thing I am sure of: Emotional excitement is not the ideal spiritual stimulus. Excitement does not augment energy; it rather exhausts the powers of both mind and body. Whence then comes the energy to do these great things? Look to your Master. Even now he is out in the hills taking in power while we are here giving out energy. The secret of all this problem is wrapped up in spiritual communion, in worship. From the human standpoint it is a question of combined meditation and relaxation. Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines the capacity for spiritual receptivity. And this interchange of strength for weakness, courage for fear, the will of God for the mind of self, constitutes worship.” (<a id="a121_1170"></a>[UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1))
