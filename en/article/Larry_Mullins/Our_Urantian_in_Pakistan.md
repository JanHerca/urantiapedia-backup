Hi JJ,

How are you doing sir? I am fine by the grace of mighty Lord and hope the same from you. JJ I am very happy to receive beautiful e-mails from different Urantian people, and I love to reply them all. JJ me and my family are so happy that you are doing really good for me, believe me in my life we didn't have anyone like you, and I can't get some one like you in my life but I pray from God to have some one like you in my life, kind, God fearing and helpful person.

Especially you introduced me, my family, my cousins and my friends the “Treasure of life” the beautiful gift of life that changed our lives and now we have some purpose of life to live but before we were like dead bodies, we were empty from inside, we were seems to alive but having nothing that attracts others but thanked God now we have a special living purpose after having the UB with us. Me and my family members can't forget your greatness in our lives. You are really an angel for us.

JJ, the man who took the responsibility of the translation, he refused to do that because he is a fundamentalist so I given it to someone else who did it for me. Now I got the translation with me, JJ we are giving your both articles in the newspaper and will give as it is one article because you know it is only a Christian newspaper. So we can put it in the newspaper as it is one, so now we got the booking for the newspaper so I hope that we can see our article very soon. JJ, this country and the religions people have to do the things by force, they can't do what they like the most in their lives by their freewill. So gradually everyone will know about the truth, but it takes some time very slow.

JJ, you don't forget to talk to your friend Jerry in (NHS) narcotics, just make him remind again about my problems and all that I am a poor Christian fellow and having lots of problems. JJ we will have a beautiful Urantia study group tommorrow, so see you tommorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

God bless you,

Nadia

Dearest JJ,

I discussed with you this afternoon about what is my next planning, B. my my friend and also a Urantian, was thinking that as she have the “Treasure of Life” with her, she is already sharing with others, but I am glad that she discussed with me that she loves to share a religious revelation of epochal significance to our planet, with her old parents who are living in the village, she thinks that they are very old so before they die, she loves to help them by providing the truth epochal revelation of life. I need to go with her with all my lessons that you are giving me every week, I mean the study we are doing together, I have some of them in Urdu Translation and will have more till I move to the village. I hope that me and B., will able to share the Heavenly Father's love and the Spirit of Truth with the people in the village and with B.'s Friends.

The village is very far from here, it takes to reach there like eight hours from here, but no problem, I am ready to have any challenge for my beautiful UB, I am planning to take two Urantia Books with me to place in some library there, and when later on I will have some study group there, I will try to send them the Urdu Translation, after every week and try to visit them every month, because they will be the new students and will need me to share with them more.

We need your prayers because it is our new mission to Introduce the UB in villages with very poor people. JJ, now day by day our study group is increasing, like now we have the Teenagers group [names deleted]. I hope that one day every one will have this Epochal Revelation of Truth with them.

Peace & Joy

Nadia.

Hi JJ,

Thanked God that our article of UB is published in the newspaper, all my family members and all the Urantians are very happy to see our article and especially because of that people will read our article and will take interest and believe on UB. As you know that this country is Islamic country and also too much fundamentalist people are living here, so its very hard to do these kind of things and also very slow to introduce something, so we have to be very careful and also to have a patience to introduce the Epochal Revelation of Truth.

On Friday night, the lady who was helping me alot for the article, she called the press to confirm that what happened? the article is publish or not? someone told her that the article is published but they didn't published the website of UB and the email address, because of some priest and fundamentalist people, so she requested [name deleted] to help her before the distribution of the newspaper in all Pakistan. Otherwise the publishing of article is useless, so [name deleted] decided to write the website of the UB, and the email address under the article with hand writing in all newspapers, and did that on around 7000-8000 newspaper all Friday night. JJ, I believe that God and Angels are helping us alot.I hope that next time for the other article, God will help us alot, that lady promised me that will publish the other article by the next month.

Much Love,

Nadia.

**Subject: Great Idea**

JJ,

Me and B. are trying very hard to move to the village in the mid of this month, we have enough Urdu translation to share this Epochal Revation of Truth, and Heavenly Father's love with our sisters and brothers in poor village. We all have a great idea and a plan that in beginning we will talk about our Heavenly Father's Love, Truth, and the Life and Teachings of Jesus. As I told you that the poor people are more receptive so we have to be very slow with them and should start it with the IV part. Yesterday B. had given the UB to her nephew who was interested in UB, as he felt that we all are the believer and very much enthusiastic for the UB.

Anyways, I hope that God will help us to continue our mission, because we have a good purpose of this loving service. Hope to listen from you soon.

Love & Prayers,

Nadia.

Hi JJ,

I had a good study group last evening, after coming from your place, with [names deleted]. B. did not come because of she was not feeling well. I tried to explain them about Melchizedek our third Epochal Revelation, they all like to listen about Melchizedek. My brother was very happy to hear that our heavenly father have a special love for us. I am very blessed and fortunate that I got this beautiful “Treasure of Life” and especially I am very thankful to you that you are really giving me a lot of your precious time and sharing the heavenly father s love and teaching me about _The Urantia Book_. I will never forget your greatness in my whole life that I was thirsty for truth and there was no charm in my life, it was empty and was bored but you introduced me this true Epochal Revelation and its changed my life. When my heavenly father felt mercy on me and send this Treasure for me so I am sharing the Heavenly father s love with all my spiritual sisters and brothers on this planet.

JJ, when sometimes I am writing e-mails to you or reading the UB, I am having tears in my eyes that how fortunate I am that I have something special with me and how much I am thankful to you that you shared with me.

Your sister in faith,

Nadia.

**Subject: It's a difficult task but**

Hi JJ,

JJ I had a good visit with some friends in Islamabad. I am very happy that today I got a chance to discuss with some people about the UB. Sir, whenever someone meets all my family members, first of all we would like to share UB with them whether they like to listen that any more or not. I am always holding the UB with me so some people like to ask me that what's this? so like this I can have the chance to talk about the UB. I hope to see a majority of people in a few years that they will reconize this Epochal Revelation of Truth here in Pakistan.

Now I just finished talking to [name deleted], so I asked him that what about my article? is it coming tommorrow in the newspaper or not? so he asked me its really very hard to publish religious stuffs in the any newspaper, only Islamic matters can be publish easily, so he explained me that if they are going to publish the article as it is then they would be in great difficulty so they have to change that little bit and have to edit the article, they have to change the heading also, so the religious people cannot be angry on the news paper staff, he explained me that they could be hang or could be in the jail forever or they could be fire from their services so its really a big risk, sir, they have to change the article otherwise I could be in big trouble so...... he told me that the circulation of the newspaper is about like 7,000 people around Pakistan. The article will be in tommorrow news paper and it is going in all embassies and all government departments and in all book stores. The other article will be publish today and hope to see that tommorrow morning and when she will call me, and will show me the article along with its website and email address.

I have to explain my brother and my all family members about the billion worlds of Havona, because my brother needs to know about it again. Me and other urantians are so happy that our articles of the UB is now in the different news papers, its just the beginning and hope to see it is spreading in all the world. (That is my dream) and hope that one day it will come true.

Love and Prayers,

Nadia
