In October, Joan and I had the privilege of attending the Heart of America Urantia Conference at Unity Village, Missouri. Beautiful grounds, excellent food, accommodations, planning and facilities were featured. It was an opportunity to meet some new friends and renew our relationships with some fine Urantians. The theme was Daily Walking with our Adjusters, and the conference adhered faithfully to the teachings of the Urantia Papers. No hocus-pocus, no channeling, just stimulating and inspiring messages from readers who know their stuff. The conference was organized by Susan Cook, who was ably supported by the Heart of America society of readers. It was wonderful; I had forgotten how great old-fashioned Urantia conferences could be. We need more of them.
