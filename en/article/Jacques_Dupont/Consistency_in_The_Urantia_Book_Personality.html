<p>Consistency in The Urantia Book: Personality.
From a paper by Jacques Dupont, Recloses, France</p>
<p>Even for an author writing about recorded facts, consistency is difficult to maintain in a work as extensive as The Urantia Book. For hypothetical authors seeking to foist a fake revelation upon the world—hence relying upon their imagination— maintaining consistency would be a nightmare task. For authors presenting revelatory truth, even upon difficult topics where ambiguity intrudes, recipients of a revelation would justifiably have the expectation of a high degree of consistency.</p>
<p>The topic for this issue, “personality”  would have a “top ten” rating for degree of difficulty in maintaining consistency. There are more than 1000 references in the book from which to form a judgment. Those presented are mostly from a paper by Jacques Dupont, which was written to elucidate the topic of personality, but not specifically from the point of view of consistency. Judgment on consistency is in the hands of the reader. It is probably easier to look out for inconsistencies than to attempt a consistency analysis. Now from Jacque’s paper:</p>
<p>A dictionary definition of “personality” is: That which defines the individuality of a moral person.
And for psyche: The function through which a conscious person understands himself as a self, a unique and permanent individual.</p>
<p>What is personality? One answer given in The Urantia Book that needs to be kept in mind is: “Personality is one of the unsolved mysteries of the universes.” (70-3) The book also tells us that: “The Universal Father is the secret of the reality of personality, the bestowal of personality, and the destiny of personality,” (8-5) that, “the personality of the spirit Son is the master pattern for all personality throughout all universes,” (1263-1) and that, “Havona is the home of the pattern personality of every mortal type.” (162-3)</p>
<p>We learn also that, “the Creator-Son uses the creatures of Havona as personality-pattern possibilities for his own mortal children,” (162-3) and the Creator-Sons themselves are, “perfect personalities, even the pattern for all local universe personality.” (28-3)</p>
<p>In The Urantia Book, personality and pattern are so closely linked that it would seem to be valid to assume, on occasion, that personality is pattern rather than personality has pattern. Perhaps that is part of the mystery.</p>
<p>We must be careful about how we interpret the word “pattern.” The master pattern for a car, for example, may still give rise to an enormous variety of cars that look and behave differently due to the addition, modification, or removal of components that leave the basic pattern unchanged.</p>
<p>The concept of personality as pattern may help with our understanding of other highly unusual characteristics attributed to personality in The Urantia Book—such as “changeless,” and “without identity.”</p>
<p>We Urantians have our unique personality bestowed upon us by the Universal Father prior to receipt of another unique gift from the Father, a pre-personal part of himself having divine personality that the book terms our “Thought Adjuster.” (194-3; 71-1; 1226-3)) Herein may lie a clue to at least a partial understanding of this mysterious concept of a personality having no identity of its own.</p>
<p>The “pattern” of the personality bestowed upon us is capable of being expressed in many ways but in only one way that will become “perfection.” A task of the Thought Adjuster is to aid us to achieve that perfection while, at the same time, leaving intact the free will our personality confers upon us. “The survival of identity is dependent on the survival of the immortal soul of morontia status and increasingly divine value. Personality identity survives in and by the survival of the soul.” (195-6) The “identity” belongs to the living system that will be reconstituted on the mansion worlds, not to the personality. The role of the personality is to unify that living system. (1225-2; 9-1)</p>
<p>There are far too many statements relating to “personality” for us to be able to explore all of them. A selection follows that ranges over the whole of the first three parts of the book. The profound concept of “personality,” as developed in The Urantia Book, is quite different from the customary loose usage of the word. It appears on more than 1000 occasions in the book, 86 percent being found in Parts 1-3.</p>
<p>The abbreviated quotations given below may shed some light on the importance and meaning of the book’s “personality” concept while, at the same time, illustrating the remarkable consistency of its usage—despite the fact that many individual authors were involved in the writing of the Urantia Papers.</p>
<p>Personality is bestowed by the Universal Father himself or by the Conjoint Actor, acting for the Father.(1225-3)
Personality (of mortal man) is neither body, mind, spirit; nor the soul. (9-1)
Personality is bestowed upon the living and associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit, and survives with the survival of the morontial soul. (9-1)
Personality is integrating and supervising. (1134-3)
Personality is changeless in an otherwise ever-changing creature experience. (9-1)
Personality (human) and the Adjuster personality are changeless; the relationship between them (in the soul) is nothing but change. (1226-3)
Personality is basically changeless; that which changes is the moral character. (1572-7)
Personality unifies all other associated factors of individuality. (9-1)
Personality, while devoid of identity, can unify the identity of any living energy system. (1225-2)
Personality or identity forms are patterns resultant from energy (physical, spiritual, or mindal) but are not inherent therein. (10-4)
Personality: Paradise Sons of the order of Michael are perfect personalities, even the pattern for all local universe personality. (28-3)
Personality:  The relative free will which characterizes the self-consciousness of human personality is involved in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moral decision, highest wisdom.</li>
<li>Spiritual choice, truth discernment.</li>
<li>Unselfish love, brotherhood service.</li>
<li>Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty.</li>
<li>Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meaning.</li>
<li>Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion
to doing the Father’s will.</li>
<li>Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values
and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-
Giver. (194-7)</li>
</ol>
<p>Personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting phenomena—self-consciousness and associated relative free will. (1225-5)
Personality imparts unique prerogatives of choice to the living system. (1301-4)
Personality: Morality, virtue is indigenous to human personality. (192:8)
Personality is characterized by morality—awareness of relativity of relationship with other persons. (1225-11)
Personality discerns conduct levels and choosingly discriminates between them. (1225-11)
Personality is unique, absolutely unique. (1225-10)
Personality responds directly to other-personality presence. (1226-11)
Personality: capacity for divine personality is inherent in the prepersonal Adjuster. (71-1)
Personality: capacity for human personality is potential in the cosmic-mind endowment of the human being. (71-1)
Personality bestowal enables a mortal creature to become reactive to the constitutive recognition of the three basic mind realities of the cosmos:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mathematical or logical recognition of the
uniformity of physical causation.</li>
<li>The reasoned recognition of the obligation of
moral conduct.</li>
<li>The faith-grasp of the fellowship worship of
Deity, associated with the loving service of
humanity. (195-1)
Personality bestowal confers the dignity of cosmic citizenship. (195-3)
Personality: the experiential personality of man is not observable as a functional reality until the material life vehicle has been touched by the divinity of the Universal Father. (71-1)
Personality causes spirit to strive for the mastery of energy-matter through the mediation of mind. (1225-6)
Personality is independent of, and antecedent to, the bestowal of the Thought Adjuster. (194-3)
Personality, in the supreme sense, is the revelation of God to the universe of the universes. (29-3)
Personality identifies man as a spiritual being. (1228-4)
Personality is uniquely conscious of time, and this is something other than the time perception of mind or spirit. (1225-2)
These few quotations present only a very limited portion of material in The Urantia Book relevant to  “personality,” but should be sufficient to demonstrate that the book is a work of intense and dedicated scholarship, not the dreamtime meanderings of a sleeping mind as proposed by Martin Gardner nor a slap dash book that Gardner claimed could have been written over a couple of weekends by one such as Dr W.S. Sadler.</li>
</ol>
<p>A more in-depth study could include other related concepts such as “power-personality” that lead into consideration of the role of personality in the unification of God the Supreme and the Almighty Supreme in the Supreme Being.</p>
