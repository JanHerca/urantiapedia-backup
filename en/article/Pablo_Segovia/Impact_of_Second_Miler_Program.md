You can read about _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship's “Second Miler Grant Program” in this issue of the Mighty Messenger. It is with great enthusiasm that we share with you the recipients' projects.

We will be highlighting two projects per month in our NewsBlog ([urantiabook.org/fellowship-news](https://urantiabook.org/fellowship-news)) and in our publications.

If you would like more information about the Second Miler Grant Program and the application please go to [urantiabook.org/About-The-Urantia-Book-Fellowship#second-miler](https://urantiabook.org/About-The-Urantia-Book-Fellowship#second-miler).

The project we are highlighting in this issue was submitted by Pablo Morales in support of a team of six Urantia Book readers and teachers in Venezuela who have been developing materials for and facilitating faceto-face meetings. Their focus has been to have regular, two-hour meetings for deep discussion with readers and regular two-hour meetings to help new readers with their initial questions and doubts about _The Urantia Book_. Some of their activities have been transmitted on urantia.tv. They long to bring their meetings into the virtual world.

LECTURA INTERACTIVA (INTERACTIVE READING) is an ongoing project since October, 2020 where the more difficult parts of the book are read and discussed.

PRIMERAS MIRADAS A URANTIA (FIRST LOOK AT URANTIA) is an ongoing project since August, 2020 that focuses on those who have not finished their first Urantia Book reading as well as very new readers.

PROFUNDIZACIÓN Y DISCERNIMIENTO (DEEPING AN DDISCER NING) is an ongoing project since August, 2020 that focuses on those who have read the book at least once.

The team working on this project has a lot of experience with the book, with some finding the book as early as 1995. Many of them have their own social media pages and make their own YouTube videos to promote the teachings. The images shown are from their videos. You can learn more details about this dedicated team, find their social media pages, and follow their progress at our website, [urantiabook.org/Second-Miler-Pablo-Morales/](https://urantiabook.org/Second-Miler-Pablo-Morales/).

“During the almost 43 years that I have been searching and sharing Universal Truth, and the Spirit of God, nothing (of what my senses have captured) has produced more positive stimulus and a favorable change of life, as the content of _The Urantia Book_, especially the Life and Teachings of Jesus.”

“_The Urantia Book_ has changed my life, leading me to share its teaching with all my siblings through the development of videos and secondary material regarding the Fifth Epochal Revelation.”

This amazing group is attempting to upgrade their equipment so they can continue these meetings in the virtual world. _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship is helping with the purchase of some of the equipment they need. As of March 10 , they have ordered their equipment from the United States and are awaiting its arrival.
