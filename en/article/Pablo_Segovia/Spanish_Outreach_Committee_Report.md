After our March meeting this year, Jack Halloway and I started working with the help of Cristina Seaborn to create a small survey that would help us identify the potential leaders of South America and Spain, and see what their immediate needs were in terms of resources to communicate with readers of the book.

By the time we decided to close the survey we had just over 50 people who had answered it out of a total of 500 emails sent. This is a similar proportion obtained in the survey in English that David Schlundt conducted.

Of the total responses, 25 readers considered that they were interested in creating an online study group.

Another of our objectives was to know how feasible our idea was to provide one or more zoom accounts for groups in Latin America. Several responded positively and appreciated the initiative. Today we have Pablo Morales from Venezuela who administers three study groups on different days and times every week, and Nelida Oliver who administers a study group on Fridays.

The acquisition of the zoom account for Latin America we believe is an extremely positive action that will provide a great service in the future.

From this same zoom account, the international conference in Mexico will be held on August 21st 2020.

There were many more people interested in our zoom account, unfortunately many of them decided to get their own just before we launched our project. COVID 19 has created this need.

We are convinced that in the future more people will benefit from this resource. We sent individualized emails to all the leaders who decided to contact us. Many of them responded with joy knowing that we were beginning to take action in relation to this matter.

At the end of this process, Agustin Arellano, who has worked for more than 20 years with all of them, organized a meeting with more than 30 leaders from 20 countries in Latin America to introduce the leaders of the Urantia Book Fellowship, particularly to the International Committee. This meeting was attended by André Radatus, Geoff Theiss and myself.

We consider the meeting to be a success, since we feel that this may be the beginning of a fruitful relationship in which our capacities can express their true potential. Among the objectives of the meeting was to give them the opportunity to inform us of their plans for the dissemination of the revelation.

This week we have received four proposals that we will analyze and see if we can somehow help them with the budget that we have for this year. The budget could not be used for the different face-to-face conferences around the world.

The need of many other leaders in the meeting was books. Since last month we have been working to coordinate the delivery of these requests. We started sending 20 books to Argentina to a group led by Mario Ferreira with about 40 members.

The next request we are working on is for Venezuela, where Pablo Morales, a dedicated leader of our community, will be in charge of distributing books to the neediest readers. All this is being made possible thanks to the help and excellent disposition of our dear sister Paula Thompson and Pipeline of Light.

Before the meeting, the possibility that some leaders were interested in creating societies that were linked to the Fellowship was mentioned, and we offered to cooperate with them so they could achieve their objectives.

It is my personal opinion that we have a bright and extremely fruitful future in our relations with the leaders of Latin America. I feel that the ideas of these enthusiastic readers can create a critical mass that encourages the effervescence that we need so much.
