Dear Brothers and Sisters,

It has been a very interesting year for me. Since I have had the opportunity to be part of the General Council, I have been entrusted with the task of correcting and improving the old Urantia Book Fellowship Spanish website. In conjunction with my good friend Jack Holloway, this task was an honor to carry out, with the help of our sister Andrea Barnes.

In addition to Andrea Barnes, I have come to know incredible personalities along the way. With the migration to the new website just around the corner, we volunteered to help in this process. Since our knowledge in this area was--and continues to be--limited, I requested my wife Andrea (who knows a lot more than I do) to help me. She was more than happy to be part of this beautiful mission. In collaboration with Richard Daunt, Jena Lassiter, Emilio Coppola and others, we learned how to manage the completion of the migration of the Spanish website. We did this in less time than we planned to invest, which was great!

Today, feeling more peaceful, we are looking for the best way to promote the website and create new tools that provide some service to visitors. We are also working on taking advantage of this wonderful gift from Google, the Google AdWords grant to the Urantia Book Fellowship.

Our goal for the website is to become an attractive and inspiring place for all readers of the Urantia Book, whether they are beginners or advanced in search of resources.

We see a bright future for our community and we have great expectations for the website. We want to see in our life time great progress in the direction of unity.

Pablo Segovia
