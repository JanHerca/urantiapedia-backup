Cristina Seaborn's tireless efforts in publications have always inspired me to serve more.

This issue of The Mighty Messenger is about our international outreach—specifically, Latin American, Uganda, and the Philippines

It has always been a pleasure to say yes to Cristina for magazine covers. T his time I felt like I should create art to honor each international region.

The originals are for sale and there is also a very limited edition series of prints.

For more information on their availability and the portion which Will be donated to the Fellowship you can visit my website:
