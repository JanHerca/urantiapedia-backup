The central uniqueness of the URANTIA Book orientation lies, in the last analysis, on its focus upon singular individual guidance by means of the indwelling Thought Adjuster. The everyday behavioral consequences of this “giant leap forward for mankind” are immediate and profound, ranging from here through eternity, and for every individual of will capacity regardless of any other qualifications. It is a revolutionary transformation in the meaning of the authentic personhood, and from it follows the promise of a new community.

No longer evaluated from the “Alpha position” of genetic origins, ethnic or national affiliation, or religious membership, each and every person is now visible from the revealed “Omega position”- the vantage point of each and every God fragment which is the infinite potential within each of us. Both accidents of birth and achievements of education are rendered relatively invisible from this astonishing Omega perspective which measures not our deficiencies of nature, morality, knowledge, or group association, but rather our eternal possibilities Godward. The older equalities and inequalities of naturalism, legalism, intellectualism, and chosen-peopleism crumble before this illumination now marching above the horizon of consciousness, altering the meaning scape wherever we look.

Striking step with this viewpoint of majestic respect for the individual, we begin to discover deep changes in attitude and far-ranging transformations in behavior. The responsibility for another's growth is immediately transferred from one's own ego efforts to the higher network of Thought Adjusters among us. Instantly we may even see that not everyone's Father fragment wants him to know _The URANTIA Book_! I am no longer pridefully my brother's keeper, but surely know he is kept by God even as I.

Herein eventuates a fresh level of community majestic individuals even in life's gutters related through the mutuality of their mighty Mystery Monitors. Spirituality elevates to Adjuster value-consciousness applied and re-applied to living. Sins of the spirit flash into perspective, the greatest now having to do not with the flesh or even society, but with the violation and frustration of Adjuster- to- Adjuster relations between and among us.

At last the supreme and loving patience of Jesus with his wayward children on all levels makes sense, for time itself is re-valued from the Omega perspective. Each of us as humans, no more, no les5, is equal on the highest level of being — through direct contact with God-internal, an internal fragment of the Father Himself. And that can only lead to the deepest, highest regard for the individual ever manifested on this planet Urantia.
