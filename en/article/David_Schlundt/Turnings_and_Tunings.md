_I was Looking over there_
_when the world ended..._
_hardly heard the earth expire._
_The ground had Geen shaking so long anyway,_
_drunk with oil and oligarchies._

_Yes, I was Looking over there_
_when it must have happened —_
_at mountain snow-fields highframed_
_through aspen sentine_
_punctuating deep blue Rocky sky-lines._

_Such an essay God wrought to my perspectius _
_that day the world ended!_

_Or was it the day the world began?_

_The turnings have been so long_
_the cusp so steep_
_I wasn't really looking_
_for the other side of death that day._
_Only when I touched tomorrow_
_did I find its texture_
_transformed_
_translucent_
_totalizing_
_tuned to a whole new age of transitions and_
_transformations._

_And so, now that the end of the beginning is past_
_I can tell it's tims to tune up_
_and tune in_
_to New turnings._

David Schlundt died in September, 1991.
