_By Gwen Wenzel, Brier, Washington_

While travelling from Washington to Mexico with my daughter, Leslie Alana and friend, Jo Thackwray, we visited many study groups and shared the joys of brother/sisterhood. Our final stop before leaving California was with a most beautiful and spiritual family - the Hunt's. On Sunday afternoon we gathered to share a wonderful worship technique I learned from friends in Canada.

20-20-20 is a spiritual exercise where we begin by sitting together in a circle for 20 minutes and centering on God — trying to comprehend him, sending him our love and becoming selfforgetting. At the first 20 minute signal we go directly into writing for the second 20 minutes, using the blank paper at hand to write anything that comes to us. During the final 20 minutes we share what has flowed through us and onto the paper.

As always, we were surprised at the truth, beauty and goodness that flowed forth from every- one present — elders, teens and our youngest member, Ciera Hunt, who is ten. We radiated pure love to the Most Highs and in turn we were graced by the Spirit of Truth who was present within our extended Family of God.

It is with much love and special permission that we publish the following poem written by Ciera Hunt during this unique and inspiring experience. Thanks Ciera!

## A Sprite's Guide To Self-Esteem

_By Giera Hunt (age 10)_

<p style="text-align:center;">
I am a sprite and I have good eyesight. <br>
I know wrong from right.<br>
I don't bite but sometimes you got to fight. <br>
Stand up for yourself <br>
or it might be too late.<br>
However sometimes you have to<br>
take the comment <br>
go fly a kite!<br>
Cause being a Sprite <br>
you have to go on a flight.<br>
<br>
Forget about the sorrow, forget about the time.<br>
Put time on hold and unfold<br>
Do what feels right, you really should.<br>
The spirits will help you <br>
the angels will sing.<br>
Show God you still have some zing <br>
at the end of the ring.<br>
Show God you still can be something <br>
you are a person, a true living thing.<br>
<br>
You have no time to spare.<br>
Live your life unusual and rare.<br>
Laugh at some trees, sing to your dog <br>
pig out like a hog.<br>
Stand up for yourself in a non-fighting way.<br>
Say hey, Matt, I don't like that. Walk away.<br>
Give yourself a pat on the back.<br>
You just showed God how to be pure.<br>
<br>
You play with your mind and <br>
sing to your toes<br>
and even occasionally pick your nose.<br>
You have a spirit I do recommend.<br>
Work up your self esteem.<br>
Look in the mirror<br>
and say Horray!<br>
Wow!<br>
Now!<br>
