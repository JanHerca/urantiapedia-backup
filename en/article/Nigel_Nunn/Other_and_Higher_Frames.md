> _Faith most willingly carries_ **_reason_** _along as far as reason can go and then goes on with_ **_wisdom_** _to the full philosophic limit; and then it dares to launch out upon the limitless and never-ending universe journey in the sole company of TRUTH._ <a id="a42_261"></a>[[UB 103:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_7)]

“Reason” has helped scientists to write some compelling tales about the history of the universe:  inflationary Big Bangs, colliding branes, a multiverse. Problem is, each of these histories involve assumptions that lie beyond our capacity to disprove. These stories do however all share one feature: an attempt to replace faith with facts in their assumptions.

Which is where they all bump into a wall. The facts within reach – like the redshifts and rotations of galaxies, like the quantized interaction of particles – are proving inadequate to explain what astronomers are beginning to observe. As our tools and techniques improve, assumptions which prop up our currently competing cosmologies have become increasingly strained – constrained by increasingly inconvenient facts. Thus “Wisdom” (and common sense) requires that we review those assumptions. But wisdom also is constrained, by the frames within which we think. Which is where _The Urantia Book_ comes in:

> _[…]. Man must think in a mortal universe frame, but that does not mean that he cannot envision other and higher frames within which thought can take place._ <a id="a53_160"></a>[[UB 115:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_2)]

“Other and higher frames…” At the very same time that Schrodinger & Dirac, Heisenberg & Pauli were wrestling with quantized mechanics, simultaneous with Lemaitre and Hubble attempting to map motion in the cosmos, _The Urantia Book_ was presented – a glimpse from “another and higher frame”. This glimpse includes insights tuned to shift our current standard models – of physics and cosmology – beyond the confusion in which they’re now stuck.

For those interested in such things, we now have a set of videos that walk us through this aspect of the fifth epochal revelation, showing how _The Urantia Book_ gently extends the best work of human science. For example, it explains why a Higgs-type mechanism works so well, how ultimatonic axions solve the strong CP problem, and the real reason why redshift is proportional to distance. And that’s just the appetizer!

You find the whole series of ‘Introduction to _The Urantia Book’_ on ANZURA’s website:

[https://anzura.urantia-association.org/2017/10/20/video-introduction-to-urantia-book/](https://anzura.urantia-association.org/2017/10/20/video-introduction-to-urantia-book/) – or

Here are links to the videos (on YouTube), plus their (PDF) scripts:

**Part 4A – Foundations (v2)** https://youtu.be/ZerrvI4dLTQ

**Part 4B1 – Mass and Matter** https://youtu.be/-ZurF1V81W8

**Part 4B2 – Mass and Matter** https://youtu.be/AE0uUliBfis

( [Script for Part 4B](http://ubron.org/groupdocs/P4_B_Mass_Matter1.pdf) )

**Part 4C – Exploding Dark Islands (v2)** https://youtu.be/q8nAUKE0-OM

( [Script for Part 4C](http://ubron.org/groupdocs/P4_C_2018_Apr15.pdf) )

The two links below are a draft script for the final video (Part 4D). This last part remains a work in progress, as I try to accommodate current developments in mainstream cosmology. Recording of this final video is expected to coincide with some surprising developments in astronomy!

[Part 4 D (ii) Issues](http://ubron.org/groupdocs/P4D_Issues_Nov01.pdf)

_**The Urantia Book**_ – a gift to those future souls who will dare to launch beyond where **reason** and **wisdom** can go!
