Membership of the Committee on Education for the year 1973-1974 consisted of the following:

- Kenton E. Stephens, Chairman
- Albert H. Dyon
- Marian T. Rowley
- Helen C. Carlson
- Lynn Kulieke
- E. L. Christensen

Since the organization of the Urantia Brotherhood, the Committee on Education has been responsible for two essential activities: first of all, the ongoing evening studies, centered in Chicago, which led to the certification of leaders and to the ordination of teachers; secondly, the summer study sessions.

 The evening studies at this time do not exist. There are several reasons for this. First of all, leadership in the persons of Dr. William Sadler and Mr. Alvin Kulieke is no longer with us. For many years, these evening studies depended upon the interest and stamina of these two men, as well as others who were part of the teaching process. Since the death of Alvin, who was also a member of the Education Committee and Dean of the school, the evening sessions disappeared. 

There is, however, some renewed interest in reaching out to people in the Chicago area and, perhaps, even on a larger scale in some way so that we may continue with the preparation of leaders. The Committee on Education has received a proposal to reinaugurate such studies and will consider the proposal shortly after this year’s summer study session. Miss Lynn Kulieke and Mr. Mark Kulieke, with others, have developed a set of ideas which will be the focus of our consideration. 

From time to time we have polled the Societies throughout the country and have found that they have become more self-sufficient in the development of study programs. Therefore, the loss in Chicago is not a complete one. 

As far as the summer study session is concerned, good growth and progress has been evident. For the first time, the session was held away from the 533 building. More people were involved as participants and as attendees. By the time this report is read to the General Assembly, we will have the exact figures on those who enjoyed the program at Kendall College in Evanston. Planning for an expanded summer study session, of course, has become more difficult. Not only were members of the committee directly involved with the planning, but Mr. Paul Snider, in his first year as President of the Brotherhood, took an active interest. We are very much interested in reactions to the summer study session and we will either rely on spontaneous communications or, perhaps, we will poll the Societies for reactions. 

My decision to relinquish my responsibilities as Chairman of the committee comes from a dilemma which has plagued me for years. There are serious conflicts between the time involved with the Education Committee and my work as Superintendent of Schools in Oak Park. Therefore, in order to make possible less restricted leadership, I have submitted my resignation to the President of the Brotherhood. The activities of the years were gratifying. I will lend whatever assistance I can to the newly elected leaders of the Committee. 

Kenton E. Stephens

Chairman, Committee on Education
