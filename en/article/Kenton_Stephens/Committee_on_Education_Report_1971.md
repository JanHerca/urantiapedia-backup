July 1971

The Committee on Education in its meetings since July 1970 undertook serious investigation of different and augmented ways of reaching Urantians who live at a distance from Chicago or who find it difficult to travel regularly to a society's meeting or to Urantia Brotherhood headquarters. In March 1971 society and study groups were surveyed concerning their interest in sending qualified individuals to Chicago “for one or more seminars of two to three days of intensive instruction. ” (See attached copy of March 8 letter.) The results were surprising, to say the least. The level of interest among the societies and groups was nowhere high enough for the committee to recommend establishing such seminars. Aside from the usual problems of cost, transportation, and time, there was a strong hint in the replies that the societies and groups wanted to rely heavily on their own individual styles of study and contemplation.

Headquarters seemed to be a little too much “establishment”, at least for some of the respondents. The replies could be useful for some study by the Executive Committee. Nevertheless, the task of re-examining the purposes and procedures of the school continues. Members of the committee have suggested revisions in the present curriculum, which constitute the basis for further discussion in the committee.

The committee and the school continued operation of the week-night study sessions at 533 Diversey in the same pattern now in effect for several years. It is expected that these sessions will continue.

In addition, the school was responsible for planning the 1971 summer study session (a copy of the program is enclosed). These sessions were initiated in 1963 and occur in those years when the Triennial Delegate Assembly does not meet. Dates for 1971 are Friday, July 30, and Saturday, July 31.

It is the personal, subjective opinion of the chairman that the function of the school in formally preparing teachers and leaders must be re-examined in the light of new enterprises undertaken by societies and study groups. They have thrived without sustained supervision from headquarters. The press toward decentralization is strong in all segments of Western society and the Urantia Brotherhood is no more immune than our educational systems.

The membership of the committee is a matter of record. The council should note that the committee created the school with the following officers:

President Kenton E. Stephens Dean Alvin S. Kulieke Registrar Helen Carlson

Respectfully submitted, Kenton E. Stephens, Chairman
