July, 1973

Until the death of Alvin Kulieke, the Committee on Education had the following members:

- Kenton E. Stephens, Chairman
- Albert H. Dyon
- Marian T. Rowley
- Helen C. Carlson
- Alvin L. Kulieke
- E. L. Christensen

Lynn Kulieke has replaced Alvin Kulieke as a member of the committee.

This report covers the time from the meeting of the last Triennial Delegate Assembly in July 1970 to this date. It was a period of considerable thought and review of the purposes and functions of the committee. A serious investigation of different and augmented ways of reaching Urantians who live at a distance from Chicago and who find it difficult to travel regularly, was undertaken. In March, 1971, societies and study groups were surveyed concerning their interest in sending qualified individuals to Chicago “for one or more seminars of two to three days of intensive instruction.” (See attached copy of March 8, 1971 lett.) The results were surprising, to say the least. The level of interest among the societies and groups was nowhere near high enough for the committee to recvommed establishing such seminars. Aside from the usual problems of cost, transportation, and time, there was a strong hint in the replies that the socieities and groups wanted to rely heavily on their own individual styles of study and contemplation.

Headquarters seemed to be alittle too much “establishment,” at leazst for some of the respondents. The task of reeexamining the purposes and proc4dures of the school and the other work of the committee continuews.

Up until the dealth of Alvin Kulieke, the committee and the school continued operation of the week-night study sessions at 5 33 Diversey Parkway in the same pattern which had existed over a period of several years. Alvin Kulieke had been the mainstay of these sessions and Urantians, at least in the Chicago area, will long remember him for the work and the insight which he brought to his task.
