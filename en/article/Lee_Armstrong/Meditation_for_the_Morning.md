Lee Armstrong
Greenville, North Carolina, U.S.A.

Good morning my loving Spirit Guide. I pray this morning in your Light for increased communication with my Indwelling Spirit. It is my will to further cooperate with my Adjuster who creates the transcript of my soul. I pray for the enlargement and growth of my soul today, if only by a little. Help me to think of the Father first when faced with a decision. Help me to remember Michael first when faced with the animal reactions of my human nature. Help me to nurture the Spirit in all those who are in my path today. It is my will, Father, that your will be done.
