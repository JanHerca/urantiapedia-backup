The Creation story in [Genesis 1:26](/en/Bible/Genesis/1#v26) says, “Let us make man in our image and likeness...” We are created in the image of God. Our roots of being are grounded in Ultimate Reality. This, admittedly, is an astounding and challenging statement. What does it mean? It means there is far more to you than meets the eye, and far more in store for you as you journey through this life and beyond than you can possibly fathom in your wildest and most hopeful dreams. Isn't such a thought exciting and intriguing! Well, it's true, and in this series I am going to invite you on a journey with me, as together we explore how we might grow personally and as a community in spiritual stature and vision.

## We Have Enormous Potential

I have often been intrigued by something Wordsworth once said: we should build up the beings that we are. You and I have enormous potential to grow. We have latent possibilities that can only be realized as we faith venture in commitment and bear the fruits of service. To us much has been given and from us much is required.We must give ourselves wholeheartedly to something larger than ourselves. In this way we develop our highest good, benefit our fellows, and glorify God.

We should remember that we are not marionettes on a string. We have the power to take charge over most of the circumstances in our lives, and the capacity to shape our attitudes toward those things we cannot change. So let us resolve to take responsibility for our lives, and to evolve the essence of our being with which God has endowed us.

## Do You Know Who You Are?

There is a goofy story about a man who went to his doctor complaining about terrible neck pains, throbbing headaches, and recurring dizzy spells. The doctor examined him and said, “I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. You have only six months to live.” The doomed man decided he would spend his remaining time on earth enjoying himself. He quit his job, bought a sports car, and a closet full of new suits and shoes.

Then he went to get himself a dozen tailored shirts. He went to the finest shirt shop he could find. The tailor measured him and wrote down among other measurements, “size 16 neck.” “Wait a moment,” the man interrupted, “I always wear size 14 neck, and that is what I want.” “I'd be glad to do it for you sir,” the tailor replied, “however, if you wear shirt size 14 neck, I can guarantee you that you're going to have terrible neck pains, throbbing headaches, and recurring dizzy spells.”

In a sense, this humorous story speaks effectively to the points that I wish to make in order for us to be able to grow in personal spiritual stature. First of all, we need to know who we are-what are our personal challenges? What are our strengths? What are our real needs? What is our sense of calling? I am convinced that many, if not most of us, are not very well acquainted with our authentic selves. I invite you to examine your inner life. Reflect on what you need to bring your highest fulfillment. Then courageously admit what your shortcomings are that stand in the way of your creative self-realization.

## Our Lives Are Shaped by Our Courageous Searching

In Matthew's gospel ([7:7](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v7)) Jesus says, “Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened." Ask for God's help and strength. Search and examine your life in faith; lose your life in God's purposes and you will really find it. Invest your life under God's direction and your life will increase abundantly. Spiritual growth, progress in the mastery of personal destiny, comes from a deep yearning to know God and be like God. It is a hungering for truth, beauty, and goodness to be a part of your life.

In order to achieve objective self-awareness, we must cultivate a spirit of humility. John Brodie, one time quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, was once asked why a superstar like himself should have to hold the ball for field goals and points after touch down. “Well,” said Brodie, “if I didn't, the ball would fall over.” No arrogance, no obnoxious pretense. He understood his place and service in the greater scheme of things.

Cultivating a spirit of humility is not easy, and often we misunderstand what it means to be humble. To be humble in spirit means to honestly assess and admit our limitations, needs, and shortcomings. It is not an attitude of inferiority or inadequacy. In our realistic appraisal, we should be overwhelmed by an increasing awareness of just how much God loves us and can accomplish with our lives in spite of our limitations.

The flip side of humility is self-righteousness. Self-righteousness says that I have no need of God — not thy will be done, but my will be done. Those who think they have it all together, who are not aware of their need for spiritual growth, are the Pharisees of society most in need of spiritual awakening. It is only when we are honest and open that we can grow personally and as a community of faith.

## Our Past Need Not Control Our Future

Norman Vincent Peale tells of spending some time on a lush tropical isle of Jamaica. In the hotel where they were staying there was a map that hung in one of the hallways. In a corner of the map there was some very faint lettering over an almost uninhabited part of the island. Looking closely, Dr. Peale made out the words, “The Land of look behind.” Intrigued, he asked the owner of the hotel what those words meant. The hotel owner said that in the days of slavery, runaways from the sugar plantation as they entered this wilderness were constantly looking over their shoulders in fear to see who was coming after them.

All too often many of us live in the land of look behind. We still live in a time of past mistakes, regrets, and painful experiences. And that looking back keeps us from looking ahead with confidence, of growing spiritually into the future. There is a tremendous relief in being able to admit our mistakes, our shortcomings, and our needs. It is refreshing to face reality, to be genuine, for this is the foundation for spiritual growth. Trusting in God's forgiveness of our past errors, we are free to forgive ourselves and face the future with fresh vision. We should realize that to acknowledge the areas in which we need to grow isn't a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength. It is character producing. Taking responsibility for our lives is among the first and most important steps to personal growth and fulfillment.

## God's Love is Your Limitless Resource

Some of us might be afraid, in our heart of hearts, that our shortcomings, the mistakes we have made in our life, are just too great for even God to bear — that God has turned his back on us. Let me categorically assure you, that is not true. God's love has no limits with his children who desire to grow spiritually. The good news of great joy which lies at the very heart of the gospel is that salvation and personal fulfillment is open to all who wish to grow in God's loving care. God patiently whispers to our souls that we are loved in ways that we have never known before. Even though we may close ourselves off from God's love, God continues to indwell our minds and knock on the door of our hearts.

Trust God, open your mind and soul to his leading. God will never forsake you and leave you desolate. God will care for you tenderly — and love you, and love you, and love you until you blossom and flourish from the experience of that love. Look at yourself and your needs, your shortcomings, and your potentials with courage. God's limitless resources are yours for the seeking. “Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find;” knock, and the door to the abundant life will be opened to you.

Please know that God holds you tenderly in his hand and will lead you into a spiritual career/adventure through the mansions of eternity. Praise be to God!
