In attempting to gain insight into the future of URANTIA Societies I think it's a good idea to go back to the origins of religious groups and examine some of their early functions.

We do not live in an isolated time in which our evolutionary path flies straight as an arrow to perfection. No, we are a product of the past and, in many ways, doing the things that people have done for age upon age. Sometimes our motives are more enlightened and sometimes they aren't.

Let us then examine some of the information we have at our disposal and while doing so try to consider how some of these ways of thinking and reacting correlate with some of our actions and feelings within the realm of Urantia Societies.

_The URANTIA Book_ relates some of the reasons for the formation, by primitive man, of secret societies. They were established " , , to practice minority religious rites... for the purpose of preserving valuable 'spirit' or trade secrets..." as well as “_... for the enjoyment of some special charm or magic. The very secrecy of these societies conferred on all members the power of mystery over the rest of the tribe, Secrecy also appeals to vanity: the initiates were the social aristocracy of their day._” (<a id="a39_510"></a>[UB 70:7.6-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_6))

Vanity, associated with pride, ambition, and honor, has always been a powerful force in the formation of human associations in that “_... such emotions are futile without an audience to parade before._” (<a id="a41_204"></a>[UB 68:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_10))

We learn that in the gradual progression of humanity's religious ideas, “_words eventually became fetishes, more especially those which were regarded as God's words; in this way the sacred books of many religions have become fetishistic prisons incarcerating the spiritual imagination of man._” (<a id="a43_296"></a>[UB 88:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p2_6)) It is plain that we have yet to consolidate the hard won gains of our forebears and that the seeds of regression are ever present.

### Promote Study

URANTIA Societies of the future must diligently promote study of the book. Continued exposure to genuine truth and lasting wisdom will help safeguard the idealistic purposes for which societies are founded.

We have a responsibility also to assure that each member achieves a thorough reading of the book. It is possible to elect to standing committees, to the executive committee, to the general council, and to positions as officers of the Urantia Brotherhood, persons who have not read the book. We must provide some mechanism to insure that each person accepting higher functional responsibility has read the book to the end that we maintain leadership based on the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_.

We can find in _The URANTIA Book_ numerous clues and guidelines for the wise development of URANTIA Societies. On page 966, we find that “Regardless of the drawbacks and handicaps, every new revelation of truth has given rise to a new cult.” And that “_... it is regrettable that so many modern believers... have no... cult of mutual support — nothing to belong to._” (<a id="a51_369"></a>[UB 87:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_3)) This is not a trivial point. A successful cult makes a great contribution to society. The author states that when the cult has been elastic and adjustable, then truth and social progression have grown rapidly. (<a id="a51_623"></a>[UB 87:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_5))

URANTIA Societies have the opportunity to provide the nucleus of the most inspiring, most progressive, most idealistic cult in the long history of this weary planet, Or, if we don't watch ourselves, our efforts can become a massive “_... obstacle to social reconstruction and spiritual progress,_” like so many cults of old. (<a id="a53_326"></a>[UB 87:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_2))

We must be aware constantly of unconscious and unplanned trends in our collective attitudes and activities, The things we never really stop to examine because they seem harmless or because they've always been that way are the things which will take form by themselves, be- come crystallized, and lead us to stagnation. “_Formal religion restrains men in their personal spiritual activities instead of releasing them for heightened service as kingdom builders._” (<a id="a55_463"></a>[UB 99:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_4)) The planning we do must take counsel with wisdom. We must be careful and at the same time avoid enervating stalemate disguised as caution.

### Avoid Cramping Intellectualism

Further guidance from the book tells us that “_The old cults were too egocentric._” (<a id="a59_85"></a>[UB 87:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_7)) They focused too much on themselves and neglected the real needs of their participants and of the world around them. We, too, can bury our faces between blue covers and neglect the suffering soul in our midst and the timid ones outside our doors. Yes, we must study _The URANTIA Book_ but we must use this study as a springboard to higher collective achievements and avoid the pitfalls of cramping intellectualism. We can prepare _ourselves_ 'til kingdom come and never see that amorphous day when URANTIA Societies are ready to turn their efforts to the world around them. URANTIA Societies will have to begin turning some of their group effort from egocentric activity to the applied love from which we're told the new cult must emerge.

There is more here from which we can learn. “_No cult can endure and contribute to the progress of social civilization and individual spiritual attainment unless it is based on the biologic, sociologic, and religious significance of the home._” (<a id="a61_246"></a>[UB 87:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_8)) That's strong language. The call for the commitment is crystal clear. No cult can endure and contribute unless it is based on the home.

Webster tells us that a base is “the fundamental part of something, the groundwork, the point from which a start is made in an action or undertaking, the bottom of something considered as its main support.” _The URANTIA Book_ devotes so much attention to the importance of the home that it can't be emphasized enough. In the future, URANTIA Societies must maintain vigilance in their recognition of this reality. When it becomes difficult for the family to feel a part of any society then that society will stagnate. When the home becomes separated from the activities of the society then will the society fail in its ultimate task.

If we are to move forward, if we are to evolve in meaningful ways, then we must heed these warnings as though they are guiding lights on a darkened shore. “_Family life,_” we're told, “_next to personal religious experience, suffers most from the decadence consequent upon the transition from old religious loyalties to the emerging new meanings and values._” (<a id="a65_361"></a>[UB 99:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_2))

### Encourage Worship

On <a id="a69_3"></a>[UB 99:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_2) we find further clues guiding our steps into the future. Here we are told “_It is the purpose of group religious activities..._” and there follows a list of eight functions. The last of these, almost emphasized by its concluding placement, is “_...to encourage group worship._” (<a id="a69_324"></a>[UB 99:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_2)) One of the purposes of group religious activities is to encourage group worship. Let's refresh our understanding of the importance of prayer and worship to the individual. I add prayer because in human experience prayer and worship are like bread and butter, or boys and girls. They always find a way to get together.

We know that “_...the truest prayer is in reality a communion between man and his Maker._” (<a id="a71_92"></a>[UB 91:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_3)) It is the surest and quickest way of approaching superconscious levels. (<a id="a71_208"></a>[UB 91:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_4)) We know that prayer is answered by a greater revelation of truth (<a id="a71_317"></a>[UB 91:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_11)) and that “_The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor..._” (<a id="a71_472"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34))

The crucial role of worship, in concert with the highest forms of prayer, is undeniable in man's quest for higher levels of reality. With such potency assured, how can group participation make any difference? is it merely for social suggestibility, the reinforcement of good intentions? I think not. There is a more compelling imperative. Witness the following.

“_Living associations, human families [to] ... the Paradise Trinity are not augmented by mere arithmetical summation. The group potential is always far in excess of the simple sum of the attributes of the component individuals._” (<a id="a75_231"></a>[UB 10:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_2)) Not only is communion a vital force for real growth, but a group increases its effective power substantially. Spiritual ascent without the benefit of group worship is like harvesting grain with a sickle and leaving the combine parked in the barn. “_The new cult ... must facilitate spiritual progress..._” (<a id="a75_581"></a>[UB 87:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_7))

The future of URANTIA Societies is related to what we do today just as the things we do today are related to the actions of our ancestors. We can learn from the past, take thoughtful action, follow the guidance of _The URANTIA Book_, and continue to evolve. There are decisions waiting to be made, decisions that require courage and strength.

We can take satisfaction with the status quo or we can take action with the tools at hand to build toward the future. We can become entrenched in expecting one another to toe the line or we can encourage one another in the leap of faith required to become spirit motivated leaders in a world grasping for direction. We can take the road of orthodoxy and convention or we can pioneer in the realm of collective religious attainment.
