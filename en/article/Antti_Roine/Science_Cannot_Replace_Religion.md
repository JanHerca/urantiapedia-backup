Science finds out how nature operates and then gives names to the new issues and phenomena. It specifies the new natural laws through experimental work and using chains of evidence. The earlier proven issues and methods are always used as the primary evidence for new ones, because effects cannot exist without causes. If we have the courage to pursue this chain of evidence to the end and meet the original cause, then we will always end up with God, i.e. we will find the primary reason which has no cause. Atheists try to wriggle out from this logical problem by inventing some name for this primary reason, such as the Big Bang.

All matter, energy, life, and spirit was compressed into a smaller space than a pin head fourteen billion years ago, according to the current official scientific conception. Scientific facts may, however, change because we still know less than one percent of the existing natural laws and issues. Science changes and improves our understanding of the universe all the time; however, we will always find God at the final end of every scientific footpath, now and forever.

Beauty, wisdom, justice, love, and faith cannot be measured with a gauge nor with any physical or chemical instrument. They do not react with matter or energy, but they still are as real as granite rock, because the human spirit makes them visible. Consequently, we are pure spiritual beings who have been temporarily locked into our bodies. We may notice this spirit when we meeti our friend's eyes and listen to his opinions; it is not the voice of the material.

## What is right and what is wrong?

Science does not speak out about the questions which have fundamental importance for the human spirit, what is right and what is wrong. Religion finds the answers to these questions. Real science bravely finds out those material issues which are true or false. Using science we may improve the welfare of our bodies. Real religion finds out those spiritual issues which are true and which make our brothers' and sisters' soul happy. These positive effects may be used to identify true science and true religion from the false and the fake. Real science and religion support each other.

Our life and world has exactly and accurately been designed just like this, so that we can make a free choice between faith and atheism. We could not make this free choice if we could prove the existence of God or some higher force using some scientific procedure.

Atheism and skepticism need much more blind faith than faith in Jesus, because science cannot prove that God does not exist. A Lutheran, Moslem or Jew, can be absolutely sure of God because they do not base their faith on scientific evidence but instead on God's Adjuster which lives in our minds. This tiny fraction of God makes our survival possible and wakes up our religious awareness.

## We Need Courage

We need courage to find the scientific or religious truth. The truth is difficult to find if we do not have the courage to study and explore all the information sources, taboos, and even sources which have been branded as suspicious. The truth does not depend at all on the information source, author, or ism; it is based only on verified scientific and spiritual facts. We should also listen to the voice of our own sense and conscience, which is the main reason we have them.

We may find a lot of truth, for example, from the Koran, Bible, and also from _The Urantia Book_, which gives a logical explanation of why we are here, where we come from, and where we are going. Our world and language are changing all the time; we do not need to stick with thousand-year-old interpretations in science and religion. We have enough old rituals, holy icons, and empty phrases. Instead, we deserve dynamic and living science, faith, and religion which really affect our daily life.

Two thousand years ago cowards shouted "Free Barabbas" and "Crucify Jesus." Many of us may imagine that this does not affect us; however, at the moment of departure each of us will face this very same personal selection.
