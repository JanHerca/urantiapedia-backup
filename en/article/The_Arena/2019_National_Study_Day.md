This year’s National Study Day, where you can participate in a study group in your local area and read the same paper on the same day as other readers, will be held on **Saturday 1 June, 2019.**  We’ll be studying **Paper** **9: _Relation of the Infinite Spirit to the Universe._**

<br style="clear:both;"/>

> _The Infinite Spirit, the Conjoint Creator, is a universal and divine minister. The Spirit unceasingly ministers the_ _Son’s mercy and the Father’s love, even in harmony with the stable, unvarying, and righteous justice of the Paradise Trinity. His influence and personalities are ever near you; they really know and truly understand you._ <a id="a46_342"></a>[[UB 9:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p0_3)]

We have once again invited the international readership to join us so that we may be united in Spirit with students of _The Urantia Book_ across the entire globe.
