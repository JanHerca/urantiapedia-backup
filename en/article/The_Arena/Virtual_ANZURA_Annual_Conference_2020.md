## Post COVID Spiritual Life

Long ago in 2018 when we first started to plan this conference, we picked a theme based on 2020 representing perfect vision, and were looking forward to exploring the hindsight, insight and foresight offered by _The Urantia Book_. Sadly, we were not given the foresight to predict COVID, and we live in a much-altered world now.

Along with changes in our lives around work, travel, and socialisation, how we live our spiritual lives will necessarily also be affected to a greater or lesser degree. The most obvious change is the online format of this conference, which hopefully will still allow us to share our spiritual perspectives, and to enjoy the virtual fellowship of like-minded souls.

The format of this conference will also be slightly different, in that there can only ever be one person talking at a time, which certainly is not the case in face to face events.

The presenters will explore different aspects of spiritual and practical life after COVID, from lessons we can learn from this experience, to the need to communicate sensitively with others, and the challenge to Truth in our online world, as well as a look at some interesting study aids and the new ANZURA website. We hope to see many of you online Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> October as we explore this different way of gathering together.

Another reminder along with the Zoom link to this conference will be sent closer to the actual conference time.

Regards,
NZ Conference Committee
