## Talkin’ Bout a Revelation

We invite you to join us at the 2023 ANZURA Annual Conference that will be held **25 to 28 August** at the delightful Peter Canisius House in Pymble on Sydney’s leafy North Shore.

## About the Conference Theme

How are we talking about the concepts of _The Urantia Book_ with non-readers and new readers? How can we discuss such universal truths that everyone needs to know without alienating them? How can we convince increasingly secular, sceptical and materially focused people that the spiritual world is just as real? How can we help to transform stagnant traditional religious practice into courageous living and dynamic spiritual growth?

We have in our hands an updated version of revelations presented to our ancestors that over time have become unclear and unappealing to many in our modern world. It is a very big book that requires years of invested time and effort for most of us to even glimpse an understanding. But when we do understand, we realise that we know what the world needs most to hear to help meet present day challenges and improve the lives of everyone on this planet. The book is now widely available in many forms to anyone who may be seeking, thanks to the endeavours of many over the years. But people either aren’t looking for it, don’t know it exists or think they don’t have the time required to read it. How can we, seasoned readers, best demonstrate and discuss what we have learned in ways that attract others to the book and its teachings, and that doesn’t do harm to our message? How can we better identify fertile ground: those who may be seeking and receptive to the seeds of truth we have to offer them? What might be their objections and criticisms and how should we best overcome them?

At this year’s ANZURA conference we hope to tap into and share that huge reservoir of knowledge, understanding and talent that exists within the readership community. Please join us as we workshop the core fundamentals of the books teachings and develop some practical tools and attractive ways of talking about this planet-saving revelation with the people we meet in our everyday lives.

> “No man, when he lights a lamp, covers it up with a vessel or puts it under the bed; he puts his lamp on a stand where all can behold the light. Let me tell you that nothing is hid in the kingdom of heaven which shall not be made manifest; neither are there any secrets which shall not ultimately be made known. Eventually, all these things shall come to light.” <a id="a56_365"></a>[UB 151:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_1)

> “You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me.” <a id="a58_426"></a>[UB 176:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_5) 

> “Freely have you received; therefore freely should you give of the truth of heaven, and in the giving will this truth multiply and show forth the increasing light of saving grace, even as you minister it.” <a id="a60_208"></a>[UB 176:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_10)

> The act is ours, the consequences God’s. <a id="a62_43"></a>[UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13)

Their vision is to “Provide outstanding hospitality to our guests to share and experience a spirit of quiet and a sacred place to engage in spiritual conversations.”
