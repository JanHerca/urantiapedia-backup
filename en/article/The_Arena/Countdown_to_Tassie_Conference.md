## 21 – 24 October 2022

**Registration is now open!** (see below for details)

Time is running out to register for this year’s Annual Conference being held in Port Arthur, Tasmania 21 to 24 October. Treat yourselves to this special event by dusting off those unused travel bags and making the trek. If you haven’t made up your mind yet about coming, there’s still time to book, but to secure the accommodation we need to know by the middle of August so please hurry so we can finalise our booking with the venue.

After two years of virtual conferences, we are excited about meeting up with everyone again face-to-face. There’s no substitute for in-person contact while discussing in-depth our favourite book!

Stewarts Bay Lodge is set in a stunning waterfront location and is nestled in a world heritage listed national park. It’s in walking distance to Port Arthur’s Historic Site and offers a variety of quality self-contained cabin and chalet accommodation with restaurant, function rooms and recreation facilities all surrounded by a white-sand beach, crystal clear ocean waters and beautiful woodlands.

## Theme: Walking the ROPE – An Invitation to Intimacy with God

The ‘ROPE’ in the theme title is an acronym for the **R**eligion **O**f **P**ersonal **E**xperience so the full meaning of the theme title translates to ‘Walking the Religion of Personal Experience – An Invitation to Intimacy with God’. We hope that this will be a truly enriching spiritual experience for all who attend, either in person or via Zoom. We will be talking about the _ultimate human experience_.

_The Urantia Book_ is replete with awe-inspiring quotes reminding us that personal, intimate fellowship with God is within reach of us all!

> _It is high time that man had a religious experience so personal and so sublime that it could be realized and expressed only by “feelings that lie too deep for words.”_ <a id="a57_171"></a>[UB 99:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_9)
