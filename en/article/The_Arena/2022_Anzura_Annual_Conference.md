**21 to 24 October 2022**

After two years of virtual conferences, we are optimistic and delighted to invite you to this year’s annual ANZURA conference which is being held as a face-to-face event in October of this year in the stunning tourist destination of Port Arthur in Tasmania. So dust off those unused travel bags and treat yourselves to a long weekend of inspiring experiences and socialising with kindred spirits.

The venue has changed since our first announcement. Instead of holding the conference at the Fox & Hounds Inn we will now be meeting at **Stewarts Bay Lodge** which is set in a stunning waterfront location and is nestled in a world heritage listed national park. It is within walking distance to Port Arthur’s Historic Site. Stewarts Bay Lodge offers a variety of quality self-contained cabin and chalet accommodation with restaurant, function rooms and recreation facilities all surrounded by a white-sand beach, crystal clear ocean waters and beautiful woodlands.

## Theme: Walking the ROPE – An Invitation to Intimacy with God

The ‘ROPE’ in the theme title is an acronym for the **R**eligion **O**f **P**ersonal **E**xperience so the full meaning of the theme title translates to ‘Walking the Religion of Personal Experience – An Invitation to Intimacy with God’. We hope that this will be a truly enriching spiritual experience for all who attend, either in person or via Zoom. We will be talking about the _ultimate human experience_.

_The Urantia Book_ is replete with awe-inspiring quotes reminding us that personal, intimate fellowship with God is within reach of us all!

> _It is high time that man had a religious experience so personal and so sublime that it could be realized and expressed only by “feelings that lie too deep for words.”_ <a id="a54_171"></a>[UB 99:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_9)
