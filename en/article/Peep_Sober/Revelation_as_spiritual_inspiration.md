From August 18 to 20, 51 Estonian readers gathered at the Karepa children's camp to participate in our conference. As if it were already a tradition, we had visits from foreign readers. They were Rebecca Oswald from the United States, Seppo Kanerva, Kalevi and Marja-Leena Eklöf from Finland. On the evening of the first day, the Estonian Urantia Association (EUA) held its general meeting. Peep Sõber was re-elected president, Tiia Reiksaar secretary and Helje Heinoja treasurer. The EUA now consists of 16 members and 17 supporters. We decided to publish our own Journal as well as to hold our summer conference in August 2002, immediately after the IU A International Conference in Paris. In this way, many of our friends, young and old, will be able to visit us.

It was Peep Sõber who opened by presenting the translation of the speech he gave at the IUA conference in New York, speech entitled “Sharing our spiritual life”. The second conference entitled “Philosophy of spiritual life” was presented by Veikko Raagmets. This was a wonderful example of the use of modern presentation techniques: a video projector connected to a computer and using the Power Point program. This talk is aimed at new readers and presents the book in an engaging way. The work that Veikko has done can be translated into other languages.

The third conference entitled “About Time and Eternity” was offered to us by Tiia Reiksaar. On the last day we read the lecture by Joel Rehnström, who was with us in spirit but not physically. For the last lecture, our scientist from the University of Tartu, Vello Reeben, explained his theories on the mathematical analysis of the different rhythms found in the universe. According to his conclusions, the years 1934 and 1935 marked the zenith of long rhythms on Urantia, making it a very favorable time for the birth of a new religion. According to his explanations, all epochal revelations began at a time period in accordance with the Paradise-Havona day.

During the conference we had a time of meditation and worship in the morning; there were five workshop groups. For the majority of readers who participated it was their first conference, they were very satisfied and decided to concentrate more on these teachings.
