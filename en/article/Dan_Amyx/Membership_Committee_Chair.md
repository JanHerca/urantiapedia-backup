The Membership Committee has been working on ways to more effectively support our Societies and membership in general. We are identifying areas in our structure so that we may improve our outreach and support.

Part of this evaluation includes our role in the website migration to the Wild Apricot platform. The evolutionary transition from the old site to this new one allows us to make changes and improvements that otherwise would be impossible. Automated functions within the new website will streamline our work, making The Fellowship more responsive to the needs of members and supporters.

Additionally, the committee is involved in a process of interviewing various religious and non-religious non-profit organizations in order to understand their structure and how they interact with their membership. With a volunteer General Council, we need to find ways to improve our organizational response and support mechanisms that augment our present skill set.

Previous discussions and interviews with officers and former officers of our Societies have contributed to a re-evaluation of our raison de être. Many of our members are “aging out” and we need to concentrate on more effective methods of reaching younger readers. Taking a more active role in this process has been both exciting and mindstretching for our committee. The future is ours to create, and our actions today shape the Urantia community of tomorrow. It is exhilarating to begin this journey on an untrodden path, in order to make way for those that follow.

We invite you to join us with your ideas, experiences, or your participation.
