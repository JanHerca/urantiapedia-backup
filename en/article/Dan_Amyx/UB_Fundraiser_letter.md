I have long been a reader of _The Urantia Book_. In the beginning, I felt that proselytizing the book was the best thing for me to do. I told so many people about this wonderful book, only to have them give the book back, or worse, threaten to burn it. After many disappointments, I learned that there were few people who were interested in pursuing these higher truths, or maybe I just didn't know how to present it.

Over time I found myself getting involved with our local community of readers. It seemed that the best way to become successful at Urantia outreach was to be part of a community of believers who worked and learned together, thereby 1mprovmg their personal understanding and their ability to communicate these wonderful and liberating concepts to non-readers.

I then discovered that few people ever take reading _The Urantia Book_ into deeper involvement with the reader community or mto outward service in general. Even our local comm_unity had only a small percentage of Urantians who were willing to step-up to pos1t10ns o_f responsibility within the group. For some, 1t was a matter of ability, for others a matter of motivation, and still others a matter of time. The work for the many, was mostly done by a _few_.

Decades after finding this big blue book in a bookstore, I now find great satisfaction in working within the Urantia Fellowship as a Committee Chair. However, with the wisdom and understanding garnered from past  experiences, I still find that it's only a few people accomplishing the big tasks required to support our Urantia community as well as those who are interested in our revelation. 

The work required is only one aspect in the revelation's scope and future. Material resources are critical to the many projects, meetmgs, outreach efforts, conferences and study efforts needed to enhance the human understanding of these profound and multilevelled teachings. _The Urantia Book_ tells us this, “Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together-all at the same moment.” 

The “lesson of the part and the whole” also tells us that, “The part profits or suffers in measure with the whole. The good effort of each man benefits all men; the error or evil of each man augments the tribulation of all men.” This means that we all have to climb higher and try harder to help our fellows achieve advanced levels as well. We are individuals, but we are also a group, a umf1ed system that must be in a form of stasis in order to progress.

Therefore, if you are not able to get involved in a Urantia organization like the Urantia Book Fellowship, perhaps you can help us in this work by donating to our efforts. No donation is too small, but more achieves more, and is _always_ deeply appreciated. Please, help us to spread these teachings eff1c1ently and effectively. _The Urantia Book_ tells us that there are few jobs in the universes for the lone actor. Here is _your_ opportunity to be part of this active and dedicated organization. Here is _your_ chance to reveal the real Gospel of Jesus. Please, donate today and contribute your talents if you are able.
