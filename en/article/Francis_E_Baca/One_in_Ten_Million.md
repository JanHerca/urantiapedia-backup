It seemed you were favored, Urantia. 
With gifted Prince Caligastia at the helm 
Progress was smooth 
You abode in the truth 
A bright future for the immature realm. 

Then the System Sovereign let darkness enfold him 
Exalting himself Lucifer went astray 
Assuring worlds he would lead them 
To “self-determination” and “freedom” 
There was war in the heavens that day. 

Lucifer’s aide, Satan, came to Caligastia 
And urged him to join in their plan 
To spurn evolution 
And embrace revolution 
Progress ended and mayhem began. 

It was a catastrophe of chaos and confusion 
Bitter harvest of the Prince’s betrayal 
“Liberated” peoples on a rampage 
A speedy end to the rebels’ new age 
Urantia adrift, like a ship with no sail. 

Yet throughout the grim years of rebellion 
A saga of valor and heroism was told 
Of Van and Amadon, who stood fast 
With Gabriel’s armies to the last 
Gallant leaders of the Father’s shattered fold. 

Spiritual dark ages followed 
In savagery the races continued to languish 
Still Van did not falter 
He said a Material Son and Daughter 
Would come to lift the world out from its anguish. 

Van’s followers built the Garden of Eden 
And what joy when the day finally came 
For the world to receive 
Its new rulers, Adam and Eve 
And all thanked the Father, praising his name. 

But isolated and alone on a rebellion ravaged sphere 
Adam and Eve’s bright hopes turned to despair 
Caligastia, sly and adroit 
Seized the opportunity to exploit 
The frustration of the well-meaning pair. 

Although warned not to mix good with evil 
The noble duo would become impatient and stray 
Reduced to mortals they fled 
The lands near Eden flowed red 
The apostate Prince once again had his way. 

Oh Urantia, what more can befall you 
Is there no end to your sorrowful plight 
Are you doomed to remain 
In misery and pain 
Have you any strength with to fight? 

But the Creator Son had not forgotten Urantia 
When Michael enacted his final bestowal 
Of ten million worlds he chose 
The neediest of those 
To reveal the Father’s mercy and love for us all. 

Melchizedek and John the Baptist made ready the way 
For Jesus, who the dust of earth trod 
Consumed with the desire 
To do the Father’s will and inspire 
Mankind to live as brethren in one family of God. 

Christ’s bestowal brought an end to insurrection 
And the wicked rebels have ever since 
Been stripped of all power 
Can only helplessly cower 
Before the man-God, the planet’s new Prince. 

Urantia remains a sin-darkened sphere 
Though with an Archangels division at hand 
And the universe humming 
Over Christ’s second coming 
It rides the threshold of a future quite grand. 

You’re one in ten million, Urantia 
And when all is said and done 
This “World of the Cross” 
Of suffering and loss 
Is the envy of all Nebadon. 
One in Ten Million
