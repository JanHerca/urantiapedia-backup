_By Barry Clark, Ft Lee, New Jersey, USA, and Mo Siegel, Boulder, Colorado, USA, IT Roundtable co-chairs_

On the weekend of October 2021,2012 , a group of highly tech-savvy Urantia Book readers, along with the presidents of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, Urantia Association International, and Urantia Foundation, met at 533 W Diversey Parkway in Chicago for the purpose of exploring technological cooperation across a wide variety of existing and potential services.

The discussions focused on technology-based dissemination and reader service opportunities in the social media realm (for example, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube), videography, eText publication, and other technology-based reader services —all of which were considered within the global context of a highly diverse and multi-lingual readership.

The camaraderie, the mutual respect, and the loving spirit of peace and goodwill among all of the group members cannot go unmentioned. It was palpable and directly experiencible and was expressed in honest communication and a spirit of cooperation and with a sincere interest in collaboration towards the goals we share.

And it is in this spirit of cooperation that the Urantia Book IT Roundtable will continue to pursue its mission, which is: _Leveraging technology to further the Urantia Revelation and continually improving global reader services_.
