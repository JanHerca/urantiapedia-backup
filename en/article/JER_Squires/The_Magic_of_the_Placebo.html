<p>The Magic of the Placebo.</p>
<p>A placebo is a pharmacologically inert substance administered blind (unknown to them) to a control group in a test procedure as a way of detecting the activity of substances or procedures purported to be effective in treating a particular illness.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the patient’s belief in the effectiveness of a drug or treatment often either brings about a cure or improvement in itself—the placebo effect.</p>
<p>This fact creates a situation calling out for “philosophical” therapy.</p>
<p>There are conditions (such as warts for example) where there is no known treatment that is effective— unless the patient has faith in the effectiveness of the treatment.</p>
<p>How can someone who has this faith actually be cured of what is known to be a real physical disorder, and not just something that is in the mind of that patient (warts are associated with infection by an identified virus)?</p>
<p>Suppose that I am a warty skeptic who is realist enough to realize that if I firmly believe my warts will go away as a result of a treatment, then they actually will.</p>
<p>How can I cultivate that belief without selling out on my critical soul? I am assured by the “experts” that I cannot avail myself of the cure except that I surrender to irrationality. So my dilemma becomes, “If I cure my warts I kill my rational soul.”</p>
<p>Whoever said rationality had survival value?</p>
