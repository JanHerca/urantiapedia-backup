_By Christian Ruch, Chur, Switzerland_

It was an amiable group, which came together in Frankfurt, Germany during the last weekend in April for the third meeting of the Blue Club. Have you ever heard of the Blue Club? It is a private, non-institutional fellowship of European readers of _The Urantia Book_, who hail from the south of Spain to the north of Finland. Three years ago some people had the idea to talk, to exchange experiences, and to have a good time together in a relaxed and casual atmosphere. The idea became a reality, and we had our first meeting in 2011 (also in Frankfurt.) Someone there had the idea to call us the Blue Club—the color of the three blue concentric circles.

Last year we met in the charming City of Lights, Paris, and this year we met again in Frankfurt. The hotel there knows the “Urantia” people quite well because it is also where the German readers have their November annual meetings.

It was indeed a pleasure at this year's gathering of the Blue Club to welcome readers from Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Some of the readers from Austria, Germany, and Norway had been wanting to connect with other readers for many years. For them, it felt like a home coming, and it was an emotional occasion.

Chris Wood, the new president of Urantia Association International (UAI) also came. I think it was important for him to see what is going on in Europe.

There were many topics of discussion at the meeting. Since the attendees hailed from many different countries, we discussed personal and group experiences with disseminating _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. We what does not work.

Erwin DeCraecker is very successful at starting new study groups in southern Germany. He spoke about his experiences in presenting _The Urantia Book_ at book fairs and shared very useful instructions on how to talk with people about this big, thick book.

Michael MacIsaac helped us to recharge our spiritual batteries by having us discuss in small groups how _The Urantia Book_ affects our daily lives.

The final item on our agenda was to discuss and plan for a also shared what works and “big” European conference, which will take place in Berlin from August 21-24, 2014. We hope that you will join us and meet the European readers of _The Urantia Book_!
