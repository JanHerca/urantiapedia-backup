The progress angels. These seraphim are entrusted with the task of initiating the evolutionary progress of the successive social ages. They foster the development of the inherent progressive trend of evolutionary creatures; they labor incessantly to make things what they ought to be. <a id="a44_285"></a>[UB 114:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_5)

These Angels of Progress are a unique group of master seraphim assigned to our world. “.... they manipulate planetary conditions and so associate circumstances as to favorably influence the spheres of human activity to which they are attached. While unable to inject new and higher conceptions into human minds, they often act to intensify some higher ideal which has already appeared within a human intellect.” <a id="a46_412"></a>[UB 114:6.17-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_17)

I love the fact that these angels “...labor incessantly to make things what they _ought_ to be.” <a id="a48_97"></a>[UB 114:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_5) It appears that they work to make all things equal, respectful, balanced and representative - to make things right, just and true. It also occurs to me that they work with actions and values, not in word only, but with Spirit-infused action. Their work is valuedriven. That is where the purpose and heart of the matter, spirit, come together! They do good to ensure a better future that gives our world hope, optimism and gratitude as we strive for a better society. They are agents of change!
