## Marvin Gawryn

Hi Friends,

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">

Good news! I received word from the organizers of the Parliament of the World's Religions that the workshop proposal I submitted was accepted! It will be scheduled during the 4th, 5th or 6th day of the Parliament, so there will be time to circulate flyers during the first few days of the event. Please feel free to share this around, as you feel appropriate. Here (below) are the workshop proposal particulars, some of which will be printed in the Schedule that all participants will receive.

I'll be in touch as I have further details ... Love to you all! Marvin

“A Way of Life in the Family of God: The Global Vision of the Urantia Book” 

_The Urantia Book_ purports to be a major revelation to our world, authored by higher celestial beings. It describes our relationship with God, the purpose of our lives, the history  and destiny of our world, the trillions of inhabited worlds, a full description of the afterlife, and the complete life and teachings of Jesus.

We will explore the book's vision of an emerging global civilization, based on seven essential spiritual truths that comprise “A Way of Life in the Family of God”:
- The Spiritual Parent Child Relationship
- The Spiritual Sister Brother Relationship
- The Indwelling Spirit 
- The Will of God
- Love 
- Eternal Life 
- Faith

How does your session relate to the 2018 Parliament theme of “The Promise of Inclusion and the Power of Love: Pursing Global Understanding, Reconciliation, and Change”?:

_The Urantia Book_ envisions a world where the Creator's Love, unfolding within the universal Family of God (which transcends every human institution), heals our wounded sense of self, profoundly transforms how we treat each other, and re-imagines our differences of race, religion, gender, ethnicity, and nationality as a great spiritual gift, the glorious flowering of the diverse global family that God intended us to be. Notwithstanding the many opposing tendencies in human nature and society, this mighty ideal will eventually inspire the emergence of our next and higher stage of civilization. In order to work toward it with all of our passion, we must very clearly visualize the ideal, and then pursue it. 

**Primary Presenter Short Biographical Information:** Marvin Gawryn, a multi-faith minister, works as the Executive Director of the Interfaith Council of Southern Nevada (a URI Cooperation Circle), and has been a lifelong student of the Urantia Book. 

Marvin Gawryn worked for thirty years as a Family Therapist, and currently serves as the Executive Director of the Interfaith Council of Southern Nevada (a URI CC). He has participated in the interfaith movement for over thirty years, studied the history and sociology of religion at GTU, and explored Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christian contemplative practices. His theology is grounded in the Urantia Book, a 2100 page revealed text, which he has studied for over 45 years. When asked how they were raised, his two grown daughters, one of whom converted to Islam, say “We grew up in an interfaith family.”

“Beyond Prejudice, Bias & Bigotry, Toward the Golden Rule, Camp Anytown”

This presentation will help the audience to appreciate the power of Camp Anytown, as a transformational event, to help people to move beyond prejudice, bias & bigotry, toward a Golden Rule culture. We have been doing Camp Anytown over 20 years and have consistently witnessed the transformation of perspective in its participants. This proven model can help other communities. Graduates have become leaders in our community, have become part of the network of a new culture of compassion, have had their lives transformed. This session will demonstrate the effectiveness of Camp Anytown, provide the tools to get started in spreading the good work of Camp Anytown. Interfaith work must be about the transformation of the lives and perspectives of those it touches, leading to greater circles of trust, compassion and wisdom.

“How we can transition from Fragmentation to Integration?” under the Living Religious Pluralism heading (3 workshops in 1) 

People of faith make up the largest segment of the world population. It is therefore people of faith that have the greatest responsibility and opportunity to end intolerance. In this short presentation we will explore the concept and role of “world view” in the movement from fragmentation to integration. We will also explore what it will take to build a worldview which fosters a sense of common identity that transcends current divisions and rivalries. 

How does this session relate to the 2018 Parliament theme of “The Promise of Inclusion and the Power of Love: Pursing Global Understanding, Reconciliation, and Change”?

This session goes to the core of the 2018 Parliament theme. No society can attain ideal levels of functioning until every form of intolerance is overcome. Religious intolerance is the eight-hundred-pound gorilla sitting squarely in the middle of so many horrific transgressions against humanity throughout past and present history. If the possibility exists that lack of unity in the intelligent comprehension of the universe is at the root of so much misunderstanding; that the resulting philosophical chaos is fostering spiritual stagnation in our society, then it is our responsibility and our privilege to come together to better understand this phenomenon and explore ways to address it.
