_By Mo Siegel, President, Urantia Foundation, Colorado, USA_

Dear co-workers and friends of Urantia Foundation and the Urantia Revelation,

Would you have ever imagined in your wildest dreams that you would find yourself participating in the dissemination of the most liberating spiritual truths since Jesus walked on earth? While our work, as readers of _The Urantia Book_, may be quiet and lacking of public attention, our job resembles the Master's activities preceding his public ministry as he prepared the way for the future reception of truth. If it takes 1,000 years for the Urantia Revelation to unfold, then we have just completed the first seven percent of the journey. These are the days for preparing the soil and planting seeds for future generations who will reap the harvest of this new spiritual awaking destined to transform our world.

The following report will inform you of Urantia Foundation's accomplishments in 2009 and will give you a look into what is anticipated in the future. Your feedback is always welcome.

## Highlights of 2009

## 1. Book Publishing and Translations

- Urantia Book sales totaled more than 14,000 books, a five percent increase from 2008. (This number does not include the thousands of books downloaded via the internet.) English Urantia Book sales exceeded 6,500 books, and the Spanish and Portuguese translations followed as the second and third best sellers.
- Standardized Text and Referencing System

  The Trustees approved a Standard Reference Text and a referencing system, which together will have a significant impact on protecting the text while providing extensive educational capabilities.

  Digital texts in English and Spanish were created, proof read, and made ready for print and digital publication using the Standard Referencing System. All translations will be converted to this new system within the next few years.

- A Text Identification Numbering System was conceived, approved, and adopted. This system will provide easy identification of all English editions and translations thereof, be they on the web, in revision, or in printed books.
- The Portuguese Translation Revision

  Luiz Carlos Dolabela Chagas, the translator of the Portuguese translation, completed a revision with approximately 15,000 changes that will be included in the next printing. Kudos to Luiz!

- _El Libro de Urantia_ edición europea

  The European edition of the Spanish translation was printed and launched in Spain. This edition was printed for the European market, and the Board has restricted sales to Europe.

- Book Reprinting

  The Lithuanian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish translations were reprinted.

- New Book Distributors

	Contracts were signed with new distributors in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Quebec.

- New Book Distribution System in Europe

	A centralized storing, shipping and billing system was established for the European Union.

- French Audio Version

	A team of French Canadians produced an audio version of _The Urantia Book_ in French, which is now available to readers.

- English Audio Tapes

	The audio tapes of _The Urantia Book_ were converted to a new digital format and made ready for multiple purposes. This new format will greatly reduce storage space and download time.

- Formatting of Four New Translations

	The formatting for the upcoming printings of Estonian, Hungarian, Polish, and Swedish translations was almost completed.

- A Translator's Meeting was held in Paris, France in August, 2009.


## 2. Fund Raising and Frugality

Urantia Foundation relies on the support of generous readers. Annual profits from book sales provide about five percent of the operating budgets. Ninety-five percent comes from donations. Knowing that many readers suffered financially in 2009 , the Trustees launched a year-end matching fund drive with some uncertainty. The target was $210,000, and donors generously contributed $215,000. Donors, thank you for your support!

Expenses were managed tightly in 2009, and this same conservative spending will continue in 2010. The Board and team at 533 operate frugally and spend money only on necessities.

## 3. New Website at www.urantia.org

In December 2009, Urantia Foundation launched its new and improved website. While there are numerous improvements yet to come, the up and running site is very user friendly. The robust software system used to build the site provides for multiple languages. Operational use in 14 languages is expected within the next few years.

## 4. Education

- Two hundred students participated in 11 courses offered by the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS).
- Readers residing in 17 countries participated.
- Nine students completed the UBIS Teacher Training class. (UBIS currently has a core staff of 13 teachers.)
- UBIS upgraded its software to improve the quality of the classes.
- An Educational Forum was held in Chicago at Urantia Foundation.
- Foundation members participated in the Parliament of the World's Religions in Australia.


## 5. Organizational Activities

- Four Board meetings were held, including one in Malaga, Spain.
- A community-based Information Technology (IT) Roundtable was held in October at Urantia Foundation. 16 readers who are involved with IT gathered to discuss IT needs, problems, and solutions that will benefit the Urantia Book community.
- Urantia Foundation emailed four newsletters and an annual report.


## 6. The Building at 533 Diversey Parkway

For many, the Foundation's building is an important asset to the Urantia Community. Therefore, we need to maintain it.

In 2009, an office on the second floor was converted into a bedroom. All the outside windows were either repaired or replaced. The building requires a great deal of upkeep and renovation, and $150,000 could easily be spent on needed improvements.

The building is now available for use by readers desiring a place to meet. The second floor has five bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, and two meeting rooms. Please take advantage of this opportunity to use the second floor. It is a community treasure that we would like to share.

The accomplishments of 2009 happened because of team efforts made by the staff at Diversey Parkway, the Board of Trustees, the committees of the Board, the donors to Urantia Foundation, the translators, the website development team, and the dedicated volunteers. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, heartfelt thanks go to everyone who worked for the Urantia Revelation by serving with Urantia Foundation in 2009.

## Planning for 2010-2015

In preparation for the years ahead, the Expanded Board spent half of their January 2010 meeting planning for the future. Below you will read what we agreed upon. I must admit that I get tired just looking at this list, let alone working on it. But our team feels that the goals are achievable and, if accomplished, will make the world a better place. We welcome your thoughts regarding these plans for the future.

## VISION STATEMENT

The Principal and Concordant Objects from the Declaration of Trust are our vision statement.

PRINCIPAL OBJECT: The object for which this Foundation is created is the promotion, improvement, and expansion among the peoples of the world of the comprehension and understanding of Cosmology and the relation of the planet on which we live to the Universe, of the genesis and destiny of Man and his relation to God, and of the true teachings of Jesus Christ; and for the inculcation and encouragement of the realization and appreciation of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man—in order to increase and enhance the comfort, happiness, and well being of Man, as an individual and as a member of society, through the fostering of a religion, a philosophy, and a cosmology which are commensurate with Man's intellectual and cultural development.
