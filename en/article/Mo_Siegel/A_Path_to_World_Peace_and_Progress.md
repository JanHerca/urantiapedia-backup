_By Mo Siegel, president, Urantia Foundation, on behalf of the Board of Trustees_

In these tumultuous times of global unrest and conflict, it’s clear that the profound teachings in _The Urantia Book_ are the long-term solution to achieve world peace and progress. Adversity may spur growth, but prejudice, hatred, and war only impede our collective journey toward a peaceful and united world.

Your financial support has never been more significant. Here are seven reasons why:

1. _The Urantia Book_ illuminates the way to true and enduring peace—recognizing and living by the truth that we are all children of the same divine, loving Creator and, therefore, inherently brothers and sisters.
2. “Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” <a id="a47_121"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3) _The Urantia Book_ offers an unparalleled account of his life and teachings.
3. No spiritual movement thrives without its adherents sharing its redemptive message. The most effective dissemination occurs by placing the inviolate text of _The Urantia Book_ into the hands of spiritually hungry people.
4. Since 1950, Urantia Foundation has been the dedicated custodian of this revelation. With the book now in 26 languages and physically and digitally available across the globe, we continue our unwavering commitment to protect, translate, and disseminate _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings.
5. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Given the current economic climate worldwide, we lose money on book sales. The more we sell, the more we lose. Yet, our mandate is clear: to share this revelatory text and its teachings unreservedly.
6. Your giving has a direct and lasting impact on our world's spiritual evolution. Your donation is more than a gift; it’s a legacy that will echo through time. You are part of an extraordinary chapter in our spiritual history—a time that future generations will look upon with gratitude.
7. A group of five generous donors has pledged a combined total of $250,000, promising to match every dollar raised. Your matched gift is not just a donation—it's an investment in a brighter, more enlightened future for our planet.

Please help us achieve our goal by December 31.
