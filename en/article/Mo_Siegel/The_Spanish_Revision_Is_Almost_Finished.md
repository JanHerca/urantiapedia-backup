_By Mo Siegel, president, Urantia Foundation, Colorado, United States_

After nine years in the making, the newly revised Spanish Urantia Book will launch in early 2021 . That's why the revision team gathered in Chicago in early September. The team consists of Víctor García-Bory from Mexico, Carmelo Martínez and Olga López from Spain, Anibal Pacheco from Chile, and Raúl Pujol from Puerto Rico. They met to finish up some remaining work and to celebrate the upcoming book.

Over time, translations need improving, and the current Spanish books are no exception. This new revision is faithful to the English original, linguistically accurate, and stylistically beautiful. The team preserved as much as possible of the 1993 Latin American translation, while using the European translation as a reference tool.

Regardless of the life challenges each member faced over such an extended period, everyone remained committed to the project. Sickness, job changes, and family obligations didn't deter this selfless volunteer team. They spent thousands of hours tediously making, word by word, needed improvements. We all feel deep gratitude for the tremendous accomplishment of seeing this project through!

The final stages of the Spanish revision project remain. Over the next several months, we will be providing you with updates. For now, please join me in thanking our revision team for the amazing gift of love they've created for Spanish-speaking people around the world.
