_By Antonio Moya, Spain_

Antonio Moya was born in 1948 in Seville, Spain. When he was 26 years old, he started investigating phenomena such as UFOs, Ouija Boards, extraterrestrial contacts, spiritualism, mediumship, revealed books, and so on. He found the French translation of _The Urantia Book_ at the age of 30, and since then, his life has never been the same.

He participated in reading and correcting the first few Papers of the 1993 Spanish translation, but he ceased participating in this effort when he had such divergent opinions from the other reviewers. In 1995, Urantia Foundation asked Antonio to revise and correct the Spanish translation. He was assisted by members of his study group (consisting of 10 to 12 people) and by Seppo Kanerva, who was Urantia Foundation's Manager of Translations. This revisionretranslation took about seven years.

Antonio believes that _The Urantia Book_ is very important to the world. If all people begin to live its teachings, human society will advance in a very short time. He hopes that _The Urantia Book_ will be read and studied by the vast majority of people so that our world soon realizes The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
