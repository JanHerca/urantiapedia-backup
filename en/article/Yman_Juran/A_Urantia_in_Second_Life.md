My name is Yman Juran and in real life I am a performer and have been traveling with my Danish ChangHigh Circus for 39 years. It's a special children's circus where we teach and travel with kids of all ages in

Scandinavia, Europe and the Middle East. I was born inside my first virtual game, called Second Life (SL) on the 27th of February 2007. Like a newborn babe, I had never before played any computer game, had no idea how it functioned, what I would be able to do or experience, but I was soon to learn because I had this idea to create in virtuality, the same circus as I had in real life. But I was soon to discover and experience a completely new world.

You initially join the virtual world by creating yourself as an avatar, any kind of living creature from a snail to a fire-juggling trapeze artist, a Sister of Light, Life and Love, to a Solitary Messenger! Imagine yourself as a midwayer, a seraphim, a Solemnity of Trust, a Mighty Messenger! You can be whatever you create. You will meet all kinds of creatures in Second Life and behind each one is a living personality in front of a computer somewhere in the world and you can have a relationship with any of them, either virtual or real! Second Life or SL is a grand creation of many worlds, in which you can select to live, participating in an endless array of imaginative and educational experiences.

I wanted to create a performing circus troupe, with a message of wisdom, peace, enlightenment and love, to uplift the SecondLife community and culture by offering shows with performances that enrich and elevate the souls and spirits of those who are present. I wanted to create a spiritual impression within the minds of the audience.

Within SL I have created a homeland, my base where a virtual version of the 2100 page Urantia Book can be offered free and shared when you click a vendor. I always open my show by saying: “We welcome you to a performance done in inspiration and appreciation to The Mighty Acts of The Gods who support humanity in its progressive future of creativity and culture here in SL as well as in reality...”

“The high mission of any art is, by its illusions, to foreshadow a higher universe reality, to crystallize the emotions of time into the thought of eternity.”

“Please turn Yourself on to a Universe of Light, Life and Love... and let us share our joy in a forever immortal conquest for truth, goodness, and beauty. Because truly 'Life is the ultimate gift of love'...so keep your faith in the creativity of The Gods. They created You and all within the universe of universes.” And the show begins: acrobatic animations; fire dancing with pois, sticks; fans all on podiums, in rotating trapezes, on walking elephants, or rolling earth balls; and in the end my DJ will say this, all written by me in a forwarded program:

“We thank You all for coming and like to give our blessings of Light, Life \& Love to you all, not only with hope but with the promise of divine immortality to you all, so your journey through the labyrinth of your mortal existence into immortality may be blessed and filled with Light, Life and Love....because the universe is very friendly, so you be likewise. We share this divine cosmic gift with you, because that is what eternal immortal life and love can do and IS.”

“Feel free to roam the universe of Light, Life and Love...because it is made for you and me...”

“The show was done in appreciation to all the children of the world to whom we are thankful.”

The show was hosted by 'The Spirit of Truth' - to support love between people on earth."

“See you in the future, and may Peace prevail among you all.”
