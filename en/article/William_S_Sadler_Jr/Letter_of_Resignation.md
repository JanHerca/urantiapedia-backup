Dear Christy:

I am hereby tendering my resignation as a member of the General Council, effective upon the receipt of this letter.

I find myself forced to do this because of recurring poor health and am acting on my Doctor's advice.

I want to wish my colleagues the very best of success in their ventures and regret the necessity of my resignation.

Cordially and sincerely,

(signed) Bill

William S. Sadler, Jr.
