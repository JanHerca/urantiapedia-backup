“What is the URANTIA Brotherhood? Another sect?” This question has been put to the writer of this report more than once. To this question, a negative answer has always been given, “No, the URANTIA Brotherhood is neither a church nor a sect. It is simply a social group which has a religious objective.”

There is a real place in modern civilization for a group of religious people who are “_... willing to completely divest themselves of all ecclesiastical authority and fully surrender all concept of spiritual sovereignty. God alone is spirit sovereign._” (<a id="a38_255"></a>[UB 134:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_4)). The modern world hardly needs another church, another sect. At the present time, we suffer from a plethora of churches and multiplication of sects.

But, if we are not a church, how then do we differ from a church? If we can clearly see how we differ, then perchance we can maintain such differences. And, if we can maintain these differences, then we may be able to preserve our organization as a distinctive Brotherhood; we may be able to avoid a possible evolution in the direction of a church.

Well, right on the face of it, there are three main differences between the Brotherhood and a typical church: We claim no spiritual sovereignty; we claim no exclusive path to salvation; we claim no ecclesiastical authority. So long as we do not claim these things we can hardly become a church.

But, even if we are not a church, even if we never become a church, is it also true that we are not a sect? A Urantian could be a sectarian religionist; he could be a religionist who is primarily dedicated to the propagation of _The URANTIA Book_. Would such a dedication, however, be a valid dedication — in the light of all we know? The writer submits that such a dedication is not valid as a primary dedication. Such an exaltation of a most worthy secondary dedication to primary status could well transform a religious Urantian into a sectarian Urantian — a Urantian who has allowed the importance of _The URANTIA Book_ to take precedence over the importance of God.

How then can we, as Urantians, avoid not only churchification but also sectarianization? The writer believes that both of these unfortunate developments can be avoided if we are careful in distinguishing between means and ends. This is another way of saying that we should be careful not to confuse our secondary loyalties and our primary loyalties. The writer would accordingly submit for the careful consideration of the Brotherhood the following philosophy of action:

1. **God Is the Only True End**. Our primary spiritual loyalty and dedication is to the Universal Father, and to Him alone. When we encounter some spiritually hungry brother, our first objective is to bring him closer to his spiritual Father. This we may attempt with, or without, the book. All other things are secondary and subordinate to the acquisition of this one “pearl of great price” — the realization of sonship with God.
2. **_The URANTIA Book_ as a Means to the End**. The book itself is not an end — it is a most important means to an end. It is designed to bring God closer to man and to bring man closer to God. We may minister to our spiritually hungry brothers with or without the aid of _The URANTIA Book_. But if the book ever becomes mandatory in our ministry, then have we truly become sectarian. Our primary objective, as Urantians, is the service of God, and the book is an important means to that great end. Here we should make a vital distinction between that which _is_ value and that which _has_ value.
3. **The URANTIA Brotherhood as a Means to the End**. Neither is the URANTIA Brotherhood, nor membership in it, a true end. The real function of the Brotherhood is also the function of a means to accomplish a desired end. The structure of the Brotherhood is to the spiritual experiences of its members as the river banks are to a river, it is true that no river can be had without its banks — but neither should the banks be confused with the flowing river. The Brotherhood is designed to promote the book and the book is designed to bring God and man closer to each other.

If we can clearly separate means and ends, if we can always subordinate means to the true end, then we shall continue for a very long time as a real Brotherhood. And we shall avoid becoming merely another church or another sect in the world of the twentieth century, a world which needs neither a new church nor a new sect.
