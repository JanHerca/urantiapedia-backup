This is the story of the evolution of the seven superuniverses. Most of the Papers are concerned with this narrative. This is the tale of creation and evolution in time and space, and of how all these activities find their destiny in the perfected superuniverses under the sovereignty of the Supreme Being.

This story is presented in three Chapters:
- [Chapter I – The Creative Thesis of Perfection](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/1)
- [Chapter II – The Evolutionary Antithesis](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/2)
- [Chapter III – The Synthesis: God the Supreme](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/3)

This is the story of the Second Universe Age, the story of here and now. It begins with the creation of the Master Spirits and the Ancients of Days. It ends with the completed evolution of the Supreme Being.
