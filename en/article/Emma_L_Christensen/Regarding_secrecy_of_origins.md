TO OUR FIELD REPRESENTATIVES:

March 24, 1966

From:  E. L. Christensen, President, Urantia Brotherhood

CC:  Vern Grimsley, Berkeley Elliott, Julian Fenderson, James Mills, Meredith Sprunger

As we have been warned by our unseen friends, we are being besieged for information about the origin of the Urantia Book by many inquirers.  These people come to us with garbled stories, which must arise from information given out by our old-time Urantians.

We have send out a warning heretofore, regarding discussing the origin of the Book, but the stories keep coming.

Since you four represent the Brotherhood, I feel that I must quote to you some instructions given to us back in 1945.  These are STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

“You must begin the rehearsal of your attitude as it is to be manifested at the time of the publication of The Urantia Book.  You, as individuals and as a group, are only concerned with the teachings of the Book.  The origin of the Book is the concern of the contact commissioners.”

“At the time of the appearance of The Urantia Book, a solemn oath will be required of you to the end that you shall remain silent concerning aught you may chance to know about the origin of The Urantia Book throughout the remainder of your life.”

“Only may the contact commissioners give out information concerning the origin of the book…and they will be duly instructed as to how they shall conduct themselves regarding these matters.”

“…Your troubles will be greatly lessened if you avoid all discussion of the origin of the book.  Be determined to know but one thing – the soul-surviving message of the Book.”

Jesus was troubled during His life on this planet, by this interest in the miraculous.  His apostles were constantly urging Him to perform another miracle, but you will remember that He did not succumb to their urgings.  I think we should al learn a lesson fro this, the greatest of all teachers.

In 1945, following the receipt of the message fro which I have quoted above, all members of what was then the Forum, reaffirmed their pledge of secrecy by signing the following:

“I hereby reaffirm my pledge of secrecy regarding information imparted to me about the manner of receiving the subject matter of The Urantia Book, and the channel through which it came.”

If you care to do so, I would appreciate your signing the enclosed card and returning it to me.

May I count on you, as our representatives, to quash any and all of the weird stories that come to you regarding the origin of The Urantia Book?  And, as far as you personally are concerned, tell all inquirers that the only information you have about this is contained within the Book.  Had the revelators felt it necessary that some story be told, we would have been given one.

Let us not use a candle to light the way for a searchlight.
