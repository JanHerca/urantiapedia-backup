The Brotherhood is in crisis.

Alvin Kulieke, our President, is dead. Other officers will soon be resigning or moving from the area. The present Secretary General is losing her eyesight. We must bring in new people, and we must give attention to the office organization.

To date the Brotherhood has depended on volunteer help and one-half of a secretary, at a very low wage, to carry on its day-to-day business. I believe we must face the fact that the Brotherhood, if it is to have competent, capable people to carry on its business in the future, must be able to offer salaries which will draw and hold the right people.

It will be increasingly important to have an individual capable of efficiently running the office and keeping in close touch with the various societies. I believe we need a full-time President or other officer who can take charge of our organization and who can wisely labor for the stable growth and co-ordination of Urantia Brotherhood and its societies. Additionally, this person should be able and willing to travel in order to keep in personal touch with the field representatives, various societies, and study groups.

We must choose someone with stability, maturity, imagination, creativity and dedication — and one who can organize and get along with people. This person must not be too old or too young.

We must be able to offer a sustaining salary. The time is long past when we can wholly depend upon part-time help properly to carry out the business of the organization charged with the duty of wisely disseminating the Urantia Book.

I am not sure how we can promise both a good salary and job security to a well-qualified individual, but we must work it out.

Additionally, new secretaries will sometime be necessary to replace the present ones.

The old guard is passing on — we cannot allow Caligastia and those unfriendly to the Urantia Book to prevail. We must take steps to protect our organization and to provide for the orderly administration and growth of Urantia Brotherhood.
