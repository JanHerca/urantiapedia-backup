The past year has been an unusually busy one, although I have not had an opportunity to visit any groups or societies as I have done in the past. Our President has attended to these delightful activities.

I have had the pleasure of "minding the store" for Mr. Snider this last year. We get together on the average of two nights a week to go over mail and various projects and activities which are pending or are to be undertaken. He keeps in very close touch with office matters in spite of his very active job of earning a living.

Just now we are looking forward to John Hales' arrival about the 1st of September to take charge of these functions for me as Executive Director of the Brotherhood office. I will then hope to be a more or less inactive Vice President of the Urantia Brotherhood, but will still be busy with Urantia matters as my duties as Secretary of the Foundation will keep me from occupying the rocking chair too much.

Gradually we will get the help needed in this office. Our staff at present is inadequate but a very efficient and dedicated one which will be hard to replace.

So far in my life the word "leisure" has just been a dream and I haven't any idea how I will relate to it if it ever becomes a reality. My whole life has been an unprecedented and joyful experience, and since I thrive on meeting and talking with my brothers and sisters, it has also been an exhilarating one.

Hope to see you next year.
