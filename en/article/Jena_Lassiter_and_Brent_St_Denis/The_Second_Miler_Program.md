A fund to help _The Urantia Book_ reader community more effectively spread the depth and breadth of the revelation

## What's new?

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship wants to report on the “Second Miler Grant Program.” We launched a grant program in 2020 to support revelation development projects created by Urantia Book readers and communities worldwide.

Since the announcement of our pilot program, we received and review ed many diverse and creative proposals. With our successful pilot completed, we are now moving to open this fund to all members and bona fide Urantia Book readers and communities worldwide.

Do you have an idea of new or better ways to share the teachings of _The Urantia Book_?

Whether large or small, whether you are working alone or with your study group, society, or an informal group of other readers, you can apply for financial support from our Second Miler Grant Program. Go to our website, [urantiabook.org/About-The-Urantia-Book-Fellowship#second-miler](https://urantiabook.org/About-The-Urantia-Book-Fellowship#second-miler).

Annual program funding comes from investing a sustainable portion of Fellowship assets into the ideas and initiative of readers who are willing to go the second mile so that the world may share our gift of revelation (_The Urantia Book_).

## Let your imagination soar!

If you have an idea that is a revelationdevelopment project and you need some support to pursue your initiative then we want to hear from you.

Just to give you an idea of the range of projects currently underway ...

## TRUTH

- Video equipment purchases for videographers creating content for their YouTube channels based on _The Urantia Book_ teachings

- Purchase of a software application to create high-quality Urantia Book audio at the paragraph level embedded into an online Urantia Book for multiple translations

- Translation of a 76-page secondary work into Danish

- A resource book published on UB human source writings

- Scholarly essays about _The Urantia Book_ for researchers at universities and colleges titled Reason and Revelation

- Support for the completion of a scholarly book that is an academic and “neutral point of view” take on _The Urantia Book_ and movement that has influenced scientists, musicians and communities.

## BEAUTY

- Amusic CD and global website promoting various forms of art by Urantia Book readers around the world - Concerts promoting _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings

## GOODNESS

- Bicycles and technical infrastructure support in Uganda so leaders can reach farther into their communities with _The Urantia Book_ and start creating community and village-level meetings - Infrastructure to create meeting spaces for study in Cameroon
