_By Richard Keeler, Trustee, Urantia Foundation, Wyoming, USA_

_Death is not the end, but it is the end ... of the beginning when our Thought Adjusters take wing and start their long flight home._

Pat Mundelius was born on March 17, 1938. She was the granddaughter of Doctor William S. Sadler and was a former Trustee and president of Urantia Foundation. Pat graduated from Urantia on May 2, 2008. She died of pancreatic cancer.

On May 31, 2008, about thirty-five of Pat's friends and family gathered at the Mundelius residence in Danville, California, to celebrate Pat. For at least two hours the persons present spoke about Pat and their relationship with her. The memorial service was truly a celebration and was the most moving and meaningful service I have ever attended.

When everyone had spoken, Manfred, Pat's husband, read what appears below. Before reading it, he said that, about a week before Pat died, she asked him to bring her “that pad of yellow paper over there.” She wrote the following:

Darlings— for that is what you all are— my darlings, my family.
_The Urantia Book_ talks about all the wonderful gifts that God bestows on us, among which are three that I'd like to talk about.

The first and foremost is free will, without which we really wouldn't be human beings.

The second is a piece of Himself, which acts as a beacon to lead us in the right direction.

The third is the gift of all our brothers and sisters to share this great adventure.

When I think of the first two gifts, I hear Beethoven. When I think of the third, I hear Mozart.

_The Urantia Book_ says that most experiences are means to an end, but relationships with our fellows are ends in and of themselves.

My first friendship was with Barbara Sacks. We have been through almost all life experiences together: weddings, baby showers, memorial services. I love her dearly.

Then there are the famous Cronies — Marcia, Barbara Ageno, and Lynne. I don't know if I could have gotten through this without them. They are true sisters.

My sister-in-law, Judy, has been like an angel — always supportive.

My Urantia Foundation is very special to me. They are loving, kind, and supportive. I love them all dearly. One lady in particular, Tamara, I have adopted as an unofficial daughter. She is so sweet.

Another of my special families is my medical support team. Everyone knows how much I admire Margo Estrin. She is an angel. Also I particularly appreciate Mindy, who has such a compassionate heart. I have unofficially adopted her too.

Not that I had to go looking for daughters, for I have four fabulous daughters. They are all a mother-in-law could want. They are strong women with a soft and compassionate side. My sons chose wisely. 

My sons are fabulous. All different but share their sincere interest in their fellow man. I can't tell you how happy they make me. Each one of them is my most favorite son. They all know this, for I tell them often.

Then there is my best friend, who has been my best friend for over 50 years. He has always been admired by me. He is the love of my life. But it is in the last segment of my life that he has grown in a way I didn't think possible. I so appreciate that I got to see this side of him. I will be waiting on the shores of the mansion worlds for you.

Now I wish you to share your relationships with each other. And be of good cheer. Auf wiedersehen for a while. Go spin the web of relationships and laugh at all our good times. I love you all.
