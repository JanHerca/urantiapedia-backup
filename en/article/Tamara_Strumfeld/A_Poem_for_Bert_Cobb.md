Long-time Urantia Book reader Roland 'Bert' Cobb of Jerome, Idaho, is a dear friend of mine and many of us. He graduated with grace and faith from this world during the early morning hours of September 12, 2009. Resting quietly in the house that he built, he spent his last days in the care of his three children. There will be a memorial service at noon on October 3 at 330 Canyon Crest Drive, Twin Falls, Idaho.

He sought to live by the profound wisdom and cosmic perspective gleaned from the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. He was a master electrician and volunteered his services at Urantia Foundation headquarters. His favorite pastime was packing his mules and horses into the beautiful high country of the Sawtooth National Forest, and two years ago, I was privileged to accompany him on such a trip. Bert was an ordained minister, a world traveler, a deer and elk hunter (who ate everything he killed), and a cowboy poet. His poem “Jesus Was a Working Man” was set to music and recorded as a country song.

A few weeks ago, a group of Urantia Book readers celebrated Jesus' birthday at Bert's homestead, which he called “A Place in Time and Space.” At this gathering, during Bob Solone's musical performance, I recited a poem that I had composed for this occasion. Several of the attendees encouraged me to share it with all of you in this newsletter, and it is reproduced below.

**BERTITO BERT BERTIE**

I remember the moment when I met Bert<br>
It was summer 2004<br>
We were hosting a conference for the then IUA<br>
I was running _The Urantia Book_ store<br>

Well, I saw a man that I hadn't met yet<br>
He had a particular charm<br>
So I went over and told him my name<br>
He just wrapped me in his big lovin' arms<br>

You see, Bert and I had heard of each other<br>
Through friends that we both hold dear<br>
And ever since that opening hug<br>
Our friendship has been most sincere<br>

It's only been five years since l've known him <br>
But we sure have had our fun <br>
Be it packing into the Little Wood <br>
Or walking in the Buenos Aires sun<br>

And then there's the weeks we spent in Chicago <br>
Bert came the past two years <br>
We decked the halls at 533 <br>
And spread lots of holiday cheer <br>

There were plenty of visits to old Jerome <br>
The place in time and space <br>
lorious walks in the Snake River Canyon <br>
Bertie always kept a good pace<br>

Delicious meals, laughter, all our good jokes <br>
I could go on all day<br>
Cause when it comes to my Bertito<br>
There's just so much to say<br>

But there were also times of silence <br>
That Bertie and I did share<br>
Times of loving worship<br>
Meditation and prayer<br>

We both do love the Father<br>
At the center of all things<br>
And we thank him for the peace of mind <br>
That knowing him does bring<br>

We also love this special time <br>
Of the present revelation <br>
It sure binds up the broken souls <br>
With its spiritual medication<br>

It sheds great light on what's to come <br>
The plan of our Ascension <br>
nd how God draws us to his breast <br>
Through spiritual tension<br>

It also tells of worlds advanced <br>
That in death there is no grieving <br>
But I must honestly confess <br>
I'm sad that Bert is leaving<br>

How l'll miss our conversations <br>
We had several times each week <br>
Sharing details of our daily lives <br>
And higher values that we seek<br>

But there's also comfort in my heart <br>
And joy for the occasion<br>
Bertie's embarking upon an exciting trip<br>
With a glorious destination<br>

We'll all be going there as well<br>
When our time arrives <br>
We're headed to the Mansion Worlds <br>
Ever beckoning on high<br>

It's grand to think of you awakening <br>
And getting settled down up there <br>
Your soul housed in a morontia body <br>
Withstanding plenty of wear and tear<br>

So until our next reunion<br>
The Master's peace be close to heart <br>
I wish you Godspeed, my friend <br>
I love you with all my heart<br>
