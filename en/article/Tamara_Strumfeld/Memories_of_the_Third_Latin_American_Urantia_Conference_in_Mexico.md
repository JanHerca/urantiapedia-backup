_By Tamara Strumfeld, executive director, Urantia Foundation, Illinois, United States_

Our adventure began on October 26, when Judy Van Cleave, trustee and secretary of Urantia Foundation, and I flew into Mexico City, 45 minutes from the magical town of San Juan Teotihuacán. Named for its famous and historic pyramids, the ancient city is now a vast Mexican archaeological complex, and the site of two Mesoamerican pyramids built in pre-Columbian America, the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon.

We attended Urantia Association’s regional conference for readers of _El libro de Urantia_. The theme was “The Fifth Revelation in the Twenty-First Century,” and the locale provided a colorful juxtaposition of ancient culture and new revelation. It was delightful to meet so many readers from Mexico as well as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, and the Netherlands.

The presidents of Urantia Association International and Asociación Urantia de Mexico, Enrique Traver and Hector Landin, gave inspiring welcomes. The presenters gave talks that were thoughtful and insightful. Their deep knowledge of the teachings is impressive. I also gave a presentation about Urantia Foundation, its programs, and the progress that has been made in Latin America and around the world since the book was first printed in 1955.

There was a large number of enthusiastic younger people in attendance, and their presence was an inspiration for all of us. They shared their passions, ideas, and hopes for the future. Many have excellent projects in mind, so I encouraged them to apply for Mustard Seed Grants when the time comes.

The entertainment was outstanding, as one would expect in Mexico. We enjoyed the music of a mariachi band on the first night. On the second night the talented Ramiro Ramírez entertained us with his guitar and enchanting voice. Several attendees were brave and sang, including Mariana, Ramiro’s lovely wife, who has an angelic voice. It was wonderful to listen to the many songs of Latin America. Our last night of the conference ended with a fabulous dance party!

Throughout the event there was much love, brotherhood, and camaraderie. What a surprise to encounter an old friend, Rob Davis, who used to work for Urantia Foundation and now resides in Mexico. And with every conference, there is always someone who shows up for the first time after reading alone for years. This time it was Sebastian Balcazar from Bolivia. Sebastian, you were instrumental to Judy and me, acting as our faithful translator. Thank you!

Words cannot express my appreciation and gratitude for everyone involved with the planning of this memorable event. A big thank you goes to the Association of Mexico for sponsoring this conference. Most importantly, I treasure the lifelong memories made with everyone who shared this time together in Teotihuacán. Our stay was short, but the relationships made will be lasting!
