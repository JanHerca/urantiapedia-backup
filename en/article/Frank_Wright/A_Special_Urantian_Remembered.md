“When the more spiritually and cosmically advanced mortals die, they proceed immediately to the mansion worlds; in general this provision operates with those who have had assigned to them personal seraphic guardians.” (<a id="a36_219"></a>[UB 112:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_10))

I promised myself I would not be sad when I went to a recent memorial service, but I could not stop the flow of tears. I try even now not to be sad as I recall the source of that memorial, but I find a place inside of me is now empty and dark. Strange how similar — joy and melancholia. Both bring tears and intense feelings close to the heart. I wonder about the benefit of each. But benefit there must be because each emotion, each sympathetic response, is spontaneous, non-evoked.

Helen Hutchinson died in October. She lived a reasonable long and healthy life. Neither the length nor the health was what distinguished the life of this Urantian from others, however. This was a real person, a cosmic citizen, a personality in reality that left us this year.

She was the most special person I ever knew. She was the most intelligent person I ever associated with. Things she said to you stuck because you knew she was speaking the truth. She discovered _The URANTIA Book_ when a friend told her he knew of a book that had no human author. At nearly 70 years old she was broadminded enough to allow curiosity and her search for truth to overcome the earthly absurdity of that statement — for that statement was not of this earth, but of Urantia. So she sought the book and found truth therein and believed and showed faith.

More than anyone I have ever known she lived what she believed; and she believed _The URANTIA Book_. She started the reading group in her home shortly after finding the book. She told me it was just something she decided to do. She would be there every Thursday if anyone wanted to come, read, discuss. And they did come. Though sometimes she sat by herself, they did come. Though I did not always attend she never failed to ask me to come — and many times I went just because she asked me. I never failed to learn something new, to understand someone or something better, to grow in someway.

She also held special meetings on Sunday mornings. She always fixed food and we would eat and talk and read. After the Urantians left others would come; to hold bible study or singing practice or something. Her house was there for all believers of God. The last time I went on Sunday morning it was just her and me. We ate, read, and discussed life, philosophy, and _The URANTIA Book_. I always came away feeling like something had been added to my being. She seemed to have a purpose to feed the spirit and nurture the soul while directing the life and guiding the action. But it was thought she was best at stimulating, and I guess that is what I miss most.

Ragged and worn, marked and frayed, her book showed the signs of intense interest and research. Study the U-Book she would say — study it! She was a leader, a teacher, and a real person of strength, compassion, conviction and righteousness as she interpreted it, as _The URANTIA Book_ explains it.

She is gone from us for a season, but I cannot remove her from my heart or my mind. I shall not try to remove her. I only hope the day will come when I can remember her, her life and ways, and her great influence ... without being sad.

Goodbye Helen.

Frank Wright, Frankfurt, West Germany
