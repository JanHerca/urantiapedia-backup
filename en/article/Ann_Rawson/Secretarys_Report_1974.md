Due to the serious illness and subsequent death of my dear sister, I was unable to function in any great capacity as Secretary of Urantia Brotherhood this past year.

I have greatly missed the close contact with people and activities at headquarters, but my work has been very efficiently carried on by my good friend, Marian Rowley, and other kind and loyal friends at 533 Diversey, for which I am extremely grateful. This experience has proven to my entire satisfaction that no one of us is indispensable in the work of our Father's kingdom.

Anna Rawson, Secretary

July 28, 1974
