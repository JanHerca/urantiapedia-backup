_By Pato Banton, Mustard Seed Grant recipient, California, United States_

_Editor’s Note: Pato Banton was awarded a Mustard Seed Grant to fund his “Spreading the Good News” tour across California this past April. On behalf of Urantia Foundation, we thank him for his tremendous outreach efforts to creatively spread_ The Urantia Book _and its teachings!_

I’ll start by saying a big THANK YOU to the trustees of Urantia Foundation for approving our application for a Mustard Seed Grant to share “The Good News” and promote _The Urantia Book_ to thousands of people at free concerts during a musical tour across California this April. My partner, Antoinette "Rootsdawtah" Hall, and I had been working on this idea for quite a while, but we lacked the resources to make it happen. With the funds made available through the Mustard Seed Grant, we were able to realize our vision.

Our initial goal was for Antoinette and me to travel with a technical assistant to five cities, doing simple performances that would allow us to reach people through our inspirational music, while also sharing the “Gospel of the Good News.” But when our band heard about the tour, they all wanted to be involved. Thanks to the buzz that was created on social media, other venues and promoters reached out to us, and we ended up doing a total of 14 shows, with 8 of them being free concerts, in Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Bakersfield, Chico, Arcata, Mount Shasta, Los Angeles, and June Lake.

We also sent messages to 42 study group leaders across California, alerting them about the tour and inviting them to join us for a good time. We offered service opportunities during the concerts, at the prayer circles afterward, and at the merchandise booths where inquisitive souls were exposed to _The Urantia Book_ and could ask questions of whoever was attending the merchandise table. It was great to experience fellowship with those who responded, attended, and supported our vision in their own unique and special ways. We are eternally grateful to all of you!

Upon reflection, I can honestly say that the tour was a huge success. We surpassed our own expectations. All of the concerts were well attended, and some were even sold out! (Yes, free tickets go fast!) Most of the shows were family friendly, so parents were able to bring their children for an early show. It was awesome to see the excitement on their faces when we invited the kids to join us on stage.

There was much singing and dancing, big smiles, lots of laughter, tears of joy, warm hugs, high fives, thanksgiving, and prayers. The feedback and loving appreciation that we received from the crowds was overwhelming at times. But we realize that there are a lot of people in this world that just need a little positivity and loving energy in their lives right now.

I’d also like to report that over 30 books were gratefully received from Urantia Foundation, and these were placed in the hands of excited truth seekers!

So again, thanks so much for the love, support, and generosity. God bless you all!
