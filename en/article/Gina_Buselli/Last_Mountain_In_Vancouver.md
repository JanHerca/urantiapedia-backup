My dear friend
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did across an open field in Lake Forest
Where the summer grass grows green and thick
And autumn gives birth to plains of fire
A passageway to the sun
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did through a mountain valley in Snowmass
Where spring breezes skid across the evergreens
And winters play snow white symphonies
A passageway to the stars
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did over the Grand Canyon
Where the sun pierces through fresh skin
And pummels the soul with warmth
A passageway to the sky
Your laughter echoes through my heart like chimes
The way it did through a corridor in Vancouver
Where flowers bloom in cascades
And mountains make a cosmos
Sitting, laughing, steeling our vision
A world we would energize
A universe we would capsize
But now I reach and cannot touch you
I listen and cannot hear you
But I still stand beside you
A misfortune has blunted your heart for some time
And seized your laughter
That echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it will when we meet again somewhere on this Earth
Where your persistence personified will reign
And laughter shall echo like wind chimes
You, our passageway to Paradise
And without your light, a mission much darkened
Far away, I reach to kindle your soul
With the flame you placed in mine
And stand on the brink of the universe, waiting.
Praying for you,

> **Editor's note**: Allison Zopel and Gina Buselli were children when they first met at the 1989 Summer Study Session in Lake Forest. Although they saw each other only at Urantia Book conferences, in the years to follow they formed a lasting friendship. Allison has been making a steady recovery from the effects of a car accident in December of 1999, and this is Gina's tribute to her friend's indomitable spirit.
