<p>The Trinity Teacher Sons
Author: <strong>Ken Glasziou</strong></p>
<p>Who and what are the Trinity Teacher Sons? Well to start with, they are pretty high up in the order of things, belonging to the Order of Daynals, one of three Orders of the Paradise Sons of God. The other two in this Order are the Creator Sons and the Magisterial Sons.</p>
<p>What have they to do with us Urantians? We are informed that they are due to appear on Urantia after its inhabitants have gained comparative deliverance from the shackles of animalism and from the fetters of materialism. Judged by the mini-wars going on in various parts of our planet, that could be many millennia away. But in the meantime, the Teacher Sons do visit our world for the purpose of formulating plans, for their projected sojourn on our planet. When they do come to actually implement those plans they will be accompanied by a Magisterial Son who will have the unpleasant task of passing judgment on who goes where. The Teacher Sons, however, are spared such duties. They will be wholly concerned with the initiation of a spiritual age, the dawn of the era of spiritual realities that will eventually unfold on our planet as on all evolutionary planets.</p>
<p>The Teacher Sons’ role in the order of things is educational and in this they are closely associated with the Melchizedek Teaching Corps. Their joint role is dominantly administrative, the field workers being a corps going under the name of the Celestial Overseers.</p>
<p>Members of the Corps of Celestial Overseers are recruited from a wide ranging set of individuals who have long been connected with the scheme for educating and training  ascending mortals. Our universe of Nebadon has about 3 million of these Celestial Overseers. If these are distributed evenly over the evolutionary planets of which there are upwards of six hundred, then the quota for our planet could be about 500.</p>
<p>However our planet is probably still in quarantine, a probability confirmed by the annual crop of mayhem that spontaneously breaks out in all regions. So it is possible that we have none—but that is a possibility in any case, as it could be that the task of the Celestial Overseers starts on the mansion worlds rather than on the evolutionary planets. That appears to be a distinct possibility as, by and large, it appears that at our level we are pretty much left to ourselves to make our decisions—an essential one being a free will choice (assuming we at least have the beginnings of a “flicker of faith”) to abandon our self-centered, animalistic heritage for a God-centered and selfless career of service to our fellows. Universe policy seems to be that nobody gets pressured into making this choice. And what is education other than a form of pressure designed to induce change?</p>
<p>For the present, the Trinity Teacher Sons concerned with Urantia must surely be occupied in planning for our future. A normal evolutionary world passes through a reasonably orderly set of planetary stages—the pre- and post Planetary Prince Age, then the post-Adamic Age, after which comes the bestowal of a Paradise Son, for most, a Magisterial Son. This is followed by a post-Bestowal Son Age in which the average world is prepared for its status of light and life through the ministry of successive missions of Trinity Teacher Sons.</p>
<p>It is obvious that we Urantians have a long, long path to hoe before we make first entry to the state of Light and Life. But Jesus was never disappointed or discouraged—and he set the pattern for what our attitudes should be. Personally I do not regret having to pass the initial stage of my universe career on a messed up planet like ours. An alternative might have been to start it on a planet already at an advanced Light and Life status. In some ways that could be like being eventuated on Havona—whose inhabitants, we are told, envy us for the experiential career available to us. 'Tis food for decision making.</p>
