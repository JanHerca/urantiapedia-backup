by Marcus J. Borg, Harper Collins, 1989, 1991, pp. 207

“This book attempts in a scholarly and nondogmatic way to say, 'This is what the historical Jesus was like, this is what he taught, and this is what his mission was about.' It seeks, in short, to sketch a portrait of what Jesus was like as a figure of history before his death.” [^1] Huston Smith in commenting on _Jesus, a New Vision_, says, “The book about Jesus I have been waiting for.”

Borg is a professor of religious studies at Oregon State University and the author of several academic studies relating to Jesus. This book is written for a wider readership and has some quite startling research discoveries. Borg announces that the doctrine of the risen Christ who came to die for the sins of the world was an invention of the early church and was never preached by Jesus himself. He believes this popular image of Jesus, still preached in the mainstream churches, is seriously misleading.

> _Borg announces that the doctrine of the risen Christ who came to die for the sins of the world was an invention of the early church and was never preached by Jesus himself. He believes this popular image of Jesus, still preached in the mainstream churches, is seriously misleading._

That this image is inaccurate, Borg says, is a bedrock conclusion arrived at by mainstream New Testament scholarship. “Mainstream biblical scholarship,” he states, “is the approach to Scripture taught in the seminaries of the mainstream churches. It is the product of using a historical method on the books of the New Testament, treating them as human documents rather than as divine documents guaranteed to be infallible by God.” [^2]

The fact that ministers have not passed this scholarly message on to the laity appears to be because they could find no satisfactory substitute for the popular image of the sacrificial Christ who died to pay for our sins. When mainstream clergy do preach about Jesus, Borg says, they tend to emphasize the “kerygma,” the message of the early church about Jesus, and not the message of Jesus himself.

Borg makes no attempt to prove the divinity of Jesus but concentrates on Jesus, the man, and what Jesus believed about God. In doing so, he presents a vision of Jesus that could be acceptable to mainstream Christians and the vast number of people who are searching for spiritual reality. To Jesus, Borg says, reality was ultimately Spirit, a gracious, nurturing, and compassionate God, Creator of all things, by whom and in whom everything exists.

Jesus is described by Borg as a remarkably free person, free from fear and anxious preoccupation, thus able to see clearly and to love. This freedom was grounded in his deep personal relationship with God, from which flowed the other central qualities of his life: courage, insight, joy, and compassion.

Borg says that what we can know about Jesus invites us to see “life in the Spirit” as a striking alternative to the way we typically live our lives. He states that as an epiphany of God, Jesus was a “disclosure” or “revelation” of God. Jesus did not reveal God only in his teaching but in his way of being.

This book contains a multitude of references that indicate a new movement is emerging in the world of religious scholarship that has the potential to turn the Christian world upside down. Its approach is reasonable and rational. The understanding of God it presents is one that carries within itself an automatic correcting mechanism for most of the inconsistencies of conventional Christianity. _Jesus, A New Vision_ underscores the relevancy of a statement on page 2090 of _The Urantia Book_.

“The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!”
