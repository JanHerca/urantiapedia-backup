<p>The Supreme Being</p>
<p>In the Urantia Papers, some authors tend to refer to the Supreme Being as both existent and not yet existent—hence in ways similar to how particle physicists treat particles as simultaneously being both wave and particle.</p>
<p>Although the evolving Supreme Being is yet to complete his existence, and still remains in finite reality in  fragmented forms as God the Supreme, the Almighty Supreme, and the Supreme Mind, nevertheless in the transcendent domains of Paradise, the Supreme Being already “is.”</p>
<p>It is factual that in some Papers a very concise distinction is made between the incomplete Supreme Being and those parts that are now functional during the evolutionary stages of the grand universe. In others, the term “the Supreme” or “the Supreme Being” may be used in such a way as to leave the reader to sort out what is really meant. Another term occasionally used is “Supremacy,” and mostly refers to the joint effects of the Supreme Being and the Paradise Trinity.</p>
<p>For those with some budding interest in philosophy and theology, the concepts expressed in the Urantia Papers on the relationships of finite (immanent) and transcendent Deity have some similarities to current ideas of process philosophy and theology. However in detail and concept, the Urantia Papers appear to be far in advance of any current works.</p>
<p>Even a modest acquaintance with process theology such as is presented in, for example,  Encyclopedia Britannica, can be very helpful for deepening our understanding of the Urantia Papers.</p>
<p>In the Papers, we are informed that the creativity of us humans is limited to the sorting of basic ideas rather than to their creation. Perhaps this confirms what many of our greatest mathematicians have always believed—they do not “create” new theorems or laws but rather “discover” them. Naturally this brings up much argument about where these theorems were prior to their discovery, and also on who created them.</p>
<p>The Papers inform us that all possible original ideas, concepts, etc., are already present as potentials and possibilities in the keeping of the Absolutes of Infinity.  (1261, 1264)</p>
<p>Those that become available to us humans do so apparently because they have already been “processed,” and are present and available in the now functional Supreme Mind. (1287)</p>
<p>Through the cosmic mind of the Infinite Spirit and the Adjutant Mind Spirits of the Universe Mother Spirit, these pre-existent thoughts are presented for our selection, sorting, recombining, and decision making. (1284, 1287)</p>
<p>At least, that is how it seems to be. The charts that follow may be of help for the carrying out of some self-conducted sorting.</p>
