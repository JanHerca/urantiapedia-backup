> "_Religion should not be directly concerned either with the creation of new social orders or with the preservation of old ones_. ([UB 99:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_2))

> Mechanical inventions and the dissemination of knowledge are modifying civilization; certain economic adjustments and social changes are imperative if cultural disaster is to be avoided. This new and oncoming social order will not settle down complacently for a millennium. The human race must become reconciled to a procession of changes, adjustments, and readjustments. Mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed planetary destiny. ([UB 99:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_1))

> Religion must become a forceful influence for moral stability and spiritual progression functioning dynamically in the midst of these ever-changing conditions and never-ending economic adjustments. ([UB 99:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_2))

> Urantia society can never hope to settle down as in past ages. . . . The paramount mission of religion as a social influence is to **stabilize the ideals of mankind** during these dangerous times of transition from one phase of civilization to another, from one level of culture to another. ([UB 99:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_3))

> Religion has no new duties to perform, but it is urgently called upon to function as a wise guide and experienced counselor . . . . ([UB 99:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_4))

> A godless humanitarianism is, humanly speaking, a noble gesture, but true religion is the only power which can lastingly increase the responsiveness of one social group to the needs and sufferings of other groups. ([UB 99:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_5))

> Religion must not become organically involved in the secular work of social reconstruction and economic reorganization. But it must actively keep pace with all these advances in civilization by making clear-cut and vigorous restatements of its moral mandates and spiritual precepts, its progressive philosophy of human living and transcendent survival. ([UB 99:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_6))

> "Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in the present crisis of civilization. ([UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1))

> "Religionists must function in society, in industry, and in politics as individuals, not as groups, parties, or institutions. ( [UB 99:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_3) )

> "Religionists are of no more value in the tasks of social reconstruction than non-religionists except in so far as their religion has conferred upon them enhanced cosmic foresight and endowed them with that superior social wisdom which is born of the sincere desire to love God supremely and to love every man as a brother in the heavenly kingdom. An ideal social order is that in which every man loves his neighbor as he loves himself. ([UB 99:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_4))
