_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Qld._

The previous article by Ernest Moyer on the authorship of _The URANTIA Book_ commented on the significance of consistency for helping to validate the claim of the book to be a divine revelation. After reading Ernest's article, I came across this quotation from Jesus' conference on Mount Gerizim:

> “_The strain of living — the time tension of personality — should be relaxed by the restfulness of worship. The feelings of insecurity arising from the fear of personality isolation in the universe should be antidoted by the faith contemplation of the Father and by the attempted realization of the Supreme._” (<a id="a40_313"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3))

How does one realize the Supreme? I switched on my computer and learned that this phrase occurs just four times in the whole of _The URANTIA Book_. The first quote comes from the Foreword in a paragraph describing experiential-Deity actualization:

> “_The completion of such an experiential unfoldment is designed to afford ultimate service-destiny for all time-space creatures who have attained absonite levels through the completed realization of the Supreme Being and by the ministry of God the Sevenfold._” (<a id="a44_264"></a>[UB 0:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p9_1))

The next is in a paragraph that describes Michael's bestowal experience on Urantia:

> “_After his ascension Michael became master of the experience of Supremacy, the realization of the Supreme; and being the one person in Nebadon possessed of unlimited capacity to experience the reality of the Supreme, he forthwith attained to the status of the sovereignty of supremacy in and to his local universe._” (<a id="a48_321"></a>[UB 101:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_5))

We meet the expression again in a paper on the Thought Adjuster's relation to the individual that describes how our sonship with God is expressed in actions:

> “_But choosing to do the will of God joins spiritual faith to material decisions in personality action and thus supplies a divine and spiritual fulcrum for the more effective functioning of the human and materialleverage of God-hunger. Such a wise co-ordination of material and spiritual forces greatly augments both cosmic realization of the Supreme and morontia comprehension of the Paradise Deities._” (<a id="a52_408"></a>[UB 110:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_17))

It is worth spending a little time studying, in context, the consistency of the concept of the “realization of the Supreme” as given in these four quotations. For me, the example generates an indescribable feeling of love and respect for those who have given us our Fifth Epochal Revelation.
