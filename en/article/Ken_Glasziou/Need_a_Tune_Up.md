What is it we can do to bring to realization the real power of a spiritual life that is perfectly attuned to the will of God for us? Jesus said, “By the old way you seek to suppress, obey, and conform to the rules of living. . . ” ([UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4)) Then he outlined a new way:

- First we must be transformed by the Spirit of Truth.
- We achieve this via a constant spiritual renewing of our minds—resulting in:
- A strengthening of the inner soul so that:
- We are endowed with the power of the certain and joyous performance of the gracious, acceptable, and perfect will of God.

How do we obtain a constant spiritual renewing of our minds? If you are already in unbroken and constant communication with your Thought Adjuster, you do not need the help Jesus offered. If not, one way to doing so is the way the youthful Jesus set about it via what the book calls the “alter ego” method. ([UB 91:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_1))

The young Jesus habitually and continuously informed his heavenly Father about the details, the comings and goings of his daily life—but with no presumption that God would respond in any other way than helping him to feel “right” about himself.

There is probably no better way than this for us Urantians to achieve the necessary “constant spiritual renewing of our minds.” Try it and see.

> We are not put on this earth to see through each other, but to see each Other through.
