The Urantia Papers put this at 85,000 years ago. Clovis was the archaeological site in New Mexico that, in the 1930’s, gave rise to the date of arrival as about 11,000 years ago. Deviation from this date has been hotly opposed to the point of irrationality. Only in the last few years have alternative views been considered, some as late as 40,000 years ago.

Some recent estimates use a mitochondrial DNA clock and go to 78,000 years ago. One curiosity is that man appears to have arrived at the southern tip of South America by 10,000 years ago.

In view of the uncertainties when the Papers were written, why did our hypothetical committee expert hazard the 85,000 years ago guess?.
