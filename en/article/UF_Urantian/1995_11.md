## Softcover Second Printing

In October 1995, 25,000 more copies of the softcover book will be printed. The softcover edition of _The URANTIA Book_ became available in May 1995, and over 5,000 have already been sold. We have received many comments from readers on the high quality and low price of the new book. Its popularity seems to be based on the following:

1. **Size** - It is smaller and two pounds lighter than the big book, making it better for travel and easier to hold.
2. **Durability** - The flexible, vinyl cover, unlike the cover of a paperback book, will bend without creasing. Also, the book's binding is both stitched and glued, making for a strong book that will last for years.
3. **Accessibility** - The softcover book is available through bookstores worldwide, including the two giant bookstore chains, Barnes & Noble and Borders Books.
4. **Readability** - The type of the text is only one-half point size smaller than the type of the larger book. The paper is low-glare, and it is thin yet opaque, preventing transparency. This provides a very readable text.
5. **Affordability** - The softcover book retails for $19.95.

The Trustees of URANTIA Foundation welcome a new Trustee, **Georges Michelson-Dupont**, who was elected by the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of **Hoite C. Caston**.

Hoite has served the URANTIA Movement in various capacities since 1966 and has been a Trustee of URANTIA Foundation since 1986. Hoite served on the Board during an extremely difficult period and helped the Board continue its focus on the long-term goals for the fifth epochal revelation. His unceremonious dedication and courage have been an inspiration to us. We wish him well and look forward to his continued advice and counsel.

**Georges Michelson-Dupont** is a second-generation student of _The URANTIA Book_ who resides in Blennes, France, with his wife Marlène, and their two daughters. Georges has been very active in many aspects of disseminating the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ and its translations. His assistance with the French translation team and with the printing of the French translation helped make the revision of _Le Livre d'Urantia_ possible. Georges publishes a newsletter, has been a member of the Coordinating Committee of the International URANTIA Association, and Georges and Marlène head the URANTIA Foundation office in Paris. Georges is the first Trustee ever to serve from a country outside of the United States, and we look forward to working with him as the Board of Trustees becomes truly international and the Foundation's services continue to expand worldwide.

## Translation Update

The Russian translation team has completed the first draft of the Russian translation and has begun the editing phase. The projected date for publication of the Russian translation is late 1997 or 1998.

The second printing of the Spanish translation, including many corrections, is now available in softcover for $19.95. 

The editing of the Dutch translation continues. 

The first draft of the Korean translation is more than half completed. 

The Swedish and Estonian translations are underway, and translations into German, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese are under consideration. The Foundation is dedicated to providing accurate translations of the highest quality possible.

Because of its size and unique content, translating _The URANTIA Book_ is a long and difficult process that requires considerable financial support. If you wish to contribute to translations, you may give a donation specifically to the Translation Fund. The Foundation now has available several deluxe, leatherbound editions of _The URANTIA Book_. <ins>All profits from their sale will be reserved to fund additional translations</ins>. 

## Corrections To The Text

From time to time, readers have inquired about minor changes which the Foundation has made to the text of the book over the years. _The URANTIA Book_ is now in its twelfth printing. Over the course of these twelve printings, changes have been made to the text in order to correct misspellings, punctuation errors, proofreading errors, and printing imperfections. Almost half of these changes, including fewer than ten that might be considered to be more than minor corrections, were made in the second and third printings. These changes were made by those very individuals who were given the responsibility of preparing the original text for publication.

The Foundation provides, upon request, a list of all the corrections to the text.

## Farewell to William M. Hales (November 13, 1907 - June 25, 1995)

On June 25, 1995, Bill Hales graduated from URANTIA. Bill was one of the five Trustees who created URANTIA Foundation in 1950 and was the Foundation's first President. Being a founding member of the Board of Trustees, Bill had a close relationship with _The URANTIA Book_ and its dissemination to the world, even before its publication. Bill became involved with the URANTIA Papers in the 1920's, and his last official involvement was his post as Trustee Emeritus, which he resigned in 1989. Bill's service to the URANTIA Movement spanned seventy years, including thirty-three years as a Trustee and six years as a Trustee Emeritus.

Bill is survived by his wife, Mary Lou, his children John and Lynn, and his five grandchildren and five great grandchildren. The Hales family has been dedicated for many years to the study and dissemination of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ . In addition to his activities related to _The URANTIA Book_ , he maintained a life-long interest and involvement in civic activities that helped promote the growth of the individual—in mind, body, and spirit. Those who knew Bill agree that he lived a life of loving and unselfish service.

## Competition to Publish The URANTIA Book

In our last issue of “URANTIAN News,” May 1995, we reported on the status of the Foundation's court struggle to retain its ownership of the copyright in _The URANTIA Book_ . We reported that the judge had ruled that the Foundation's 1983 renewal of the copyright was invalid. This ruling has not however been filed, and it is not official until it is filed, after which time the Foundation intends to appeal it. In fact, the appeal process cannot even begin until this order is entered. Notwithstanding the uncertainties regarding the eventual status of the copyright, we have received mailings about readers and groups with no official connection to URANTIA Foundation, who are preparing to publish _The URANTIA Book_ in direct competition, not cooperation, with URANTIA Foundation. One individual has already published Part IV of _The URANTIA Book_ separately under another title. Another group plans to publish the English edition of the book later this year and also plans to translate and publish translations of _The URANTIA Book_ which the Foundation has already published or are nearing completion, namely, the Spanish, Korean, and Russian translations.This cannot be viewed as working together, as cooperation, or even as friendly competition. The Foundation has been in communication with the individuals and groups doing these competitive projects and has, in good faith, attempted to dissuade them, but apparently to no avail.

The Foundation's request to any individual or group which may be interested in printing _The URANTIA Book_ has been simple: Just wait until the copyright case, including the appeals, is finally settled. This request has been ignored, and plans to print the book continue.

We expect that, if any individual or group publishes _The URANTIA Book_ at this early date, it will cause great confusion among thousands of future readers.

## Reader Comments About The URANTIA Book

> “Six years ago I had the pleasure of receiving a copy of _The URANTIA Book_ which contains a wealth of enlightening information and obviously, can be regarded as a meritorious literary work.” ~ _Estado de México, MÉXICO_

> “Distributing URANTIA Books and holding conferences and going on one kind of crusade or another are important ways of furthering our Great Cause. But such activities are only second-best methods of accomplishing the ultimate goal. The best method seems to me is to develop a character so sincere and matchless that people would just naturally ask, ”what is your favorite book?" ~ _Kansas City, Missouri, USA_

> “Having received so much from this book I am anxious to share this marvelous work with others. The solution to most problems lies in the unread pages.” ~ _Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA_

> “URANTIA as the planet needs this information as a thirsting man needs water. . . . The Church has been converted into a political institution which has nothing in common with the role of the true revelation of God to ordinary people. That is why the information from _The URANTIA Book_ becomes vital to ordinary people.” ~ _Vilnius, LITHUANIA_

> “This is an excellent book because it presents in depth (form & content) the mutual relations between the science, philosophy and religion on an universal scale.” ~ _Plovdiv, BULGARIA_

> "I have been appreciating The Book for many years. And I do wish to thank all that are helping to share it with others. ~ _Chonburi, THAILAND_

> “_The URANTIA Book_ enlightens me every day and I am writing to offer my service in spreading the word of God.” ~ _Guairate, ITALY_
