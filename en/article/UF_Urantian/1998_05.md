URANTIA Foundation is pleased to announce the publication of _Het Urantia Boek_, the Dutch translation of _The URANTIA Book_. The translation was begun in the early 1970s by Henry Begemann, a Dutch URANTIA Book reader in The Netherlands, who discovered _The URANTIA Book_ in a bookstore in Amsterdam. After his second reading of the book, Henry decided to translate it so that it could be shared with his fellow countrymen.

Henry made several trips to the Foundation in Chicago and, after some time, he and his wife, Bauk, started a study group. In time they fostered several study groups and made contacts with readers throughout Europe. Members of the study groups assisted with the translation by reviewing Henry's work and suggesting changes.

During the twenty-three years that _The URANTIA Book_ was being translated into Dutch, seven readers served on the translation team, including Henry's daughter, Nienke Begemann-Brugman, who joined the team in 1989.

When Henry passed away in January 1990, about three quarters of the book had been translated. The remaining quarter comprised the more difficult parts such as Papers on Universal Unity, Deity and Reality, and God the Supreme. At that time, Nienke became the chief translator, and with the help of the other dedicated and committed team members, managed to finish the translation.

Nienke told the story of the Dutch translation at a gathering of readers in November at the Dewes Mansion in Chicago, where _Het Urantia Boek_ was presented for the first time. In a moving speech that revealed the difficulties, the joys, the loyalty and commitment, and the satisfaction experienced by all involved in the translation effort, Nienke said, “ _The URANTIA Book_ is a really wonderful teaching tool, and translations are channels of growth both for readers of those translations and for the teams that produce them. We all know that everything in time and space is relative and the Dutch team is certainly very much aware of the relativity of their interpretation. Nevertheless, the work is finished, at least for the time being, and the Foundation Trustees and members of the Dutch translation team are happy to present _Het Urantia Boek_ to the world.”

The Trustees of URANTIA Foundation are pleased to announce the appointment of **Gard Jameson** and **Mo Siegel** to the Board of Trustees.

Mr. Jameson has been a reader of _The URANTIA Book_ for 26 years and is a Certified Public Accountant, financial planner, and internal auditor. Married with two children and living in Las Vegas, Nevada, he is currently a member of the General Council of the Fellowship and serves as the Chair of its Fraternal Relations Committee. He brings with him extensive experience in that he has served as a trustee on several boards of non-profit organizations.

Mr. Siegel has been a reader of _The URANTIA Book_ since 1968 and currently serves as the Vice President of the Fellowship. Married with five children and living in Boulder, Colorado, he is the Chairman of the Board of Celestial Seasonings Tea Company and President of the Jesusonian Foundation. Mr. Siegel also has extensive experience as a trustee on the boards of both profit and non-profit organizations.

In becoming Trustees of URANTIA Foundation, Mr. Siegel and Mr. Jameson will resign their executive positions in the Fellowship and become members of the International URANTIA Association, a worldwide fraternal group formed to assist URANTIA Foundation in disseminating the teachings of The URANTIA Book.

Although the appointment of Mr. Jameson and Mr. Siegel may come as a surprise to many readers, the Trustees, by electing these two gentlemen, are exhibiting their commitment to making their policy of unity among all readers and reader groups a reality.

**Richard Keeler**, President of URANTIA Foundation said, “May we join with our Heavenly Father, with our Creator Son, and with our brothers and sisters-seen and unseen-to participate in patient cooperation and selfless service to our young movement. May we all be so saturated with the love, truth, and goodness of God that all persons coming into contact with us will know from our behavior that we are truth seekers and spiritual explorers, dedicated to the supernal task of doing the will of our Heavenly Father.”

With the appointment of Mr. Siegel and Mr. Jameson to the Board of Trustees, URANTIA Foundation and the International URANTIA Association are making a positive and evolutionary step forward. We are confident that with patient co-operation among reader groups, we can move forward into the twenty-first century, and that together-with respect for one another's knowledge, experience, and opinions-we can be about our Father's business in the spirit of peace, unity, patient cooperation, and selfless service.

## Future Plans

The appointments of Mr. Jameson and Mr. Siegel come at an important time in the history of URANTIA Foundation.

In 1996, a process was begun at the Nashville conference to involve readers in assisting the Foundation Trustees in developing a “strategic plan,” which sets forth goals for the future. Since the 1996 conference, research was conducted in cooperation with several hundred readers from a variety of reader groups to develop the basic themes of the plan's objectives.

In March, July, and November of 1997, readers helped to complete the plan. One of the main objectives of the plan is to effect the gradual and deliberate process of translating the book into many languages. Other objectives relate to making it easier for potential readers worldwide to access _The URANTIA Book_ and related fraternal groups.

A further analysis of the research resulted in a clearer knowledge of reader concerns, namely: the rendering of service to readers who want information and contact with other readers; the protection of the copyright and marks; the perpetual preservation of the original text; the wide distribution of the book; the publication of study aids; and the dissemination of the revelation through attraction rather than invasive promotion.

## Planning

In 1997, several events took place that provided a basis for future growth. Among them was the continuation of the strategic planning that began in 1996. In March and July 1997, the Foundation hosted weekend meetings at which attendees shared their ideas about, and vision for, the future. The notes and recordings taken at this meeting were used to make further changes to the strategic plan. In November 1997, a third meeting took place at which the attendees reviewed the plan and made further refinements. Some three hundred readers have participated in developing the strategic plan.

These planning meetings were not, however, all business. There were also social events, two of which were held at the elegant Dewes Mansion in Chicago. The highlight of the March event was the presentation of the Russian translation. It was a thrill to hear Tamara Solone, who is Russian, read a passage from the Russian translation. She described the translation as being “sparkling, beautiful Russian.” After the dinner, a video was shown in which the story of the Russian translation was told, and a brief history of the Foundation was presented. This video is available from the Foundation. The highlight of the November gathering was the presentation of the Dutch translation. Nienke Begemann-Brugman read a passage from _Het Urantia Boek_ and shared with us the history of, and her thoughts and feelings about, the translation. Nienke was the chief translator of the Dutch translation, which her father, Henry Begemann, started translating in 1975.

**Legal**. On June 10, 1997, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Foundation's ownership of the copyright to be valid and. therefore, in force until the year 2030.

**Board of Trustees and Staff**. Phil Rolnick resigned from the Board of Trustees on December 31, 1996. Kwan Choi replaced him. Kwan is a Professor of Economics at Iowa State University and has read the book more than a dozen times. He adds an Asian perspective to the Board . More changes occurred in December 1997 with the resignations of Trustees Patricia Mundelius and Tom Burns. Pat and Tom will be missed by all who know them, but they leave behind a legacy of wise and pacient growth. We shall also miss staff members Joan and Damian Bondi who resigned in November 1997. The Bondis loyally served URANTIA Foundation for almost 10 years. 

**Jay Peregrine** from San Francisco and **Connie Greene** from Janesville, Wisconsin, are welcome additions to our staff which now consists of the following:

- **Tonia Baney** - Executive Director
- **Jay Peregrine** - Business Manager and Systems Administrator
- **Bob Solone** - Reader Services, Spanish Desk
- **Connie Greene** - Reader Services
- **Kathleen Swadling** - Development Coordinator
- **Sheila Schneider** - Administrative Assistant
- **Sarah Korhonen** - Administrative Assistant
- **Seppo Kanerva** - Chief Translator
- **Steve Baney** - Volunteer (full-time)
- **Trevor Swadling** - Volunteer (full-time)

**IUA - Eight Associations were formed in 1997** Eight Associations were formed in 1997, bringing the total number to twenty-six and the total number of members to over seven hundred. In Canada, Northern Lights URANTIA Association, URANTIA Association of the Cascades, and Association URANTIA du Québec were formed. In South America, URANTIA Association of Colombia and Andes URANTIA Association (Peru) were chartered. In the United States, Kentucky URANTIA Association, New York-Pennsylvania URANTIA Association, and the Spirit of Oklahoma were formed. To the members of these new Associations, we say, “Welcome to the community of the International URANTIA Association.” We hope to see you in Helsinki next summer, if not before.

**Meetings between the Fellowship and the Foundation** In January and October, Trustees met with representatives of the Fellowship. At these meetings, translations, understanding, and co-operation were discussed. At the October meeting, the Trustees agreed to dismiss any claims that the Foundation may have had against the Fellowship in connection with the Fellowship's printing the book. More importantly, at the October meeting, progress was made toward the establishment of cooperative relations between the two groups.

**Conferences** IUA Regional Conferences were held in the United States, Australia, Finland, Spain, Estonia, and France.

This year, August 7 to August 10, IUA's first international conference outside of the United States will be held in Helsinki, Finland. The theme of the conference will be “Facts, Meanings, and Values.” We hope that many of you will attend. Immediately following the conference in Finland, Estonian readers are hosting a conference. Some attendees of the Helsinki conference plan to attend the Estonian conference and make a side trip to St. Petersburg, Russia. Call or write the Foundation for details.

Also this year, National Associations of IUA will be hosting conferences in Calef, France; Brisbane, Australia; and Glen Ivy, California.

**Translations - Sixty by 2030** Sixty by 2030. URANTIA Foundation hosted the 2nd Translators Conference in October in Gonesse, France. Arab, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Korean, Lithuanian, Finnish, Estonian, Swedish, French, German, and Italian reader-translators attended the conference, along with Trustees Tom Burns, Kwan Choi, Georges Michelson-Dupont, and Richard Keeler. With two translations, the Dutch and the Russian, published in 1997, and with thirty-two years before the copyright expires, the Trustees have set a goal to have sixty translations published by 2030.

**Book Fairs** Foundation representatives attended book fairs in London, Madrid, Moscow, Frankfurt, Helsinki, Sydney, Bogota, Guadalajara, Santiago, Singapore, San Francisco, Chicago, and Miami. More than 4,000 books were sold at these trade shows, and new distributors were acquired. In San Francisco, at the American Library Association Conference, 285 librarians from around the world accepted _The URANTIA Book_ as a donation to their libraries. The Foundation's booths at these book fairs are attractive, portable, and frequently visited.

_El libro de URANTIA_ had a banner year at international book fairs. These professional trade shows last from one to three weeks, and each show can generate sales of 1,000 to 1,500 copies of the Spanish translation of _The URANTIA Book_.

**Copyright Permissions** The Trustees announced a new Permission-to-Quote from _The URANTIA Book_ Policy. Briefly, the new policy is the following: You may quote 1,000 words (double what was previously allowed) without requesting permission from the Foundation, as long as you acknowledge that the quoted text is from _The URANTIA Book_. If you want to quote more than 1,000 words, you must request permission and, if granted, place a disclaimer in your work.

**Public Relations** To many readers' surprise and to some readers' disappointment, _The URANTIA Book_ received some media coverage in 1997. Two Colorado newspapers had articles reporting that some book readers want to start a new religion and establish churches. There were also reports on radio and television that there is a connection between _The URANTIA Book_ and space aliens. To avoid misinformation, before the programs were aired, the Foundation sent explanations to the media about the book, its teachings, and the Foundation's policies on the dissemination of the teachings. The media seemed to prefer, however, sensationalism to the Foundation's conservative approach.

**Fundraising** Over $400,000 was contributed to the Foundation in 1997 for translations, repairs to 533, and the General and Perpetual Printing Funds. This amount was matched by an anonymous donor, resulting in contributions of over $800,000. The anonymous donor was so pleased with the results of this year's fundraising efforts that he has volunteered to extend his challenge grant through 1998. We thank all of you who contributed in 1997. The Foundation cannot do its job without you.

**Building Repairs** Renovations are progressing at URANTIA Foundation's building at 533 Diversey, Chicago. The south end of the building, declared unsafe because of deteriorated steel support beams, has been restablized. Most of the wiring and plumbing have been modernized and the roof replaced. The exterior brick work has been professionally cleaned and tuckpointed. There are still some minor repairs that need completion, but all in all the building is in good shape. Come see us, and we shall give you a tour.

**Conclusion**. So there you have it, the news of 1997 in review. Truly, thank you, all of you who have contributed to the Foundation this past year with your time, your love, your donations, and your prayers, We value you as brothers and sisters, and as friends. 

## Urantia Foundation Representatives

URANTIA Foundation wants to keep in touch with readers of _The URANTIA Book_ around the world and to learn about their ideas concerning the dissemination of the teachings of the book. The Trustees and staff have become increasingly conscious of the international nature of our movement. Truly, the Revelation appeals to all peoples of the world. In addition, the Trustees know that in many countries there are dedicated, long time readers willing to devote their time to serving other readers, fostering the revelation, and helping the dissemination of its teachings.

Therefore, the Trustees have established the appointment of URANTIA Foundation Representatives in those countries where no Foundation Office exists. The first Representatives have been appointed and have assumed their duties.

These Representatives, who serve without pay, respond to readers' inquiries and foster study groups. They also attend book fairs and establish ties with the book industry in their country. The representatives, who are required to have read the book, also help differentiate between _The URANTIA Book_ and other so-called sacred texts or materials.

The Trustees see the Representatives as a means to inform readers of Foundation policies and programs and a way to obtain information from other countries. The Representatives are one more step in the internationalization of the fifth epochal revelation.

URANTIA Foundation has appointed representatives in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Holland, Lithuania, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. The Foundation has appointed Seppo Kanerva as the coordinator of these representatives. We intend to appoint additional representatives in Belgium, Canada, the Congo, Korea, and Switzerland.

## The Prison Project

“A URANTIA Book in every prison in the world” is the mission statement of the newly formed Prison Project, an unofficial endeavor sponsored by the Northwest URANTIA Association (NUA). According to Liz Engstrom, the Director of the Prison Project and President of NUA, from its inception in March 1997, the Prison Project has placed copies of _The URANTIA Book_ in every federal prison in the United States. In addition, in eight states books have been placed in every correctional facility-state and federal. More than 260 books were distributed in 1997.

The goal of the Prison Project is to place a book in every correctional facility in the United States by the end of March 1998. The project participants, working in cooperation with URANTIA Foundation, will see that one copy of the book goes to a prison library for every donation received for that purpose. First priority will be given to federal correctional facilities, then state institutions, and then other countries into whose languages the book has been translated.

The Foundation receives a continual stream of requests from prison inmates who have discovered the book and requested gift copies. There are study groups in many prisons and more are forming. We hear from prisoners almost daily that their lives are being changed by the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_.

If you or your group would like to participate in the Prison Project, one book will be placed for every $5 donation ($7 international). Make checks payable to URANTIA Foundation and send them to Liz Engstrom at P.O. Box 5684; Eugene, Oregon 97405; USA. Requests to provide books to specific institutions will be honored.

## Translators' Conference

The Second Translators Conference was held in Paris during the weekend of October 31 through November 2, 1997.

One of the challenges faced by a translator is how to translate words that are unique to _The URANTIA Book_, words such as “Divinington,” “morontia,” and “absonite.” In Chinese, for example, does one translate “Divinington” as perhaps “Sphere of the Divine Ones”? Or does one transliterate it? Transliterate means not to translate it but to take letters from the Chinese characters, for example, and put them together in such a way that, when pronounced, one hears “Dee-vee-ning-tuhn” or something close to it. When an English-speaking person, or a person speaking one of the Latin languages, reads the word “Divinington,” he or she gets a feeling that it refers to a place where divine beings reside. However, the sound “Dee-vee-ning-tuhn” connotes nothing in Russian and may have an unpleasant meaning in Chinese.

To translate or to transliterate? That was one of the major questions at the Translators Conference. In the French, Spanish, Finnish, and Dutch translations, “Divinington” appears exactly as it appears in the English text. That is, it is transliterated. In the Russian translation, however, “Divinington” is translated as “Sphere of Deity.”

Transliteration can present peculiar problems. Take “Coca-Cola” for example. In written Chinese, there are four characters which, if put together in the proper order and pronounced, make the sound “koh-kah koh-lah,” which in Chinese means “bite the wax tadpole.” Understandably, the Chinese were reluctant to imbibe a beverage with such an unpleasant name.

In the 1970s, General Motors introduced a car called the “Nova.” When GM tried to sell the “Nova” in Mexico, it was a flop. Why? Perhaps because “nova” in Spanish means “it won't go” or “it doesn't go.”

From Friday afternoon until Sunday noon, translators from a dozen countries debated the question of whether “to translate” or “to transliterate.” There were two schools of thought on the question: One group of translators held that there should be a “hard and fast rule” that words such as “Divinington” and “absonite” should be transliterated in all languages. The other group of translators maintained that words such as “Divinington” should be transliterated in some languages (especially Indo-European languages) and translated in others. This group thought that the decision to translate or transliterate should be left up to the chief translator of each language.

Since the translators could not reach consensus, the Trustees reaffirmed their rule that the chief translator of each translation team has “the last say.”

> “And so I give you this new commandment: That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another.” <a id="a168_182"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1)

## Reader Comments About The Urantia Book

> “I find it the single-most inspiring and spiritually enlightening book I have ever read. All through my life I have felt there's 'something more' to God and the universe than I have been taught and learned of. I also have always felt a certain kinship with Jesus and through the study of His life, as told in the book, have discovered the roots of my feelings and thoughts.” ~ Washington, U.S.A.

> “After much reading and listening, I find no connection of _The URANTIA Book_ with UFOs. It is regrettable I didn't hear of The URANTIA Book 40 years ago. Do I believe in UFOs? Who cares! Most of today's kids will live 65 years or more. So much for the modern day doomsday prophets. I support your aloofness of the New Age movement.” ~ Massachusetts, U.S.A.

> “For more than 25 years I have searched through Eastern and Western religions and philosophies until I found URANTIA, which synthesizes them all.” ~ Marbella, SPAIN

> “Both my wife and I know that _The URANTIA Book_ is what it claims to be. It is a revelation. It seems that everything I know of God my Father ‘in experience’ is _The URANTIA Book_. There were many concepts that already existed in my mind prior to reading the book and to read them in URANTIA was one of the most thrilling times of my life.” ~ E-mail, NEW ZEALAND
