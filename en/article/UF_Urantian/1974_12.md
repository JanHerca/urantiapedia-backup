## Urantian Research lawsuit

This Fall, as most of you know, it became the obligation of the URANTIA Foundation to initiate a lawsuit against a California corporation known as Urantian Research and three individuals representing that entity. While this is an unfortunate situation, we have been moved by the letters of encouragement and the contributions to this cause which have been steadily flowing in since the news was made public. This support has been very important to us at such a trying time, and we thank you all for these expressions of loyalty. At the present time, we have nothing further to report regarding this legal action, but you will eventually be notified of the outcome.

## Het Urantia Boek - Henry Begemann

On a much brighter note, we received a visit from Mr. Henry Begemann of The Netherlands (November 12-18). Mr. Begemann is a dedicated student of _The Urantia Book_ who wishes to translate the Book into the Dutch language. The Trustees met with Mr. Begemann, both formally, to discuss the possible translation, and socially, to become better acquainted with this very fine Urantian.

## Book Sales

Since 1955, there have been well over 2,000 foreign sales of the English language “URANTIA Book.” About half of these have been Canadian sales and the other 1,000 copies are scattered in over 40 countries and territories throughout the world. 

The total “URANTIA Book” sales for 1974 (estimating December sales) rose approximately 20 percent over 1973 sales. In November, a record 1,254 books were sold. The future is indeed looking bright.

## Mark Kulieke

On November 2nd, the Trustees named Mark Kulieke an Assistant Secretary of the Urantia Foundation. It is expected that Mr. Kulieke will have a long association with the Foundation.

## We have begun

Despite our limited staff and resources and the heavy demands placed upon all at headquarters, every effort is being made properly to lay the foundations for the slow, sure evolutionary spread of the URANTIA message throughout the world into the hearts of all mankind, and the eventual realization of that long sought after goal of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man. This is a task of immense proportions along side of which our seemingly meager efforts may appear to pale into insignificance. Nevertheless, the Word has now been made Book and we are convinced that through unity of ideals and purpose eventually the teachings of Jesus shall obtain in the lives of all mankind. We have begun; the teachings of Jesus will some day prevail.

We thank all of you for your patience, understanding, and encouragement as we all go forward together in presenting the Urantia Revelation to a spiritually hungry world.

The Trustees and staff hope you all have a Happy Holiday Season and extend to you our Best Wishes for the coming year.
