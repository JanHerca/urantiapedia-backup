## Urantia Foundation Welcomes New Trustee - Philip A. Rolnick

The Foundation welcomes a new Trustee, **Philip A. Rolnick Ph.D**., who was elected to the Board on April 17, 1993. Phil is a professor of theology and ethics and has been a student of _The URANTIA Book_ since 1969. He has hosted many study groups over the years and has served in several elected postions in readership organizations. Phil and his wife Jane, who is also a longtime student of _The URANTIA Book,_ have two children. Phil brings an international perspective to the Board, having studied in France and lived in Australia where his daughter was born.

Phil was elected to fill a vacancy on the Board created by the departure of **Martin W. Myers**, who served the Foundation in various capacities since 1971. The Trustees acknowledge Martin's long dedication to _The URANTIA Book_ and wish him well in the future.

The Trustees are pleased to have someone of Phil's experience join them in continuing the work of the URANTIA Foundation.

## Translations, Concordance, and Eleventh Printing of The Urantia Book Available In Early June

In early June, the Spanish and Finnish translations, a Finnish index, an English concordance, and the 11th printing of _The URANTIA Book_ in English will be delivered to the URANTIA Foundation. This constitutes the largest printing ever of _The URANTIA Book._

3,000 copies of the first printing of the Finnish translation, 5,000 copies of the first printing of the Spanish translation, 25,000 copies of the eleventh printing of the English version of _The URANTIA Book,_ 3,000 copies of the first printing of a Finnish index, and 3,000 copies of an exhaustive English concordance: the arithmetic tells the story. We are about to receive and begin the dissemination of 39,000 books.

The Spanish translation, _El libro de URANTIA,_ will be available for a suggested retail price of US $55. _El libro de URANTIA,_ like the English version, will be sold through bookstores.

The Finnish translation, _URANTIA-kirja_ (pronounced keer-yah, accent on the first syllable) may be purchased from bookstores for a suggested retail price of US $90 and the Finnish Index may be purchased for US $80.

The difference in suggested retail price between the Finnish and Spanish translations is due to the fact that the Spanish printing was a larger run and therefore less expensive. In addition, the entire cost of translating and printing _El libro de URANTIA_ was met by the contributions of many readers. In 1984 there was a fund-raising drive and $290,000 was raised for the “Spanish Translation Fund.” No such fund was established for the Finnish translation and index, although the Finnish readers independently raised money to assist with the translation costs of _URANTIA-kirja._ Even so, some of the translation costs and all of the editing, formatting, and printing costs of the Finnish translation and index are coming out of the Foundation's general funds. These “unfunded” costs amount to US $270,000.

Because of the coordinated efforts of the translation teams, scores of contributors, and the URANTIA Foundation, _The URANTIA Book_ will now be more accessible in more parts of the world than ever before.

## The Urantia Book Concordance news

_The URANTIA Book Concordance_ enables the easy location of virtually any of the 1,120,913 words used in the text of _The URANTIA Book._ Not only does the Concordance alphabetically list every word in the text of _The URANTIA Book,_ showing the number of times each word is used, but it also lists almost every word in its immediate context, giving the page and paragraph number for each occurrence.

_The URANTIA Book Concordance_ may be purchased for US $65 from bookstores or, where no bookstore is accessible, from the URANTIA Foundation.

## URANTIA Brotherhood Association

Important revisions to URANTIA Brotherhood Association are being made. Through newsletters, meetings, and focus groups in Australia, Finland, Hawaii, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville and New York, advice from readers has been solicited and received. Analysis of a broad range of viewpoints is nearing completion, and a finalized organizational structure will be presented in an upcoming newsletter.

The Foundation wishes to thank the many individuals who have given their time and energy to this project. An additional thanks is due to everyone for their patience.

## Urantia Foundation Opens Office In Finland - Seppo Niskanen, Seppo Kanerva

Through the coordinated efforts of Finnish readers and the URANTIA Foundation, we are pleased to announce the establishment of an office in Finland. This office will serve readers in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia.

The Finnish office will be managed by **Seppo Niskanen** and **Seppo Kanerva**. The address of the Finnish office is:

> URANTIA Foundation  
> Mannerheimintie 41b A 31  
> 00250 Helsinki  
> Finland

Last year, through the coordinated efforts of Australian readers and the URANTIA Foundation, a Foundation office was opened in Australia. **Trevor and Kathleen Swadling** are the managers of the office, the address of which is:

> URANTIA Foundation  
> 7 Walsh Street  
> North Narrabeen  
> Sydney NSW 2101  
> Australia

As more and more translations are completed, the Foundation's hope is that more offices will be opened. We see the Foundation's role as being that of a facilitator and coordinator, for _“\[t\]hat state is best which coordinates most while governing least”._ <a id="a84_258"></a>[UB 71:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p3_9)

## Update On Translations

With the experience gained from translations already completed, we are now moving forward on several new translations. No one should think, however, that translations can be done overnight. The process of assembling a translation team, doing a translation, and then editing, polishing, formatting, and printing takes about seven to ten years. (For example, the current Finnish translation has been in process for over nine years.)

**Russian** - By maintaining a pace of approximately one Paper per week, the Russian translation team has translated the Foreword, Part I and Part II. The team will have soon translated the first half of the book.

**Dutch** - The Dutch translation team reports that they have completed the translation. Copy-editing has begun as the process continues.

Since there have been no fund-raising campaigns for these new translations, all expenses must be borne by the URANTIA Foundation and its affiliates. The Trustees would welcome any contributions for these and future translations.

**Other Languages** - We are always searching for qualified individuals to translate _The URANTIA Book_ into other languages. Some of our criteria and guidelines for translators are:

1. That they be equally proficient in English and their native language.
2. That they be a part of a team comprised of a chief translator and one, two, or three assistants.
3. That they translate from the English version of _The URANTIA Book._
4. That they shall have read _The URANTIA Book_ several times-six or more would be ideal.
5. That they be aware that a quality translation can take a decade or more to complete.

## Urantia-kirja Index

The Finnish Index will be just like the English Concordance, except that it will not show the words in their context. _The URANTIA Book_ has about 1,100,000 words, while _URANTIA-kirja_ has about 840,000 words. This difference is due to the many compound words in the Finnish language. For example, the phrase “in the twenty-eighth” is written in Finnish by the one word “kahden nessakymmenennessakahdeksannessa,” which is one of the longest words in _URANTIA-kirja._

> “We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. But we know that there dwells within the human mind a fragment of God, and that there sojourns with the human soul the Spirit of Truth; and we further know that these spirit forces conspire to enable material man to grasp the reality of spiritual values and to comprehend the philosophy of universe meanings.” <a id="a108_557"></a>[UB 0:12.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_13)

## Reader Comments About The Urantia Book

My fatherland has suffered under communists' oppression for 4S years .... They were hard times .... After 4S years of atheism many people's soul has grown dark. So we're in great need to have God's grace and much help. That's why I'm very grateful to you for sending me _The URANTIA Book.” ~_ Budapest, HUNGARY

I've become familiar with various incidents, names, words, and stories thru studying over the years, but I've been left in confusion, until coming upon this study. This work is a ”Master Key“ that unlocked the door of my understanding.” Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA
