## The fifth printing

The fifth printing of “The URANTIA Book,” totalling 25,000 copies, is now being distributed. The first new copies were made available in April. This printing contains a new four-page insert in the front cover of the Book. This insert is comprised of a brief welcome message to new readers and information concerning the nature of both URANTIA Foundation and URANTIA Brotherhood. We hope that it will serve as an invitation to readers to contact our headquarters concerning study group activity in their area.

## Leone Sadler

URANTIA Brotherhood Corporation acts as the Foundation's agent for sales of “The URANTIA Book.” From 1955 through 1975, Leone Sadler, acting as a joint custodian of “The URANTIA Book,” gave freely of her time and energy and faith fully performed her duties in this capacity as well as in several other positions in URANTIA Brotherhood. Virtually every URANTIA Book which left headquarters in the first 20 years was processed and shipped by Leone. Leone departed for the mansion worlds early this year. We miss her capable assistance, her cheerful spirit and her good humor. Nevertheless, we can feel heartened to know that she is now experiencing new delights in the mansions of our Father's house.

## Paris tribunal ruling

Concerning international activities, Tom and Carolyn Kendall together with Martin Myers visited Amsterdam and Paris in May where they were joined by Henry Begemann, URANTIA Brotherhood's European Field Representative. The four visited three study groups in France and Holland. They also deliberated on certain matters involving the French translation of “The URANTIA Book.” Last November, in the civil suit between URANTIA Foundation and Jacques Weiss, a Paris tribunal ruled in favor of URANTIA Foundation on copyright, trademark, and related matters. This judgment is now under appeal.

## Copyright and registered marks guidelines

In order to protect the registered mark URANTIA, URANTIA Foundation recently instituted a suit in New York, which suit we are pleased to announce has been settled with the defendant agreeing to discontinue the use of the mark.

Of course, copyright and trademark concerns continue to occupy much of the Trustees' time. Requirements for maintenance of the purity of the text of “The URANTIA Book” and the special meaning of the registered marks include exercising care in our own use of the text of “The URANTIA Book” and the registered marks, as well as the licensed use by URANTIA Brotherhood and its constituent societies. In an effort to simplify matters and save time in the regulation of the copyrighted material and the service marks used in various regional and national URANTIA conferences, the Foundation has begun to devise a fixed set of guidelines related to protection of copyright and registered marks, the following of which can facilitate conference preparations and insure smooth functioning. Two societies have already co-operated in the use of the guidelines as they have so far been finalized. The Trustees hope these guidelines will be helpful to all.

## The real work of the Kingdom

At 533 Diversey, the URANTIA Foundation continues to make changes, adjustments, and re-adjustments to the steady growth and expansion of the URANTIA message throughout the world. Steps for increasing storage and working space are gradually vbeing instituted. As our own small organizational evolution proceeds, and as we learn from experience and onfront new challenges, we must increasingly rely on the patience, support, and good spirit of you all. Day by day your dedication and loving service are manifesting a new era of spiritual enlightenment and dynamism over the face of the planet.

The Trustees very much appreciate your generous financial support. We will need your continued financial assistance as we discharge our multiple responsibilities toward this fifth revelation of truth.

We likewise are most grateful for the co-operation and encouragement offered by so many from such geographically diverse locations. While we are busy here, our activities cannot eclipse the important fact that the real work of the Kingdom is being done by and in the lives of each of you. God bless you all as we continue to go forward together in this thrilling adventure of laying the foundations for a new age of religion on our planet.
