## The International Urantia Association for Readers of The Urantia Book

We are pleased to announce the formation of our reader membership organization, the International URANTIA Association (IUA), for readers of _The URANTlA Book._ IUA is a task-oriented, social and service organization formed by the URANTIA Foundation to foster the in-depth study of _The URANTlA Book_ and the orderly dissemination of its teachings. One of its main tasks is to put readers in touch with one another. IUA will accomplish its tasks of facilitation and coordination by: referring readers to study groups; responding to reader inquiries; sponsoring meetings, seminars and conferences; developing teaching and leadership skills; and publishing newsletters and periodicals.

For some time, the URANTIA Foundation has been considering the advice of readers about a social and service group for readers of _The URANTIA Book._ The Trustees met with readers in Finland, Australia, and several cities in the U.S.A. and received many constructive ideas for the new membership organization, including the suggestion to choose a global, international name for the group. Hence our new title: International URANTIA Association.

The various features of the International URANTIA Association, what it will do as well as what it will not do, what it will be as well as what it will not be, are explained in a brochure which includes the Charter and Bylaws of IUA. Ifyou are interested in being a part of the International URANTIA Association, 'call or write the Foundation office to request a copy of the brochure and an application form.

Through IUA, we invite you to join with us in disseminating the teachings of _The URANTlA Book_ and providing a service ministry and a social interaction for readers. You are invited to be a part of the team now gathering under the Concentric-Circles Symbol.

## Finland: The First National Association of IUA

The International URANTIA Association will truly be an _international_ organization, for IUA's first national Association is in Finland. The Finnish Association, which currently has about 65 active members, has fine prospects for further growth due to therecent publication of _URANTlA-kirja,_ the Finnish translation of _The URANTIA Book._

The Finns have been waiting for the formation of the new international membership organization. At the Annual Meeting of the Finnish URANTIA Society held on June 9, 1990, the Finns declared:

> The Annual Meeting of Finnish URANTIA Society resolves that Finnish URANTIA Society associates itself, immediately and without conditions whatsoever, with the URANTIA Foundation founded URANTIA Brotherhood Association (URANTIA-vel jeskunta -yhdistys).

Since the new membership organization, IUA, is legally defined as “the reader membership arm of URANTIA Brotherhood Association,” the Finns had only to reaffirm their earlier commitment and to indicate their agreement with the principles of the Charter of IUA. On September 30, 1993, Juhani Leino, President of the Finnish Society, issued a statement on behalf of the Governing Board, which resulted in the Finnish Society becoming the first national Association of IUA. The Finnish President sends this greeting:

> The Governing Board of Finnish URANTIA Society wants to bid all readers and students involved in the URANTIA Movement welcome in this new international body, the purpose and objective of which is to foster in-depth study of _The URANTIA Book_ and the dissemination of its teachings on the person-to-person basis on this planet of ours.

## IUA Gets Underway In U.S.A.

From August 20 to August 22,1993, interested readers from Hawaii to Finland met in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Trustees of URANTIA Foundation in order to inaugurate the International URANTIA Association. Since then, the majority of those attending the meeting have applied for membership, and many are actively working in their local areas to form Associations of IUA. In addition to examining the Charter and Bylaws of IUA, the attendees at the Nashville meeting examined administrative techniques as they are discussed in _The URANTIA Book;_ heard a provocative talk by Dr. Jeffrey Wattles on types of epochal revelation; participated in a Remembrance Supper; and listened to some moving musical moments by Sheila Miller and Bob Solone. Old friendships were renewed; new friendships were begun. Great things often happen when readers of _The URANTIA Book_ get together, and bringing readers together is one of the purposes of IUA.

## Hawaii And New York To Form Associations-Others In Process

Hawaiian readers of _The URANTIA Book_ will be celebrating the formation of an Association of IUA from Friday, November 5, to Sunday, November 7,1993. In New York, readers will be forming an Association on the first weekend of December, 1993.

Other Associations are currently being formed in California and some southern states of the U.S.A. Efforts are also underway in Australia, England, and elsewhere. A minimum of ten members is required for a local Association, 30 members for a national Association. Contact the Foundation office if you are interested in joining or starting an Association in your area.

## Coordinating Committee of IUA

The Coordinating Committee (CC), a small group of readers appointed by the Trustees of URANTIA Foundation, will work to facilitate the formation and chartering of Associations. Initially, CC members will serve for one year terms. Coordinating Committee members presently include: Tonia Baney of Hawaii, Chair; John Ploetz of San Diego; Catherine Jones of Arizona; and Eddie King of Nashville.

## IUA's First International Conference July 1994

From Friday, July 8, to Tuesday, July 12, 1994, the International URANTIA Association will hold its first international conference. The conference will be held on the beautiful campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Jo Anne Nelson of Nashville, is the coordinator of the conference. Registration information and conference theme will be issued in a later mailing. If you have questions, send them to Jo Anne Nelson in care of our Chicago office. 

## Foundation Opens Office In England - Christopher and Tina Moseley

The URANTIA Foundation has opened an office in England in order to serve readers in the United Kingdom. The managers of the office are **Christopher and Tina Moseley**, who will be working closely with bookstores to make sure that they have a ready supply of _The URANTIA Book._ Chris is originally from Australia and Tina is from Finland. They both work for the British Broadcasting Corporation and have hosted a study group for many years.

~~The address of the office is:~~ This office has since been closed. We thank Chris and Tina for their years of service.

## Channeling

Within certain circles of people reading _The URANTIA Book,_ there has developed over the last couple years a phenomenon which has been labeled “channeling” or “The Teaching Mission.” Advocates of this phenomenon claim to be in touch with superhuman personalities, who sometimes have names taken from _The URANTIA Book._

First, it must be said that, whenever possible, the URANTIA Foundation avoids commenting upon anyone's personal religious experience. However, if the claims of an individual or group begin to disrupt or supplant the study of _The URANTIA Book,_ while claiming to represent the “true” message of _The URANTIA Book's_ teachings, then our responsibility is to differentiate our organization and its affiliated groups from groups which depart from the study of _The URANTIA Book._

We believe that the present claims of “channeling” have diverted groups from the in-depth study of _The URANTIA Book_ to the “short-cut” of seeking contact with spirit beings through voices or trancelike states. Some people have made claims that a “continuation” of _The URANTIA Book_ is being “channeled.” Hints of apocalyptic warnings are also being issued. Historically such warnings are common to these kinds of phenomena.

We recognize and respect the right of all people to make up their own mind about religious issues. However, we think it is our duty to inform those on our mailing list that “channeling” has nothing to do with the URANTIA Foundation, and that “channelers” and members of “The Teaching Mission” are not knowingly accepted as members of the International URANTIA Association. An important task of IVA is referring readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to other readers or to study groups. We cannot in good faith refer readers, especially new readers, to groups or individuals who are practicing “channeling”.

The URANTIA Foundation has taken great care over the years to insure that _The URANTIA Book_ is not publicly identified with cultic, psychic, or occult groups and phenomena. Our intention is to let the beauty of _The URANTIA Book's_ teachings be unencumbered by public alliance with either New Age religions on the one hand or traditional religions on the other.

_The URANTIA Book_ teaches:

> _Altogether too much of the uprush of the memories of the unconscious levels of the human mind has been mistaken for divine revelations and spirit leadings._ <a id="a95_160"></a>[UB 100:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_7)

> _Under no circumstances should the trancelike state of visionary consciousness be cultivated as a religious experience._ <a id="a97_123"></a>[UB 100:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_8)

> _The secret of \[Jesus'\] unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of God; and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship—unbroken communion with God—and not by leadings, voices, visions, or extraordinary religious practices._ <a id="a99_269"></a>[UB 196:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_10)


## Hail and Farewell - James Carleton Mills, PH.D. (March 8, 1908 -July 29, 1993)

Jim Mills had an inspiring history of service from the early days of the URANTIA movement. He was a member of the Forum from 1951 to 1955. He served as a committee member, General Councilor, Vice-President, and President of the URANTIA Brotherhood. And he served the URANTIA Foundation as a Trustee, a member of the ACT Committee, and as Trustee Emeritus.

After graduating from Albion College in 1931 and marrying Eunice M. Foster in 1933, he became a successful businessman, pursuing a career as sales engineer for a large industry. In his later years, Jim retired from industry, re-entered school, and achieved a life-long dream when, at the age of 77, he received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Florida State University. Jim completed his work career as a professor of ethics.

Jim did not begin life with a tail wind. He had to face and surmount his share of challenges and difficulties. What emerged was a man of exceptional grace and wisdom, whose spiritual fragrance and clear insight inspired and influenced readers of _The URANTIA Book_ for decades. To many of us, Jim Mills was a trusted counselor, a remarkable teacher, and a beloved older brother.

Intellectually, Jim was logical and tough, but personally, he was gentle. During several periods of turmoil in our history, he never failed to maintain his equilibrium and purpose. By so doing, he steadied many who may have otherwise wavered. With diplomacy, skill, and characteristic wit, Jim addressed the issues of the hour without forgetting the vision of eternity. He was a trusted leader and a wonderful friend .

Quietly, but consistently, Jim was present to offer his counsel when requested. So many people, from the newest reader to the most experienced, have so many times benefited from his teaching, counsel, and fatherly devotion that it is difficult to describe his life in just a few words. Perhaps the following snapshot will convey something of his nature.

On the day before his death, Jim lay in a hospital bed, obviously experiencing considerable discomfort. But to visitors who had come from out of town, his first words were “Where are you staying?” Since both Jim and Eunice were in the hospital, he appeared to have been concerned about his visitors' lodging and comfort. After a short time, the visitors left. His last words were, “Have a safe trip home.” We wish the same for him.
