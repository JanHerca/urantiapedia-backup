## Foundation Wins Copyright Appeal

On June 10, 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that URANTIA Foundation's renewal copyright in _The Urantia Book_ is valid and will remain in force until 2030. This ruling reverses the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona which had ruled on February 15, 1995, that URANTIA Foundation's 1983 renewal of the copyright was invalid. The appellate court found the ruling of the lower court to be flawed on several points of law; it declared that the copyright had been infringed; and it directed that the case be “remanded \[to the district court from whence it came\] for further proceedings on damages.”

Kristen Maaherra, the Foundation's opponent in the case, made a request to the Appellate Court that the case be reheard by Judge Urbom in the US District Court of Arizona. The request was denied. She has until November 11 to appeal the June 10 ruling.

While this decision strengthens the Foundation's ownership of the copyright, the Trustees desire to avoid litigation whenever possible. We pray that readers will work together in their efforts to disseminate the teachings of the fifth epochal revelation to all the people of the world.

Judge Schroeder, one of the three appellate judges, made the following 15 points in her Summary of the Opinion:

> _\[1\] The copyright laws do not expressly require “human” authorship. It is not the creations of divine beings that the copyright laws were intended to protect. In this case, some element of human creativity must have occurred for the Book to be copyrightable._
> 
> _\[2\] The Book was copyrightable if copyrightability was claimed by the first human being who compiled, selected, coordinated, and arranged the Urantia teachings in a way that the resulting work as a whole constituted an original work of authorship. Those who were responsible for the creation of the tangible literary form that could be read by others could have claimed copyright as authors because they were responsible for the revelations appearing in a way that rendered the work original as a whole._
> 
> _\[3\] The Contact Commission may have received guidance from celestial beings when it formulated the questions asked. The questions contributed materially to the structure of the Papers, to the arrangement of the revelations in each Paper, and to the organization and order in which the Papers followed one another. The human selection and arrangement of the revelations could not have been so mechanical or routine as to require no creativity whatsoever. The extremely low threshold level of creativity required for copyright protection was met._
> 
> _\[4\] The claim of infringement concerned the verbatim copying of the entire Book, including the selection and arrangement of the revelations into the Papers that comprised the Book. This case did not concern the use of a single “revelation” outside the context of the Book, which would have been analogous to a “fact,” and would not have been copyrightable._
> 
> _\[5\] The Papers were works amenable to common-law copyright protection._
> 
> _\[6\] Under the 1909 Copyright Act, an unpublished work was protected from the moment it was created until it was published with notice or otherwise received protection under federal copyright law. The Papers were therefore protected from the moment they were created by the members of the Contact Commission until publication of the Book. The question was whether those humans transferred the copyright to the Foundation._
> 
> _\[7\] The members of the Contact Commission demonstrated their intent to transfer the common-law copyright in the papers through the language of the trust instrument and delivery of the printing plates to the Foundation. Under the 1909 Act, a common-law copyright could be assigned without observing formalities. Mere possession of the printing plates may have been sufficient to establish an assignment as against a third party, particularly when interested parties had acquiesced in the putative assignee's ownership. Because the intent to transfer ownership was clear and the plates were delivered to the Foundation, the members of the Contact Commission transferred their copyright in the Papers to the Foundation. When the Foundation published the Book, the original statutory copyright automatically vested._
> 
> _\[8\] Maaherra was probably correct that the Book was not a “work made for hire.” An employment or commissioning relationship at the time the work is created is a condition for claiming renewal as the proprietor of a “work made for hire.”_
> 
> _\[9\] The general term “proprietor” was probably sufficient to identify the legal basis of the renewal claim in 1983._
> 
> _\[10\] No case has held a renewal invalid for lack of an adequate description of the basis of the claim._
> 
> _\[11\] The requirement of accurate identification of the renewal claimant has not been rigidly enforced._
> 
> _\[12\] Even if the Foundation could no longer correct the “work made for hire” description of its proprietorship claim on the renewal form, the renewal copyright was not invalid._
> 
> _\[13\] Inadvertent mistakes on registration certificates do not invalidate a copyright unless the alleged infringer has relied to its detriment on the mistake, or the claimant intended to defraud the Copyright Office._
> 
> _\[14\] The Foundation deposited two copies of the Book with the Copyright Office. The Book clearly described its origin. There was no fraud on the Foundation's part and no prejudicial reliance by Maaherra._
> 
> _\[15\] The renewal copyright was valid and Maaherra infringed it._

We are pleased to announce that **Kwan Choi**, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, was appointed Trustee of URANTIA Foundation in March 1997. Kwan replaces **Philip Rolnick** who resigned from the Board last year. Kwan and his wife Kathy moved from Korea to the United States in 1972. They have three boys, aged 13, 18, and 20, two of whom are readers. Kwan and Kathy have been students of _The URANTIA Book_ for over 20 years. Kwan is the editor of two economic journals. Kwan says, “I try to practice the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ in my profession. When selecting articles for publication, I, with the help of colleagues, try to eliminate all kinds of bias and discrimination.”

In these times of internationalization of the Urantia movement, Kwan, as an Asian and an economist, adds another element of diversity to the Board.

## Translations And Bringing Translators Together

URANTIA Foundation continues its commitment to ensuring that _The URANTIA Book_ is translated into all the major languages of the world, and that distribution channels for all translations in the appropriate countries are found. An active program for identifying prospective translators continues. In addition, translations often appear spontaneously from an individual who has been working on his or her translation for years. It is the Foundation's intent to encourage and support as much as possible the many translation efforts. Published translations: French, Finnish, Spanish and Russian. Translations soon to be published: Dutch, Korean, and Swedish. Translations in progress: German, Estonian, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, and Lithuanian. Translations in preliminary stages: Chinese, Hindi.

The Second Translators Conference will be held in Paris October 29 to November 2. Current and prospective translators from all over the world will come together to share experiences, discuss the difficulties associated with translating such a The Second Translators Conference will be held in Paris October 29 to November 2. Current and prospective translators from all over the world will come together to share experiences, discuss the difficulties associated with translating such a complex text as _The URANTIA Book_, and plan future translation projects. complex text as _The URANTIA Book_, and plan future translation projects. URANTIA Foundation has established an Internet discussion group for translators of _The URANTIA Book_. This allows translators to share thoughts and experiences and generally to “talk shop” on a daily basis.

Also, a dictionary of difficult terms and concepts is being created to assist translators and to maintain a consistency between translations. 

> “13. *Effective and wise leadership.* In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective load-pulling spirit. Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together—all at the same moment. And such teamwork—social co-operation—is dependent on leadership.” <a id="a99_318"></a>[UB 81:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_37)

## Five New Associations of IUA

1997 has seen the formation of five new associations of IUA - three in Canada, one in Colombia, and one in Peru. The associations in Colombia and Peru are the first to form in South America.

### CANADA

**Northern Light URANTIA Association of Canada**

On Sunday, January 26th, 1997, Cathy Jones, Chair of the Coordinating Committee, and Trustee Pat Mundelius welcomed members of the first local Association of IUA in Canada and spoke about the goals of the Foundation and IUA. The Licensing Agreement was signed and the following officers were appointed: Brian King, President; Ken McMullen, Vice President; Lynn King, Secretary; and Ernie Vegh, Treasurer.

The licensing ceremony was a joyful start to this new Association, and we look forward to a long relationship of service with the Northern Light.

**URANTIA Association of the Cascades**

On Sunday, June 1st, 1997, the second Canadian local Association, the URANTIA Association of the Cascades, was licensed. Pat Mundelius and Cathy Jones assisted. It was a wonderful weekend spent at “Bowen Lodge by the Sea,” West Vancouver. Warm friendships were established and the following officers were appointed: Nathen Jansen, President; Ronald Louie, Vice President; Kasandra Jansen, Secretary; and Ferne Louie, Treasurer.

**Association URANTIA du Québec**

The air was filled with excitement in Montreal on July 20th at the home of Louis Laporte, as a group of dedicated readers of _Le Livre d'Urantia_ gathered to license the third local Association of IUA in Canada, Association URANTIA du QuJbec. Sixty-six applications were received, with 33 Charter Members present. Cathy Jones and Trustee Georges Michelson-Dupont also attended.

This was the first time that many of these readers had met one another. There is so much interest that plans are already underway to divide into three separate associations. A business meeting followed the licensing and the following officers were elected: Louis Laporte, President; Ronald Grondin, Vice President; Carmen Desrosiers, Secretary; and Lise & Pierre Routhier, Treasurer.

### COLOMBIA

**URANTIA Association of Colombia**

Colombian readers, with the help of organizers Dale Hall and Ramón OrtRz, both 20 year readers of _The URANTIA Book_ and Colombia's longest and staunchest Foundation supporters, inaugurated a new IUA Association on Sunday, May 4, 1997. The Foundation's Executive Director, Tonia Baney, who was in Colombia attending our first Colombian Book Fair, assisted in the inauguration. It is the first South American IUA Association and promises to be a beacon of light for URANTIA related activities for all of South America. Office bearers for the new association are: Ramón Jacobo Ortíz, President; Hermman Noreña, Vice President; Uriela Pelaez, Secretary; and Jose Leonidas Bonilla, Treasurer.

### PERU

**Andes URANTIA Association**

On August 17, 1997, Trustees Richard Keeler and Georges Michelson-Dupont, George's wife Marlene, and staff member Bob Solone arrived in Arequipa, Peru. They were met at the airport by three carloads of enthusiastic readers. During the next 24 hours, the Peruvians revealed their desires, plans, and preparations to create an IUA Association.

On August 18, the Andes URANTIA Association was chartered, the Licensing Agreement was signed, and 32 readers became new members of IUA. The following officers were appointed: Alfonso Luque, President; Regis Llerena, Vice President; Miriam Bustamente Bedoya, Secretary; and Maria Meza Urquizo, Treasurer.

In addition, committees were formed with the following committee chairpersons: Alejandro Ranilla Collado, Conference Committee; Olga Luque Vásquez, Membership Committee; Beatriz Arispe Valderrama, Education Committee; and Juan Mayta Coaguila, Publications Committee.

> “5. *Spiritual insight.* The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. Mutual understanding and fraternal love are transcendent civilizers and mighty factors in the world-wide realization of the brotherhood of man.” <a id="a137_643"></a>[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7)

## Foundation Increases Attendance at Trade Shows and Book Fairs

1997 has been a year for book fairs as the Foundation increases its contacts in the book trade worldwide. The Foundation's display booths are attractive, appealing, and professional. In addition, they are lightweight and portable, making it easy to ship them, as we do, to book fairs all over the world.

**LONDON**. Chris and Tina Moseley, who run the Foundation's office in Britain, set up and manned a Foundation display booth at the International London Bookfair in March and made contacts with many booksellers.

**BOGOTA**. Tonia Baney and Bob Solone from the Foundation staff in Chicago, and Rosendo and Maria de Aguilera from the Greater New York URANTIA Association attended the 10th International Book Fair of Colombia, South America. This was the first time the Foundation displayed a booth in Colombia. The trip was a phenomenal success.

Over 1,000 books were sold at the fair. New distributors were acquired, and long-standing relationships with booksellers and distributors in Central and South America were solidified.

The Foundation's booth was crowded with visitors during the entire fair. Thanks to the many Colombian readers volunteering their time at the booth, we were able efficiently to serve and answer the questions of visitors. Hundreds of names were added to the Foundation's mailing list.

<img src="/image/article/UF_Urantian/1997_BookExpo_America_300.jpg">
<figcaption><em>Urantia Foundation at BookExpo America</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**CHICAGO**. The annual book industry gathering, BookExpo America, formerly known as the American Booksellers Association Convention and Trade Exhibit, was held in Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center. Over 1500 exhibitors, representing publishers of every size and specialty, attended this book fair.

With copies of the book and information packets in hand, the Foundation staff and several dedicated volunteers made many valuable contacts with distributors, booksellers and international trade and publishing organizations.

**LIBRARY BOOK FAIR - San Francisco**. In June, the American Library Association held a conference / book fair in San Francisco. This was the first time the Foundation attended an American Library Association Conference. Our thanks to the volunteers who manned the booth.

We offered free books to libraries. All together 161 URANTIA Books and 124 Concordances were requested. While the majority of requesting libraries were from North America, contacts were also made from other nations including the University of the Philippines, the University of Singapore, the University of Santiago in Chile, the University of Guam, and the Republic of China.

**AUSTRALIA**: The Australian Book Fair was held on August 2 to 4 at Darling Harbor situated in the heart of Sydney. Unlike previous years, when the book fair was open to the public, this year's event was held exclusively for the book trade.

Many people in the trade stopped to visit and took brochures about the book. Representatives from two different electronic bookstores visited the booth. _The URANTIA Book_ is now available from mainstream electronic bookstores on the Internet. Again, we thank the volunteers who helped us at the booth.

The Foundation also had display booths this year at book fairs in Madrid, Frankfurt, Moscow, and Miami. We are always interested in any help with the manning of booths for book fairs - especially in the non-English speaking countries. If you are interested in assisting with book fairs and speak other languages, please contact Steve Baney or Trevor Swadling at the Foundation office in Chicago.

## Channeling and The Urantia Book? The South American Question

In past issues of URANTIAN News, the Foundation has made disclaimer statements on the phenomenon known as “channeling” (See URANTIAN News, November 1993). The Foundation continues to receive occasional inquiries from concerned readers who want to know if there is any connection between the Foundation and claims of “channeling” and related material that includes concepts, names of personalities, and other identifiable information from _The URANTIA Book_.

Until recently, most inquiries from readers have been about several “channeling” groups in the USA, such as “The Teaching Mission” and “Gabriel of Sedona,” both of which claim to have “channeled” a continuation of the fifth epochal revelation.

However, on a recent trip to South America, Trustees and staff visited study groups in ten cities in seven countries, and many readers in several countries asked if the Foundation was connected with a group called “Hermandad YO SOY” (the I AM Brotherhood). This group is based on “channeled” writings that are influencing groups of URANTIA Book readers throughout Central and South America. Some of the written material is entitled Annex of the fifth epochal revelation and contains terms like Grandfanda, Morontia, Hanavard, Lanaforge, etc., words that are unique to _The URANTIA Book_.

After reviewing these writings, we can see that it would be easy for new readers to be confused. Because these writings incorporate so many names from _The URANTIA Book_, many new readers believe it is the continuation of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_.

Also in these writings, phrases familiar to URANTIA Book readers, such as “Order of Melchizedek,” “Global Government of Humanity,” “Truth, Goodness, and Beauty,” etc., are mixed with new-age, astrology, reincarnation, and occult or esoteric terminology. Essentially, the authors use phrases, terms, and names from _The URANTIA Book_ for credibility and to reinforce their authority on their believers.

These writings are easier to read but very different from _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings. If it is misconstrued that they are officially connected in some way with _The URANTIA Book_ or the Foundation, there is a danger of dilution and confusion of the fifth epochal revelation.

While URANTIA Foundation neither endorses, promotes, nor denies any individual's personal experiences, we must assure readers that the Foundation has no connection with any of this so-called “channeled” material about which each individual will have to make up his or her own mind. Even so, the Trustees want to make the Foundation's position very clear: URANTIA Foundation disavows such material as having anything to do with _The URANTIA Book_ or URANTIA Foundation.

## Copyright Review Committee

Since the validity of its copyright of _The URANTIA Book_ has been confirmed, the URANTIA Foundation has had an increased volume of requests for copyright permission to use material from _The URANTIA Book_. In order effectively and efficiently to review these requests, the Trustees have established a Copyright Review Committee.

The members of this Committee are long-time readers of _The URANTIA Book_. Two of them, without knowing the identity of the other evaluator, will review a given work and make recommendations to the Trustees. Our main concern is that the use of material from _The URANTIA Book_ does not misrepresent the teachings of the book.

## Former Trustee, Kenton E. Stephens, Sr.

Dr. Kenton E. Stephens, Sr. of Billerica, Massachusetts “graduated” on August 25, 1997. Kenton and his parents, Grace Kulieke Stephens and Edgar T. (Steve) Stephens, were long-time readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

Kenton was a Trustee of URANTIA Foundation from 1964 to 1975. He believed strongly in the protection of the text of _The URANTIA Book_, as charged in the Declaration of Trust, and was instrumental in the safeguarding of _The URANTIA Book_ intact for many future generations.

Kenton is survived by his wife Claire, three children, seven grandchildren, and three sisters.

## Helen Carlson and Marian Rowley

Helen Carlson “graduated” on January 1, 1997, at the age of 91. In 1935, Helen began her study and association with the URANTIA Papers when she became a member of the “Forum,” the group that studied the URANTIA Papers before they were published. Since then, she served in many capacities with the Foundation and the URANTIA Brotherhood.

Marian Rowley “graduated” on July 14, 1997, at the age of 95. Marian was a student of the URANTIA Papers since 1939 when she became a member of the “Forum.” For 50 years, Marian served in various capacities including 23 years as a full-time, unpaid worker for the URANTIA Brotherhood. Both Helen and Marian were charter members of First URANTIA Society. They devoted their lives to _The URANTIA Book_ and URANTIA organizations.

## A Call for Assistance - Study Group Referrals

Dear Friend: 

As you may be aware, one of the duties entrusted to URANTIA Foundation is to disseminate the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ to the world. It was also asked to bring into existence thousands of study groups of _The URANTIA Book_. Over the years URANTIA Foundation has formed organizations and sponsored conferences and newsletters to achieve this aim. We know that for this to happen, able and willing readers of _The URANTIA Book_ need to participate in order for study groups to be formed and to continue. 

With the steady growth of the International URANTIA Association, and with more translations available and others in the process of completion, we have many readers calling our worldwide offices asking for contact with other readers. We in the office are told many times by readers that they have no one to talk to about the book and that they long to discuss the book with others. We would like you to help us improve our study group network in order to develop more study groups and to give readers up-to-date contact information.

In an effort to update and expand our data base information we would like to ask you the following questions:
1. Do you currently host a URANTIA Book study group?
2. Would you like to host a URANTIA Book study group?
3. If you answer “yes” to either of the previous questions, would you like to have URANTIA Foundation refer interested readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to you and your group?
4. 
If so, please fill out the enclosed questionnaire and return it to us. By doing this you will provide a valuable service to fellow readers of _The URANTIA Book_ who are seeking fraternization. “_Let the greatest among you be the server of all._” <a id="a264_246"></a>[[UB 56:10.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_14)]

International URANTIA Association, a reader membership organization, was established to assist in the dissemination of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. Much of this liaison work of referring readers to study groups is done by URANTIA Associations worldwide working in coordination with URANTIA Foundation offices. (If you would like more information about membership to IUA, see the back of the questionnaire form enclosed.)

URANTIA Book study groups provide an opportunity for readers to work as a team to understand and share the meanings of the book with one another. There are now many readers who have a minimum of twenty years - and many thirty years or more - of reading and studying _The URANTIA Book_. This is a vast well of experience for new and old readers to draw upon and learn. The fraternization between readers in a study group is a learning and satisfying experience.

We are most appreciative of your cooperation in assisting us to be more efficient in providing a referral service to your fellow readers. Our thanks to you in advance.

Sincerely,

Damian Bondi
Director of Reader Services

Kathleen Swadling
Development Coordinator

> “I am twenty-five years old this year and have, so far been having an amazing year of discovery and personal triumph of a spiritual nature. It seems fitting that this year should have me stumble across _The URANTIA Book_. I have spent only a few days entrenched in its pages.” ~ _CANADA_

> “The other day I purchased an incredible book y'all published. Needless to say it is overwhelming, yet not all of it is new to me. Some of it is quite satisfying to my soul, meaning it resonates.” ~ _UNITED STATES_

> “It is the most enlightening book I have read in my life (and I've only read two-thirds of it-the back two-thirds), and I am going to continue to study it, and seek whatever quality amplifying material I can find.” ~ _E-MAIL_

> “Your Russian translators, having spent their years for this excellent work, didn't waste your time and money. For the very few exceptions (I'll write these remarks separately), they did a brilliant work, indeed. Please take my righteous greetings! It is extremely pleasant to have such a well-translated version, for any Russian reader. ” ~ _UKRAINE_
