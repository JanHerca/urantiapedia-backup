We may always have a diversity of intellectual comprehension and interpretation, even varying degrees of socialization. — P K

Human nature is what it is, and individuals are seeking recognition until they gain spiritual maturity and freedom. To serve is paramount. — Y C

I pray for more effort in achieving unity, forgiveness, understanding, love and whatever is required for all involved to be mature and wise in our relationships. — G T

Our words and actions today affect the soil for future generations. We do not need to know what will be planted; we do not need to know when the harvest will come; we just have to be willing to work today, with our sisters and brothers from around the world. — M Z

Dans l'Esprit de Vérité!!! FRATERNELLEMENT!!! (In the Spirit of TRUTH!!! FRATERNALLY!!!) — M C

Nous visons tous le même objectif: faire connaître au monde ce nouvel évangile d'amour et d'espoir. (We are all aiming for the same goal: to bring this new gospel of love and hope to the world.) — G V

Estoy conociendo al Padre realmente, y por Fe, igualmente espero que los hombres, todos, estemos dispuestos a llevar a cabo la voluntad del Padre, y amarnos como él nos ama, apostar con todo a la supervivencia del alma y ser excelentes finalistas. (I am really knowing the Father, and by Faith, I also hope that men, all of us, are willing to carry out the will of the Father, and love each other as he loves us. Bet with everything on the survival of the soul and be excellent finalists.) — I M
