While teaching law in London in 1982, I learned that the Vicar of a nearby Anglican church was a “closet reader” of _The Urantia Book_. He was reluctant to see me in his church office or rectory, so we agreed to meet in a convenient neighborhood pub. I explained to him that I was attracted to the book because over 98% of its quotations were from the Bible, the Apocrypha and the Pseudepigrapha. As an adult Bible class teacher and certified lay speaker, I wanted to know what both the Bible and _The Urantia Book_ said about a text or concept before I used it. The margins of my _Urantia Book_ contained all the Bible references I could find for each quotation and concept, and I could go from _The Urantia Book_ to the Bible with ease; but without marginal notes in a Bible referring to the page and line of relevant passages in _The Urantia Book_, it was impossible to go from the Bible to _The Urantia Book_ using this same technique. Therefore, I used a computer program to rearrange my marginal notes into a format which facilitated going in either direction. I showed him the latest printout of this material which I brought to England for my own personal use.

The Vicar expressed interest in examining the printout and borrowed it. This was the last I saw of it. He reported that it proved most useful in helping him prepare his talks and asked to keep it a while. After selecting a Biblical text or texts on which to base his sermon, he checked the appropriate part of the printout to determine if any such text were treated in _The Urantia Book_. If so, he also read _The Urantia Book_ version. If he liked it, he would use it; if not, he would disregard it. He volunteered that he was surprised that so many of his texts, particularly from the Gospels, were found in _The Urantia Book_ and that he had used far more _Urantia Book_ materials than he had ignored.

I asked him if his congregation knew that he was using the book in preparing his sermons. He replied, “No, they are not ready for that yet. Whenever appropriate I incorporate teachings of the book not only in my talks, but in my public and private conversations, but the source of the teachings — no.” He pointed out that there was very little difference between the Bible and _The Urantia Book_ concerning the incidents that happened during the lifetime of Jesus, and that he found _The Urantia Book_ interpretation to be the more acceptable, even without accrediting the source. The same was true of many Old Testament stories — they made more sense in _The Urantia Book_'s historical perspective.

When I was preparing to leave England, the Vicar still had the printout. He asked that I leave it with him because he found it useful and, since I had the original disks, I could duplicate the printout. There was no indication as to whether or not it improved the quality of his homilies, but it certainly facilitated the preparation process.

Ministers who have personal reservations about the authenticity of the book, or feel that their congregations are not ready for it, may wish to expand their exposition of Biblical themes with illustrations and concepts inspired by _The Urantia Book_. Its Christology reflects some lofty concepts only dimly presented in the Bible. In my judgment, the Jesus depicted in Part IV of the book is both more “human” and more “divine” than the Jesus shown in the pages of the Bible. Furthermore, the Foreword and first ten papers of _The Urantia Book_ present the most highly developed and succinctly presented concepts of Deity it has been my privilege to find in all other sources combined. A full understanding of these papers cannot help but provide a new paradigm against which to see and understand God.

The late Clyde Bedell compiled a combination concordance and topical index which is published under the coined name _Concordex_. It is the most comprehensive instrument available through which one can find any specific item or general concept in _The Urantia Book_. Any serious researcher is handicapped without it.

The computer printout referred to above has now been published under the coined name _Paramony_. It is an extensive cross-reference between _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible through which the user can go in either direction between similar passages of the two books. It is also useful as either a parallel or a harmony.

Those who love the Bible will find the _Paramony_ to be a most useful tool. It can be used to deepen one's understanding and love for either book by becoming aware of their similarities and differences; or it can be used to point out the shortcomings or limitations of either book. The _Paramony_ is not a commentary on either book, but rather a tool for discovering if a matter covered in one is also included in the other and, if so, where it is located. Comparisons are left to the reader.

Those formerly apathetic to Christianity, or even turned off by it, who have found a personal relationship with God through _The Urantia Book_ often develop a curiosity about the Bible. The _Paramony_ offers them an easy access to parallel Biblical teachings. It is surprising how many people have developed a new respect for the Bible through this process.

No one should be afraid of truth; indeed, we should all welcome it. Yet, Pilate's perennial question, “What is truth?” still challenges humankind. Readers of the Bible and/or _The Urantia Book_ are confronted with this problem of truth evaluation. One person's “truth” is another person's “heresy,” and still another person's “superstition.” Although the Bible and _The Urantia Book_ are in basic agreement concerning the nature of God and spiritual reality, each person must rely on his or her inner spiritual guidance in making their own truth affirmations.

Ministers, by the nature of their training and practical needs, are usually interested in commentaries on the relationship between God and humankind. It makes little difference whether such commentaries confirm, challenge, or contradict their beliefs. In any case their thinking is stimulated. Hopefully, the end result of this intellectual and spiritual grappling is growth. The Vicar in the above story is a case in point. He is still a closet reader. He accepts, or puts on a shelf, much of _Urantia Book_ theology for himself; but he is not ready to ask his parishioners to do so. Yet he is subconsciously preparing a way for their acceptance of the book by using its teachings in his sermons.

Upon my return from England, I found my home church had a minister who was extremely personable and reflected a deep love of God, but whose sermons were not very inspiring. As chairman of the Parish-Pastor Relations Committee, this concerned me. One day I took him aside and asked him to do me a personal favor. I handed him a copy of _The Urantia Book_, and a copy of the paperback “Experimental Edition” of the _Paramony_ which was hot off the press. I told him I had printed 200 copies of a prototype of the _Paramony_ as an experiment to determine whether or not illustrations from _The Urantia Book_ would be useful to ministers in the preparation of their sermons. I asked him to not read _The Urantia Book_ until he had determined the scripture which he was to use as a text, and then to look up the passage in the _Paramony_. If it referred to a passage in _The Urantia Book_, he was to read it for possible use in his sermon. The next few Sundays several members of the congregation commented to me on how good his sermons were. Each Sunday I checked his text with the _Paramony_ and found at least one reference to it in _The Urantia Book_. On no Sunday did his approach to his subject conflict with the approach of _The Urantia Book_. It was not until the fifth Sunday, when he was preaching on “The Woman at the Well,” that I had proof positive that he was using _The Urantia Book_ as a reference source: he called the woman “Nalda.” Not a soul in the congregation except me and my wife noticed it.

Since publication of the first hardback edition of the _Paramony_ in 1986, I have received many letters from ministers, Sunday School teachers, and others telling me how useful it has been in helping them to prepare for their public presentations. The real surprise is how many have written to say it has helped them with their private studies of the two books. Only one letter contained a criticism, and even that letter was more positive than negative. Several pointed out typographical errors, which will be corrected in the 2 nd edition. Letters indicating both errors and omissions are invited.
