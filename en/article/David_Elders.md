## Bio

As a student of _The Urantia Book_ for almost 30 years, David Elders has tried to live up to the challenges and responsibilities of its teachings in his personal life as well as within the Brotherhood-Fellowship via service in various functional positions. He and his wife, Marta, who shares this dedication to the teachings, have raised two sons who have embarked on their own family journeys.

David Elders has been a student of _The Urantia Book_ since 1970 and has explored the amazing concept of personality as revealed in the book for most of that time. He and Marta have been married for forty-three years and are experiencing one of the fruits of that partnership—the five grandchildren their two sons and their wives have brought into the world.
