The Christmas season is the time to give and receive gifts in most Christian families and populations. 

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, through Derek Samaras, donated the book [Jesus —a New Revelation](https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-A-New-Revelation/dp/0966878302) to the Philippine people. Although shipped months ago, the books were received around Christmas time! The Philippines is eighty-five percent Christian and predominantly Catholic. 

I believe that Christians should know the missing life of Jesus. Filipinos welcome the new revelation, especially on the life of Jesus, the Creator Son of our universe.

Urantia Foundation, _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, and Urantia Association International have been very supportive of the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ in the Philippines, for which we are truly grateful. _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship sponsored the 2019 National Educational Convention with the guest speaker André Radatus. Teamwork among groups is exercised and becomes the source of success.

_Pasko_ is a festive holiday on December 25 celebrating the birth of Jesus. The customs of Christians, pre-Christians, non-Christians, and other secular traditions are all blended on this occasion. There are over ten million Filipinos living in many countries outside the Philippines observing this _Pasko_ season. 

_Urantia Books_ are part of giving and receiving gifts. Service is in giving, in sharing newly acquired truths with others. Jesus of Nazareth was never in a hurry; he never stopped talking to people, especially those who sought him out.

Here in the United States, many female Filipino professionals are in the medical profession. They are part of the healing force of the communities. In the Philippines, just under half of the population are women and just over half are men. When traveling in neigh borhoods, small towns, villages, and cities, women are inherently able to bridge the gap between the esus A New Revelation spiritual and the material worlds. We are pleased with the welcoming spirits of most women in accepting Urantia Books in schools, colleges, universities, trade schools, and also in their homes.

With an ever-evolving culture in family life, women remain the citadel of love and compassion.
