_By Jean Ramsay_
_Victoria, British Columbia_

With the thought in mind of sharing with other readers some of the thoughts and feelings I experienced in the formative years leading up to my introduction to _The Urantia Book_ revelation, I must refer back to the time in my life when I was faced with something called, “an identity crisis.” A failed marriage had plunged me into a deep depression to the point where my life no longer had meaning and thoughts of suicide obsessed me. I sought help in counseling and was advised to go to church and tum my messed-up life over to God.

Up to that time, my knowledge of God was barely what I had picked up from the meager gleanings of various Sunday School teachers and I was not impressed with the picture. I grew up with a distorted image of a harsh and cruel master who punished disobedient little girls and slew old people and even little babies by casting them alive in an awful place called Hell. I wanted no part of this God! But, in my desperation I seemed to have no other choice. So, off to church I went. And I began to listen to a whole, new concept of God as a kind and loving Father. I began to read the bible and discovered the gospels. I found a friend in Jesus who seemed to understand my need. I liked what he said and taught concerning the Kingdom. He was simple and straight-forward. The theme of his message never varied. He was no respecter of persons, nor possessions, nor even the scribes and the pharisees. And he loved people and had compassion for the poor and the afflicted. He talked to God as to a loving, wise, forgiving Father, “... who so loved the world that He gave His only Son,” not to condemn us, but to help us and to teach us Kingdom Truth that we should not perish but have eternal life. I loved this new concept of God and turned more and more to the study of the scriptures.

But, as the depression lifted, I became somewhat confused by the many contradictions I encountered. I questioned my teachers, but got no satisfaction. I visited other churches and found only sectarianism and intolerance. No two were alike in their beliefs except in one respect; they all thought that they, alone, were right and all the others wrong. But, surely someone, somewhere had the TRUTH. Or were they all wrong? I turned back to Jesus who claimed to be the truth and I read again as for the first time In the Book of John, chapters 14,15 , and 16 of a promise he made to his grieving, bewildered, disciples. He would ask the Father to send a “comforter”...“Holy Spirit”... even the “Spirit of Truth” — who would lead us into <ins>ALL</ins> truth. Wow! Just what I needed! But how do I get it? — “Ask, and you shall receive.” So, I asked. Nothing happened. I asked again and again. I just kept hammering at the door.

Six months later (and about to throw in the towel) in a moment of quiet waiting in the home of friends, the Heavens opened and I was suddenly caught up in a blaze of effulgent glory that defies mere words to describe. I tasted and drank of the pure spirit of holiness and purity such as man can only dream of. I was transformed instantly into the image and likeness of The Son — and for one shining moment I was privileged to stand on holy ground.

This happened to me forty-four years ago, on February 26, 1948 and I've never looked back. My life was changed and my real search for the truth began in eamest. I had never so much as heard the word, “Thought Adjuster” but I know with certainty that He was, even then, the guiding principal that patiently and wisely watched over me, and helped shape the events and circumstances leading to the experience above. And eventually, through much learning, listening, and following the light, having read and devoured many great books by devout and dedicated searchers after truth - I was brought face-to-face with the greatest of all books, _The Urantia Book_. Ilooked at the name, Urantia, and something went “twang” inside of me. I knew a moment of magic, as The Spirit witnessed with my spirit. This book was for me. I took it in my hands and felt the weight of it and knew there were treasures just waiting to be claimed between the pages. I was not bemused. I just knew, and knew that I knew. And, somewhere in the unseen realms of spiritknowing, I think my faithful Thought Adjuster smiled.

Another epoch in my life had been reached. In 1989 I attended my first readers conference. I met other members of a growing family of readers and I found a warm and lovely spirit of openness and acceptance. We were all of one mind and the fellowship was sweet like honey in the comb. There were no age differences, neither color, nor creed. I loved it. I greatly enjoy the weekly group meetings where we are free to share our thoughts and feelings as we read together through the voluminous papers, tasting and sorting the meanings and values of what is written.

The high moments for me are when I come across a word or a phrase in the book that triggers a “twang” (for lack of a better word) inside, of recognition, confirming a truth or concept I had already formed, and to which I had never given voice — pure evidence of that Spirit of Truth, promised by Jesus. I heartily recommend it for all who read these words.

In the presence of non-readers, I deliberately cultivate an air of “quiet confidence” that seems to challenge certain people into asking me a reason for my cheerfulness, plus an appearence of youthfulness that belies my eighty-seven years. I'm quick to seize this opportunity and tell them first about the blue-green algae food supplement that I take daily for my bodily needs — and, second, I read Urantia for my soul's great satisfaction! This method seldom fails in gaining one new reader of the book, and I can count at least twelve trophies to my credit.

Thank you all for listening. I welcome your comments and would enjoy hearing from anyone who cares to write. I have many things waiting in my storehouse available to those who ask, the ripened fruit of all the years of my pilgrimage. Especially to my peers now, I call you seniors.

Please write and share with me as I have shared with you. Teenagers, wouldn't you like to know what life was like when I was sweet sixteen? Then, write to me. Every letter will be answered.

Yours for a closer walk with God.
