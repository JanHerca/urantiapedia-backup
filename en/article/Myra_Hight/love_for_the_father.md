The Prisoner Inquiry Response Team (PIRT) would like to share this beautiful art, an example of the value in fostering the study of _The Urantia Book_ in prisons. The artist is Reinaldo Dennes and he is in a Texas prison. Reinaldo was introduced to _The Urantia Book_ eight years ago by a fellow reader doing in-person prison ministry. Reinaldo remains a dedicated student whose heart is filled with love for God and the teachings.

If you would like to use Reinaldo’s art in your Urantia works, please [Contact PIRT](mailto:prt@urantia-association.org)

> If a kindhearted man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not immediately leave the ninety and nine and go out in search of the one that has gone astray? And if he is a good shepherd, will he not keep up his quest for the lost sheep until he finds it? And then, when the shepherd has found his lost sheep, he lays it over his shoulder and, going home rejoicing, calls to his friends and neighbors, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’ I declare that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety and nine righteous persons who need no repentance. Even so, it is not the will of my Father in heaven that one of these little ones should go astray, much less that they should perish. <a id="a51_753"></a>[[UB 159:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_2)]
