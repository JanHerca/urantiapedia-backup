<p>On Completion
William Trimble, USA</p>
<p>To be in the world is to feel incomplete.
Completion will take place at some unknown future date.
Names of permanence will be bestowed illuminating one’s true inner nature.
Fusion with the fragment of God within will be accomplished.
The two will become as one.
It will be a time of great rejoicing, wonder an accomplishment.</p>
<p>What an incredible adventure awaits us!
When we awake from our earthly slumber, we will have a new and more perfect body.
It will be perfect in design, form, and function.
Our new bodies will better express the inner quality of our being.
That quality of being that God gives each of us will be made more plain.
Love and brotherhood will replace fear and suspicion.
Your neighbor will be your friend; your friend, your neighbor.
No more will you hear the cries of those in mourning, nor those in pain.
Laughter and optimism will conquer self-absorption and pessimism.
These negative, immature emotions will no longer loom as a spiritual plague.
The fruits of the spiritual life will surround you, and you shall want for naught.
Experiences with brilliant and charming beings will challenge your every belief.
Your senses will grow in number.
Those you had before will become ever more acute.
You will find delight in doing the will of God.
God’s will becomes your will.
Only then will we experience completion in potential.
Final personality, destiny of attainment.</p>
