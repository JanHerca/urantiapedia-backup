Sermon by **Rev. Craig T. McClellan**

Scripture: [Mark 2:1-12](/en/Bible/Mark/2#v1)

Note: I am indebted to a story in Jesus' ministry described in _The Urantia Book_ (<a id="a37_83"></a>[UB 130:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p6_1)) which I have reworded and enhanced with the Scripture Lesson.

I'm going to present this morning's sermon in the form of a guided meditation. So, I suggest that you sit in a relaxed way, whatever is comfortable for you in terms of your hands and your legs. If you have anything in your hands, I suggest that you set it beside you. [pause...] I would ask that you would close your eyes, relax in the presence of God, . . . and focus inwardly on this story about our Lord Jesus that I want to share with you... Be conscious of your breathing ... as the breath of life, physically and spiritually, ... moves in you and through you. As you feel the breath drawn inward, center down. ... Center down and hear this story of God...

We're going back to the first century in this story — back to the time when our Lord walked this earth. Jesus in one of his journeys came across a young man, barely sixteen years old, who had fled his mother and gone to seek solitude in the mountains. This was not, however, a solitude of spiritual seeking, but of being lonely and lost in life... For this young man had never found his way in life ever since his father died when he was twelve.

He was angry and confused. He wanted to know, why had God taken his father? And why had God made it so difficult to find out his own identity and worth?... He had become sullen and withdrawn, except when he would cry with self-pity, or yell out echoing through the mountains — yelling out for the presence of God. Increasingly, he was able to do only those few things necessary to survive another day...

So, you can imagine how startled he was when Jesus came upon him. Jesus simply said, “Greetings my son, why are you so downcast on such a beautiful day?” But the lad refused to talk. Jesus thought for a moment, seeking another approach to the young man's soul. Now Jesus knew these mountains as well, probably better than the lad; but, to strike-up a conversation, he asked the young man the best way to a nearby town.

At this, the lad spoke readily, and Jesus engaged him at every turn. Then, after some trust had been established, Jesus turned and said, “My Son, just as you have helped me find my way, so I want to return the favor by answering your plea for help out of your darkness of personal sorrow and confusion.”

Much to the young man's surprise, he was suddenly near tears. It was as if Jesus had looked straight into his soul... The young man was overcome, but he managed to stammer, “But... but... I didn't ask you for anything!”

“No,” Jesus declared, “not with words, my son, but I heard the eloquent appeal for help in your countenance of discouragement and despair. Come sit with me while I tell you of the way which leads from the sorrows of self to the happiness of serving your fellow man, and from confusion of mind to the peace of living in the truth of God.”

With this, the young man fell to his knees before Jesus, imploring our Lord to help him. Then Jesus declared: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! You may have had many difficulties in your short life, and you may have been set back by heavy obstacles, but know that all the spiritual powers of the universe are with you, are guiding you, and watching over you. ... The very sun above rises every morning to salute you just as it does the most powerful and prosperous man on this earth. You are trying to run away from your unhappy self, but it cannot be done. Your problems are indeed real, you cannot escape them. You must face them! You must face them, learn from them, conquer them, overcome them, and move on to the grand and glorious life that God offers you... God has blessed you with a sturdy body and a strong mind. Even more, made in God's image, you have the ability to love your fellow man and to embrace all creation. God has even blessed you with the power to create with Him and in Him. Let this flood your soul and raise you to an awareness that you-yes, you — are born a child of God... So, I tell you to cease living like a paralyzed man. Let go of your sorrow and confusion! Fight the good fight of faith, and let not the trials and tribulations of this world paralyze you. ... So, I say to you: arise, take up your bedroll, and go home! This day, my son, you are to be reborn, reestablished, as a man of faith and courage. You are to be rededicated and devoted to the service of humanity and to the love of God, and when you have become renewed to life within yourself and within the very universe itself, then you are born again — born of the Spirit. Henceforth, your whole life will become one of the victorious accomplishments in God... Trouble will invigorate you; obstacles will stimulate you. Arise, young man! Say farewell to sorrow and confusion! Hurry back to duty and live as a Son of God — as a person of God dedicated to the ennobling service of humanity on earth, and destined to the glorious service of God in all eternity.”

And the young man arose, took up his bedroll, and went home. He was utterly amazed, and he glorified God saying, “Never have I been so alive!” ...

Thus, the story is over, but it is not finished-because it is also your story. Each of you has sorrows and confusion, and heartaches and disappointments that threaten to paralyze you. There are times when you feel like all you want to do is to run off and hide. And, yes, there are times when you doubt whether God is with you or even cares about you. But, if you remain faithful, even with all your doubt and pain — if you remain faithful-God comes to you, comes to you even now in the power and peace of Christ, comes to you to heal you and uplift you!

This does not mean that your problems suddenly disappear. But, it does mean that you have a strength and a confidence to face life that you never knew you possessed — that you know does not come from you — but comes from that Power and Love that created you and saves you. In this strength and grace that comes through Christ, you are born again each and every day. And you know there is nothing that you and God cannot face together.

So, in the name of Jesus Christ, I say to you: Arise, take up your life, and walk! ... For you have been given new life, new hope, new strength in God to be alive-alive in the Lord-this day and forever. Amen.
