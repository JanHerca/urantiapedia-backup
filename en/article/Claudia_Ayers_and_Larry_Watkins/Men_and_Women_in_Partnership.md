By Claudia Ayers and Larry Watkins, Sacramento, California

Contemporary writers often express the viewpoint that men and women are essentially alike in goals and aspirations, mental function and social needs. Except for biologic disparity, the differences between men and women are frequently assumed to be manifestations of socialization processes. These suppositions are not supported by _The Urantia Book_.

In our study of the complementary natures and potential of men and women in partnership, we depict, contrary to these current contentions, the emphasis of _The Urantia Book_ that women and men are not essentially the same nor are we expected to achieve the same goals. (_See Group I quotes_.)

We are created as two distinct types of beings, two varieties of the same species. This is not a cosmic mistake. There is meaning and plan to such diversity. Distinctly different, the sexes are frameworks upon which our mortal characters express divine potentials, particularly in developing creative partnerships. Teamwork and cooperation between men and women are essential to human development. (_See Group 2 quotes_.)

A number of current articles and books acknowledge that gender differences are real and they show up early. An article in _Redbook_ (Sept. 1992, Susan Chira) says, “From the moment they enter the classroom, boys and girls tend to behave differently.”

In a popular book, _You Just Don't Understand_, Deborah Tannen relates after observing second graders, “Comparing the boys and girls of the same age I had the feeling I was looking at two different species.” She goes on to say that even from early childhood, males learn to get status and identity from independence while females gain standing by developing intimacy. Men's interest in the details of politics, news and sports seems to parallel women's interest in the details of personal lives. The game women play is “Do you like me?” The game men play is “Do you respect me?”

An article by Lori Andrews in _Parents_ (April 1986) explains that “males tend to view themselves more as individuals, while females view themselves as part of a web of relationships.”

As a result, the ways men and women communicate with each other are often confusing.

Tannen captured a concern of many women when she wrote, “Some women fear, with justification, that any observation of gender differences will be heard as implying that it is women who are different — different from the standard, which is whatever men are. The male is seen as normative; the female as departing from the norm.”

She went on to say, “Pretending that women and men are the same hurts women, because the ways they are treated are based on the norms for men.”

Men tend to use an interaction style which challenges authority and jockeys for position. They gain status by asserting an individual and independent view. Most women tend to seek interconnectedness, intimacy, relating by consensus, group processing, cooperation and gain status when well liked.

A man who believes he treats women and men equally may be using the same masculine communications style with women that he uses with men, a style which can cause hard feelings among women.

While there is considerable overlap in the following list of characteristics, studies generally support the following gender-related character traits:

| ***Males*** generally are: | ***Females*** generally are: |
| :--- | :--- |
| independent | interconnected |
| objective | subjective |
| active | neat |
| competitive | tactful |
| logical | intuitive |
| decision makers | collaborative workers |
| providers | nurturers |
| directors | comforters |
| aggressive | passive |
| bold | patient and kind |
| courageous | gentle and meek |
| strong | sensitive and sincere |
| autocratic | democratic |
| spatial thinkers | artistic |
| motivators | responsive |
| specialty teachers | generalists |
| selfish | selfless |
| doers | good listeners |

Even though _The Urantia Book_ confirms that men and women are not essentially the same nor expected to achieve the same goals, from a feminist point of view it has some surprising things to say in support of basic feminist attitudes on equal rights. (_See Group 3 quotes_.)

Numerous accounts of the historical struggle between men and women are given in _The Urantia Book_. (_See Group 4 quotes_.)

Many other passages relate the values of partnership, especially in relationship to the family. (_See Group 5 quotes_.)

The role religion plays in retarding the progress of equality between men and women is evident. (_See Group 6 quotes_.)

The revealed religion of _The Urantia Book_ may do more to discourage and neutralize the dominating role men have held over women than has been proclaimed since Jesus was among us. The message to be taken to contemporary social policy idealists is: Be aware that inherent differences between the sexes have value and must not be pushed aside in the otherwise appropriate goal of obtaining equal rights for women.

Jesus is the role model for the development of our character. The primary intent of Jesus' earth mission was spiritual. His life demonstrated the gospel of the kingdom, the family relationship between God and creatures.

Jesus was successful in staying clear of the social and political issues of his times. Yet, to those with the eyes to see, he demonstrated a sociopolitical ideal in gender relations. Furthermore, in one being, he exemplified the ideal character values for both masculine and feminine roles. (_See Group 7 quotes_.)

There is a divine plan exalting the relationship between masculine and feminine personality revealed in _The Urantia Book_. It is portrayed in the relationship between the Creator Son and the Creative Mother Spirit. Their roles are dissimilar, yet they work in harmony for the benefit of all their creation. In this divine relationship are symbolized appropriate gender roles for mortals. As we work to develop our potentials through partnership relationships, this important celestial relationship becomes our most meaningful study. (_See Group 8 quotes_.)
