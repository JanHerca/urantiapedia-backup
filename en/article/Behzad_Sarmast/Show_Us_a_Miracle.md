For as long as history bears record, human nature has always associated godliness with some miraculous wonder. There is a natural craving for some outstanding source of authority that can show the way, but wise words and exalted teachings alone will not do - there must also be a display of supernatural powers. This was as true in the days of Caligastia's arrival as it is today, and the world still expects the arrival of the next celestial being to coincide with either a stupendous phenomenon in the sky, a miraculous disappearance of the elect, or some other wonder that defies reason.

We know that Jesus did not wish to resort to miracles as a way of procuring faith, and yet it was inevi-table that the masses would persuade him to reveal his power. After all, humanity was designed by divine beings that defy simple reason, and it seems only natural that the creature desires to see the omnipotence of the cre-ator. Of course, the personalities who are responsible for our planetary evolution are only too aware of this phenomenon, as they have consistently provided what can only be described as mind-boggling displays of supernatural feats.

From the very First Epochal Revelation, being the arrival of Caligastia, we can see the development of this trend. The staff of 100 was not only extraordinary to look at, but they also lived perpetually for hundreds of thousands of years, never aging a day. From their head-quarters in Dalamatia, they taught humanity the art of civilization and provided tools that were nothing short of miracles for that day and age. Would the natives have listened to the new and bizarre teachings of this small group if they had not displayed some wonder? Not likely.

The Second Epochal Revelation was no less intrigu-ing, as Adam and Eve were even more wondrous to be-hold. Radiating a violet hue and standing eight feet tall, they were striking in appearance. Clearly, the celestial overseers were not hesitant to manifest the supernatural nature of this dynamic couple, as their earthly career began with a public materialization directly in the center of Eden. From this first amazing phenomenon, witnessed by the “mighty throng” of people who were in the temple, to the later creation of agricultural tools, medicines and foods, there was little associated with the Adamic mission that was not extraordinary. Would the people of that day have listened to Adam and Eve's description of a heavenly Father if the couple had not performed incredible feats? Not likely.

Melchizedek's arrival as the Third Epochal Revelation was certainly more low-key, as it was an unusual emergency mission, but he was hardly an ordinary man. An outstanding teacher and organizer, in a short time he became the King of Salem and the light of the world. What did his students think as they aged and grew old while their king lived on generation after generation, never aging a day? How much stronger of an impression did he make on the races because of his outrageous and death-defying nature? Would the people of that day have deified this mighty celestial, had he not shown himself to be extraordinary? Not likely.

Of course, the Fourth Epochal Revelation did not disappoint anyone in regards to the display of miracles. Jesus' reluctance to rely on supernatural feats did not prevent the manifestation of the greatest miracles this world has ever seen. Indeed, he performed more miracles than all the other three epochal revelations combined. Did he have to resort to miracles? No, but would the savage world have forsaken its ways for even an extraordinary teacher, if he was no more than an ordinary mortal? Not likely.

So what about the Fifth Epochal Revelation? How can we compare a book with the other epochal revelations that caused such indelible advancements to human culture? What kind of an impact can we expect from a few words on paper? How is _The Urantia Book_ going to change the world in any way that is comparable to the other epochal revelations? Are the people of our generation going to give up their egocentric and barbaric ways and pay heed to a book with loving words? Not likely.

But is it possible that we are underestimating the immediate potential of _The Urantia Book_? Are there clues hidden in the text that will soon prove to be veritable miracles, and not just for the readers but for the world at large?

## A Celestial Rosetta Stone

Some of the subtle statements and clues hidden between the lines of _The Urantia Book_ have already helped this researcher to decode the classical mythology of our planet. Used like a Rosetta Stone, the revelation connects the missing links in some of our world's greatest mysteries, effectively solving riddles that have perplexed humanity for thousands of years. The information is so rich and condensed that it is truly impossible for us to understand the longevity of this powerful work, and its effects on generations to conic. But the process has already begun, and in a soon-to-be published book, “_Garden of the Gods: The Lost History of Eden in World Mythology and the Discovery of Atlantis,_” Urantia will get a glimpse of this phenomenon.

It is difficult to stress the importance of the Adamic story in _The Urantia Book_, and its amazing parallels with mankind's oldest historic records and myths. A study of the pre-Christian mythology reveals a world that was largely enamored with the story of a god and goddess who “fell to earth” from other worlds, and brought mankind the gift of civilization. From Mesopotamia to Palestine, Greece, Egypt, Persia, and Rome, it was generally believed that this sacred couple was responsible for those civilizing factors that went on to bring humanity out of a savage state. And unlike the biblical story of Adam and Eve, our ancient ancestors seriously believed, and explicitly stated, that the god and goddess came to earth at a time when it was already populated, and shared their holy and “immortal blood” with the primitive natives.

The Sumerian trinity of Enki, Enlil, and An (referred to in the _The Urantia Book_ as the Babylonian triad: Ea, Bel, and Anu) is virtually a perfect match with _the Urantia Book_'s description of Adam, Michael, and the Universal Father. Enki was known as the “Lord of the Earth,” and was credited for giving civilization to mankind, as well as creating a superior race along with his consort, the holy Mother Goddess Inanna/Ishtar. Enlil was an elder brother of Enki, and ruled the space between the earth and heaven, while Anu was a supreme Father God who ruled over all the other gods and permanently resided in Heaven. The description of the nature and function of these gods, found engraved on ancient texts buried for thousands of years, is truly an uncanny experience for a _Urantia Book_ student.

In Egypt, Isis and Osiris were credited as ancient gods who descended to earth with physical bodies and put an end to cannibalism and savagery, teaching mankind to grow food from the earth and lead religious lives. Their evil brother Set (root for Satan) trapped Osiris and put an end to the mission.

Persian mythology recounts the story of Mithra and Anahita, who appeared miraculously on earth and brought the gift of wheat for mankind. Mithra was believed to have died at the hands of his enemies, who had tried in vain to stop his holy blood and semen from reaching the earth.

Aphrodite and Adonis in Greece, as well as Cybele and Attis in Rome were worshipped in like manner, and were credited with bringing civilization to our planet. The legendary love between the god and goddess was celebrated throughout the world, and their life and death struggle formed the basis of the most sacred holidays and their associated rituals. To this day, the citizens of the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean Sea tell visitors how Aphrodite once flew on a giant bird around their island, looking for her beloved Adonis. Indeed, much of the incredible statements in _The Urantia Book_ about Adam and Eve's life, such as their flights on the fandor birds, were merely common lore to the ancients.

The understanding of world mythology, and its direct parallels with _The Urantia Book_ story of Adam and Eve, also acts as a key that unravels many other mysteries as well. The glaring similarity of Jesus' life and death story with the older story of the mystery hero has puzzled researchers for two thousand years, and has been consistently used as an excuse by the secular world in order to discount Jesus as a mere myth. It is only through the multi-dimensional nature of the information in the Fifth Epochal Revelation that this mystery can be fully explained (covered in “_Garden of the Gods_,”) thus helping us to present the tactical genius of Jesus in a completely new and unique way.

## Eden/Atlantis Found

_The Urantia Book_ provides something else, however, that is utterly unique among all the other epochal revelations. For the first time in history, a revelation has come to our hands that not only reveals a celestial hierarchy in intimate detail, but also gives fairly precise descriptions about the physical shape and location of our world's greatest lost treasures, such as Dalamatia and the original Garden of Eden. In other words, while the previous revelations focused solely on our spiritual progress, the Urantia Papers actually provide clues about the geographical location of lost cities that we can physically find. This is truly a first and it adds another component to the book, which is literally acting as a treasure map.

It can now be publicly announced that through the use of bathymetric data from the best and most authoritative sources in the world, the peninsula of Eden has been located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We have produced computer-generated images that depict the seafloor in detail, and the peninsula is clearly and unmistakably visible, precisely as described in the Urantia Papers. On every point, from the given location to the geographical descriptions about the surrounding mountains, it is an exact match. The river path is clearly discernible as it once headed east toward the mainland, as well as the broken neck area, the central mound and the four surrounding sectors on Eden Proper. These original images will be published in “_Garden of the Gods,_” and while they may only be enough to convince _The Urantia Book_ students for now, plans are already underway to make expeditions that will convince the rest of the world.

It is certain that the authors of the Urantia Papers deliberately included these geographical clues, fully aware of the consequences and the inevitable impact. Locating the giant stone wall of the Father's temple on Eden would turn the world on its head, as there are no rational explanations for its existence almost a mile under water; it is now only a matter of time. In other words, the celestials have provided certain telltale clues in the Urantia Papers that they knew would eventually lead to astonishing archaeological discoveries, and effectively draw worldwide attention to the revelation.

## Sleeping Giant

While good research into various areas of the revelation has already been presented by Urantians around the world, the verification of its most significant scientific clues must simply wait for further technological progress. In the next few decades, our scientific understanding of DNA will continue to grow in leaps and bounds, and the inevitable isolation of Adam and Eve's fingerprints on the planetary gene pool will confirm the information provided in the revelation. All the clues about the location and movement of various races are likewise due to he validated in conjunction with future archaeological discoveries. In every category from astronomy to geology, we can look forward to continuous discoveries that will go well beyond the inner and spiritual confirmations.

It is therefore clear that _The Urantia Book_ is a sleeping giant, and has the built-in material necessary to satiate mankind's “miracle-minded” mentality. So as this newest revelation slowly moves from its private, one-on-one career to its more public mission, we can rest assured that its authors fully understand the nature of humanity, and have designed the book to gain gradual appeal for centuries to come.

As for this reader, after an exhaustive research into the spiritual, historical, and scientific authenticity of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, and watching in awe as the Garden of Eden come to life before my eyes, I am now fully prepared to give testimony:

I have seen a miracle!
