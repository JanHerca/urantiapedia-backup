Forty years have elapsed since the Fifth Epochal Revelation was given to our world. Step by step a new generation is taking over the helmsmanship of our nations. Consider that during that period we have seen another world war and several other major military engagements. This should prompt us to remember that “_Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment._” (<a id="a36_480"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)).

We should reflect therefore on the special role the Most High Assistant is playing on our planet in leading the twelve corps of the master seraphim of planetary supervision. The task of co-ordinating the multifarious talents of the different groups in times such as these deserves our greatest admiration and appreciation as well nigh all the institutions we have come to accept are undergoing deep transformations that will lead us in due time to a world settled in light and life.

Due to the ever-increasing contrasts in the standards of living between the countries who have industries and the struggling countries of the Third World, we shall see a significant shift of the master seraphim in assisting the regional development of Africa, East and West Asia, and Latin America. This change of direction will require the quintessential collaboration of the progress angels, the angels of nation life, and the angels of the future in the affairs of men.

For indeed in the next stage of our evolution the self-determination which has been the clarion call of nationalism will gradually evolve into the political sovereignty of regions bathed by oceans or seas. Third World nations are discovering that their integration can be accelerated through economic and social co-operation. In Latin America and West Asia common traditions, language, culture, and religion will enhance their innate sense of brotherhood. This development will help redress the balance required on Urantia away from a bi-polar world. While we may regret temporarily this leaning toward regionalism as a postponement of a planetary government, we should be conscious that the centrifugal forces have to reach their maximum before planetary unification can take place. As students of _The URANTIA Book_ we are strengthened spiritually in the knowledge that the coming changes in the structures will eventually bring about the brotherhood of man on Urantia. “_The rule of the Most Highs, the overcontrollers of political evolution, is a rule designed to foster the greatest good to the greatest number of all men and for the greatest length of time._” (<a id="a42_1167"></a>[UB 134:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_4)).
