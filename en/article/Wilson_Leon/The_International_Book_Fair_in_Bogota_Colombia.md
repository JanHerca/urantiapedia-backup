_By Wilson León, Bogotá, Colombia_

On behalf of Urantia Association Colombia and the Bogotá Urantia Association, we are pleased to inform you of the results of our having had a booth at the international book fair in Bogotá this past April. Also, we are grateful to Urantia Association International for donating 167 copies of the Spanish translation to our association. And thanks to Urantia Foundation, we now have an excellent import channel through which to obtain _El Libro de Urantia_ at an affordable price.

The results of the book fair include:

- A reunion with people who have been reading the book for a long time.
- Over 7,500 flyers were distributed.
- More than 500 email addresses were collected.
- More than 230 Urantia Books were sold.
- Thirty-nine readers tended our booth at the fair.

Our future plans include:

- Giving talks to introduce the book.
- Hosting conferences and workshops.
- Hosting workshops to train teachers and leaders.
- Selling 667 books in 2014.
- Starting a study group in Ombú and other areas.
- Visiting study groups throughout Colombia.
- Growing from 15 study groups to 20.
- Launching a Urantia-related website for readers in Colombia.

Thank you UAI and Urantia Foundation for your help for which we are most appreciative. And now, if you will excuse me, I must get to work with other readers to materialize our future plans.

_Vaya con Dios._
