Dear friends, 

This issue is an exciting first for us, as it is our first multilingual edition of the Mighty Messenger. The beautiful cover art was created especially for this edition by artist Stephen Sawyer (of [art4god.com](https://www.art4god.com/)) to reflect the many cultures we are celebrating together. 

To build even more inclusiveness, our publications team has been working hard to not only create separate editions for Spanish and English, but to curate the contributions of our Spanish writers, who are sharing about their own projects, events, and experiences spreading the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. 

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship now has fourteen Area Coordinators and Field Workers across eleven Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Spain, and Venezuela. And we have word that some are planning to come to Chicago, Illinois, for our International Conference 2023 (IC23) in July and are hoping to present some of the great workshops that they have developed over the years. We are so grateful for these enthusiastic partnerships! 

Another _first_, inside is an extensive report on the first-ever Urantia conference in Uganda, held in Jinja City in August, 2022, with the theme "The Gift of Revelation: The Life and Teachings of Jesus." We also have recent updates from the Philippines, and from our very busy [International Fellowship Committee](https://urantiabook.org/About-The-Urantia-Book-Fellowship#international). We are delighted to take this next step with you and hope you Will enjoy being one step closer, through shared culture, language, and art, to our brothers and sisters in once-distant lands. Please write to us with your feedback: publications@urantiabook.org
