As we often tell you
The world is all about vibrations
We permeate your mind
From different songs

:notes: Don't worry, be happy
When we want to call you back
That life was given to you
In order to make the most of it

:notes: I raised you up to more that you could be
So that you understand that this life
Is intended for your elevation
An eternal progression

Your soul sings :notes: All the love I have for you
In your painful moments of dismay
And :notes: Hallelujahs
In your moments of joy

Not to mention the many :notes: I surrender
To teach you that with fear
There is no point in resisting
To God you must abandon everything

I sang to you :notes: The divine child was born
When the moment came
To announce the arrival to you
Of a new Divinity

We made the :notes: Ave Maria vibrate
When you accompanied your dad
In the last moments of his life
And you two were more than happy about it.

Yes everything is in vibrations
A music, songs
Everything is in perpetual evolution
Not in any direction

That of progress we follow
We are constantly guiding you
Towards new destinies
Continuously renewed

Get everyone in tune
Sing with us in unison
In order to create this new era
Beginnings of life and light

Now is the time to get in tune,
in order to adjust your vibration frequency.
Remember that this revelation
Is especially for future generations!

Laying foundations
Request for harmonization
No, not dissension
Playtime is over

It's time for reunification
To bring back all the factions
Time for self-regulation
And reconciliation!
