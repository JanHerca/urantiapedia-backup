_France Tremblay_
Sherbrooke

Everyone goes their own way
This is your destiny
What's yours?
First of all mine

Your mission on this earth
Remains entirely
It is that of revealing
What is My Will

And what better way to get there?
Than learning to achieve
The multitude of Truths
That I taught you

Continue your work with Faith
Success is on the way
Listen carefully to the only Voice
The divine one that is in you!

Raise your vibrations
Stay in tune
Always be attentive
To all my instructions

The task is not easy
For a slender creature
But for a daughter of God
I remind you: anything is possible!

Leave your worries aside
These are bad habits
Which slow down your progress
Towards greater perfection

Keep practicing
What I taught you
Beauty, Goodness and Truth
Must be revealed

Broadcasting is your concern
But haven't you learned your lesson?
We are responsible for this creation
This decision is up to us.

To choose the right moment
Where all the parts are listed
Will be ordered
Everything is orchestrated

Nothing is left to chance
My creation is not a mess
But indeed a perfection
Which works in unison
