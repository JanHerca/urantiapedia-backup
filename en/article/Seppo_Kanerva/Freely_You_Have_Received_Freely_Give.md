The issue of money in connection with the activities, performed largely on the voluntary basis, of a movement of the type of the URANTIA movement is one that practically everyone has to come to terms with in his heart. Every one of us has, on moral and economic grounds, to determine whether to contribute something, and what is the scope of one's monetary involvement in the progress of the fifth epochal revelation. Jesus imparted the above quoted exhortations of freely giving at least three times. He did not refer to mere monetary contributions; he spoke about all types of activities in the furtherance of the gospel and the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus expounded a few times his views concerning a believer's rightful attitude toward wealth, toward amassing of riches and their use. I recall his detailed counsels to a rich Roman [[UB 132:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_8) - [UB 132:5.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_25)], his advice to the apostles [[UB 163:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_1) - [UB 163:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_7)], to his followers [1821:1 - 1823:1], and once more to his apostles [[UB 165:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p5_2) - [UB 165:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p5_7)]. Apart from the more lofty things, the apostolic corps needed also money in their ministry, and we are told about the frugality and organised fashion observed in the management of the apostolic funds. Jesus also reminded his followers of the importance of the material aspects in the work for the kingdom:

> “There is a great difference between wealth which leads to covetousness and selfishness and that which is held and dispensed in the spirit of stewardship by those who have an abundance of this world's goods, and who so bountifully contribute to the support of those who devote all their energies to the work of the kingdom. Many of you who are here and without money are fed and lodged in yonder tented city because liberal men and women of means have given funds to your host, David Zebedee, for such purposes.” [UB 165:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_5)

How to dispense one's riches and be generous can become a threshold issue. The recital about Matadormus, who wished to become a messenger of the heavenly kingdom but who was not ready to pay the price thereof, is a tragic instance of human shortsightedness. Matadormus's treasure was on earth, and even if he thought otherwise, he was not willing to do “what so ever,” in order to have his treasure in heaven:

> _“I will have you to be one of my messengers if you are willing to pay the price, if you will supply the one thing which you lack.” Matadormus replied: “Master, I will do anything if I may be allowed to follow you.” Jesus, kissing the kneeling young man on the forehead, said: “If you would be my messenger, go and sell all that you have and, when you have bestowed the proceeds upon the poor or upon your brethren, come and follow me, and you shall have treasure in the kingdom of heaven. When Matadormus heard this, his countenance fell. He arose and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.”_ [UB 163:2.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_5)

But we may also learn about an instance which was completely different in character, viz. about a widow who gave all that she had:

> _For a moment they sat down by the treasury, watching the people drop in their contributions: the rich putting much in the receiving box and all giving something in accordance with the extent of their possessions. At last there came along a poor widow, scantily attired, and they observed as she cast two mites (small coppers) into the trumpet. And then said Jesus, calling the attention of the apostles to the widow: "Heed well what you have just seen. This poor widow cast in more than all the others, for all these others, from their superfluity, cast in some trifle as a gift, but this poor woman, even though she is in want, gave all that she had, even her living._ [UB 172:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p4_2)

The apostle Matthew was equally generous; he, too, gave for the work of the kingdom practically all that he had, and though he many times felt the temptation to let others know about his generosity, he was able to quell this desire. The apostles, thus, never came to know of his generosity, save Jesus, who knew all about it. 139:7.8:

> _He [Matthew] gave practically the whole of his modest fortune to the work of the Master and his apostles, but they never knew of this generosity, saye Jesus, who knew all about it. Matthew ... knew his presence among them was more or less of a trial, he was strongly tempted to let them know that his funds often supplied them with their daily bread, but he did not yield._ [UB 139:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_8)

These recounts and teachings may be of guidance when each of us comes to think and ponder whether to donate funds, or give a contribution in the form of voluntary work for the benefit of any one of the numerous projects of the movement: translations, printings, travel expenses, mailings, article writing, study group hosting, and so on.
