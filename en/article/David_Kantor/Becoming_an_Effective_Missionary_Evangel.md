> . . . If you are not a positive and missionary evangel of your religion, you are self-deceived in that what you call a religion is only a traditional belief or a mere system of intellectual philosophy. . . . [[UB 160:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_3)] 

**Missionary,** Etymology: From the Latin missionem (nom. missio), meaning “act of sending” or mitto, mittere, literally meaning “to send” or “to dispatch”; the equivalent of the Greek-derived word “apostle” from apostolos, meaning “a delegate, specially, an ambassador of the Gospel; officially a commissioner of Christ [“apostle”]. Definition: 1. A person who works attempting to spread a religion or creed. 2. A religious messenger. 3. A person who knows something about the true worth of himself and others, who works to share that knowledge. 

**Evangel,** Etymology: From ecclesiastical Ancient Greek (euangelistes, “bringer of good news”), from (eu, “good”) + (angelein, “to announce”). Definition: 1. A person marked by extreme enthusiasm for or support of any cause, particularly with regard to religion. 

Are you interested in becoming a more effective “_positive and missionary evangel of your religion?_” Effective, economical outreach depends upon placing our message in the most relevant context for its assimilation as well as exploiting readily available, inexpensive, or free communication techniques. This article considers both of these matters. 

## The Primary Dissemination Context 

_The Urantia Book_ describes human religious development as a long-term evolutionary process which stretches across time from the first worship response of a primitive mortal to the experience of mortals living in an advanced epoch of light and life. Within this spectrum we find ourselves living at a point which sociologists of religion have termed the “post-Christian” era—an era of cultural evolution in which increasing uncertainty about the veracity of the Christian stories is undermining the incorporation of values illuminated by those stories in the lives of present-day men and women. 

For years, leadership in the Urantia movement has attempted to avoid associating the book with “New Age” religious activity—but this domain of activity has been perhaps the area of greatest religious ferment in the past half-century. Likewise, has leadership attempted to avoid any identification of the book with Christianity but Christianity represents a primary religious context within which the book’s teachings are highly relevant. 

Studies of past civilizations and cultures underscore the importance of their metaphysical stories and archetypes in providing a source of meanings and values which provide cultural integration and a basis for progress. The decline of civilizations and cultures is closely tied to loss of belief in the supportive stories, leading to a disintegration of the value-structure that makes civilization and culture possible. Our concepts of atonement, good and evil, revelation, intercession, sacrifice, prayer, confession, worship, survival after death, sacrament, redemption, purification, prophecy, and much more are derived from these stories and characters. Consider some of the primary underlying archetypes and stories which have provided the world view and moral foundations of western civilization: 

| Archetypes ||
--- | ---
Adam and Eve | Faith 
Lucifer | Prophecy 
Satan Guardian | Angels 
Melchizedek | Life after death 
Seraphim | The Kingdom of Heaven 
Heaven | The Apostles 
Hell | Jesus and the stories of His Life and Teachings 
Salvation | The “Second Coming” 

The art, music, literature, religion, ethics, and morality that have characterized Western civilization are drawn from these stories. And as the meanings of these stories continue to fade into mere mythological constructs, so do the values they perpetuate lose their potency as elements of cultural integration. 

Christianity today represents the state of the ideational stream that has flowed from ancient Sumerian civilization, through Egypt, the Hebrew tribes, into the Roman world, and on into the twenty-first century. In addition to revitalizing the archetypes and stories of this religious heritage, _The Urantia Book_ expands their depth of meaning and greatly enriches the potential for the illumination of higher values. Consider the potential of the following, rooted in the archetypes and stories listed above, to become significant archetypes and stories of a future religious culture: 

| Archetypes ||
--- | ---
Van and Amadon | The Supreme Being 
The Planetary Prince | The Universe Ages 
Grandfanda | Evolution 
John the Baptist | God the Ultimate 
The Midwayers | The Absolutes 
Ellanora | The Seven superuniverses 
The Universe Mother Spirit | Paradise 
The Seven Master Spirits | Havona 
Additional Levels of Fatherhood | Universe Ascent
The Characters of Michael’s previous bestowals | The Mansion Worlds—and there are many more.

The primary methodology which the revelators are employing is that of reinforcing and illuminating currently recognized symbols and stories, and then enriching that symbol base by expanding the range of archetypes it encompasses. Melchizedek based his work upon the teachings and methods of the earlier Sethite priests of the second garden. Jesus took over the work of John the Baptist and developed his presentation of the gospel message by evolving what John had already started—he then focused on the transformation of meanings attached to the prevailing stories and symbols in the religious culture of his time. 

_Wouldn’t it be prudent for us to deploy a strategy for dissemination that took these patterns into account?_ There needs to be a starting point, a point of entry into the larger field of global religious concepts. There are really only two choices here—either use an existing point of entry, or create a new one. Financial and administrative issues immediately emerge; and we must look at the time each approach would require to bear fruit. 

The revelators describe the Christian church as “_the cocoon in which the kingdom of Jesus’ concept now slumbers._” They go on to say that, “_The kingdom of the divine brotherhood is still alive and will eventually and certainly come forth from this long submergence, just as surely as the butterfly eventually emerges as the beautiful unfolding of its less attractive creature of metamorphic development._” [[UB 170:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_21)] The Master himself has, “_in every manner consistent with his nature, fostered it as the best existent exponent of his lifework on earth._” [[UB 195:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_9)]

_How might we more responsibly and creatively support this process which the Master has been fostering for some 2,000 years?_

_The Urantia Book_ provides frequent critiques of Christianity, frequent comments about the need to propagate the teachings of Jesus. It has a theological cosmology constructed from the best developments within the Christian theology of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One of the greatest theological achievements of the book is an integration of the two primary streams of twentieth century Christian theology— Process Theology and Trinitarian Theology. 

The Spirit of Truth “ . . ._was bestowed for the purpose of qualifying believers more effectively to preach the gospel of the kingdom_ . . .” [[UB 194:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_5)] “_Though the Spirit of Truth is poured out upon all flesh, this spirit of the Son is almost wholly limited in function and power by man’s personal reception of that which constitutes the sum and substance of the mission of the bestowal Son._” [[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)] “. . . _the Spirit of Truth… is designed to live in man and, for each new generation, to restate the Jesus message_ . . .” [[UB 194:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1)] 

The seraphim function within groups and within interpersonal relationships facilitating the appearance of the brotherhood of man. The Thought Adjusters work to orient their mortal subjects toward the Father in a manner identical to the primary thrust of the teachings of Jesus—these primary spiritual forces are focused on reinforcing and illuminating the meanings and values of Jesus’ bestowal. 

_How might we more responsibly and creatively work in conjunction with these forces for planetary spiritual cultural renewal? _

Whether or not western civilization is in decline is not a matter of significant controversy. The real questions involve how deep the retrogression will be and the nature of the stimulus that eventually leads to renaissance. Here again, the importance of Christianity should not be overlooked. The Christian church has an infrastructure of communication, education, and service already in place which extends into every country and linguistic group on the planet. It has a strong cultural ethic of outreach, evangelism, and compassionate service. It is the only world religion which has evolved a significant critical theological enterprise. Most importantly, it is based on the stories, beliefs, and archetypes which _The Urantia Book_ illuminates, revitalizes, and expands. 

_Doesn’t this tell us something about the context within which we might most responsibly and creatively work toward the stimulation of a global spiritual renaissance?_ The archetypes and stories of Christianity still inform the religious beliefs of the largest grouping of people on the planet. The following shows the percentage of world population espousing specific religions (from _Encyclopedia Britannica_): 

Religion | Percentage
--- | ---
Christianity: | 33%
Islam: | 21%
Non-religious: | 16%
Hinduism: | 14%
Indigenous religions: | 6%
Chinese traditional: | 6%
Buddhism: | 6%
Sikhism: | 0.36%
Judaism: | 0.22%
Other: | 3.42%

An argument frequently offered is that we should avoid making the book or our community look too “Christian” because it might turn away adherents of other faiths. This argument represents a common marketing mistake—attempting to appeal to too broad an audience and thus lacking sufficient relevance for anyone in particular. It results in a failure to construct an appeal to our largest potential market out of fear of alienating smaller market segments. 

Shouldn’t we be trying to introduce the perspective of _The Urantia Book_ into the existing infrastructure of Christianity, leveraging its highly developed internal communication, education, and dissemination mechanisms for the purposes of the revelators? Is it unreasonable to think that if the revelation could be assimilated into Christianity, the superior infrastructure of the Christian church could become a means by which the revelation could permeate into other world religions? 

## What can you do in your local community? 

Let’s return to the question posed at the beginning of this paper: Are you interested in becoming a more effective “_positive and missionary evangel of your religion?_” Even if you are not in accord with the views expressed above about Christianity as the primary group to which the book should be presented, there are many things you can do which require only your committed time. Here is a partial list: 

1. Start a Study Group. 

2. Submit comments to blogs. 

3. Write a review for Amazon.com. 

4. Write reviews for other web bookstores. 

5. Create pages at social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace—list _The Urantia Book_ as your favorite book; search these sites on the word “Urantia” and make contact with other people who list the book as their favorite. 

6. Create a MeetUp group and contact other readers in the system. 

7. Create a simple website focused on a single topic—create backlinks to Fellowship and other Urantian websites; learn how to optimize it for top search engine responses. 

8. Join and participate in religious discussion boards such as BeliefNet. 

9. Monitor and participate in Urantian discussion forums such as those at TruthBook and UBRON. 

10. Join YouTube; search on the term, “Urantia” and respond to comments made by online viewers of Urantian videos. Check in on a regular basis. Post positive, upbeat comments, avoiding contentious arguments. 

11. Submit articles to online magazines about your belief in God or your own personal religious experience. 

12. Stop arguing with other readers online and start talking to the world! 

13. Write for the world, not just for online reader forums. Use reader forums to try and stimulate dissemination efforts and projects. 

14. Submit articles to local newspapers; send letters to the editor when appropriate. 

15. Write book reviews or essays and submit them for publication in appropriate local newspapers and magazines. Freebie publications such as the local events newspapers distributed at supermarkets, health food stores, car washes, and other local venues often are very happy to receive contributions of well-written articles. 

16. Submit an article on a Urantian topic to the Religions section of your local newspaper. 

17. Participate in local fairs and expos. 

18. Check your local bookstores frequently for _The Urantia Book_. If it is in the “Occult” section, talk with the manager and point out that it is classified as a religious book and should be in the “Religions” or “New Age” sections. If it is not in the bookstore, ask why, pointing out that it is a spiritual bestseller with more than 800,000 copies in print in multiple languages. Offer to provide them with a free copy to prime the pump. If they accept, contact Paula Thompson at her email or phone and a book will be sent—Paula will need the name of the buyer as well as the address of the bookstore.

19. Write commentaries, create flash programs, powerpoint studies, etc., and submit them to the Fellowship, Truthbook, or other Urantian websites for publication. 

20. Keep a case of books in the trunk of your car and pray about their placement. (Thanks to Don Ware in Florida who distributes a case every three months with this approach.) 

21. Submit Urantian videos to YouTube. 

22. Be creative—several groups have volunteered to keep sections of local highways clear of litter resulting in a free roadside sign containing the name of their group which includes the word, “Urantia.” 

23. Create e-cards with Urantian sentiments for readers to use as greeting cards. 

24. Volunteer to help with projects at the Fellowship; we need volunteers willing to commit to specific projects extending over a period of time. 

25. Get involved in a local community of people who are interested in spirituality or religion—churches, synagogues, reading groups—to share ideas in a positive, non-aggressive manner. 

26. Do presentations in bookstores, local coffee shops, cafes, or any other available venue. 

27. Set up a book club at a local university or college―contact Don Green for more information. 

28. Place low-cost ads in local papers―get the word “Urantia” included in anything you publish. 

29. Place books in nursing home libraries, metaphysical libraries, Starbucks stores, cruise ship libraries, hotel libraries, military base libraries, retreat center libraries, book racks in beauty shops, dentist or doctor offices (just leave a book behind when you visit these places), hospital libraries, church libraries―any place where there is a captive audience. If you don’t have a book and find a place willing to accept one, send the contact information to Paula Thompson at the Fellowship and a complimentary book will be sent. 

30. Share your ideas, successes, and failures on internal readership forums. 

31. Make a commitment to provide long-term financial support for your favorite Urantian undertaking—a small monthly contribution sustained over a period of time—such as a Fellowship autodebit―can make a big difference. 

32. Provide financial support for organizations engaged in book publication, marketing, and distribution. 

33. Provide financial support for the Pipeline of Light which distributes books worldwide. 

34. Establish a program of ongoing personal education; the more familiar you are with the context in which you are attempting to work, the greater your chance of success. 

35. Post notes on public bulletin boards in post offices, laundromats, coffee shops, book stores, supermarkets, etc. A simple note―”Interested in _The Urantia Book_? Call nnn-nnn-nnnn” gets exposure for the word “Urantia” and creates a point of potential contact. Concerned about strangers in your home? Meet at a local coffee shop, library, or other public place. 

36. Download, print, and distribute materials formatted and available for such purposes on the Fellowship website. 

37. Participate in the work of a Fellowship committee as a member or an adjunct. 

38. Participate in the work of the General Council. 

39. Participate in the work of the Executive Committee. 

40. Become active in a local or regional Society; use this to mobilize local and regional dissemination projects. 

41. Serve as a TDA delegate. 

42. Pray for opportunities. Pray for wisdom. Use your imagination! 

To summarize, become an effective missionary evangel by cultivating an understanding of the context in which your message is being propagated and learn how to make it relevant to the greatest number of individuals at the lowest possible cost. A good rule of thumb is, when you want to introduce a new concept to someone, make sure that 80% of what you tell them is things they already know. Then make your new concept relevant to their existing concepts. Exploit the wide range of opportunities available in the contemporary environment. All that’s required is a commitment of time and effort. 

View _The Urantia Book_ as a missionary evangel’s toolkit; it contains instructions, a description of the cosmological context within which we are to work, statements of goals and objectives, exhortations to share the gospel of Jesus, and an account of the Life and Teachings of Jesus which the revelators tell us is to be the “_inspiration for all lives upon all Nebadon worlds throughout all generations in the ages to come._” [[UB 120:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_7)] The cosmology, theology, and history in the book provide important orientation for “_these new teachers . . . who will be exclusively devoted_” to the gospel of Jesus. [[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)] Thus has been delivered to us in _The Urantia Book_, a complete package for the stimulation of a planetary spiritual awakening—tools, resources and instructions. It contains a sufficiently clear description of the celestial forces working behind the scenes on this project to enable us to synchronize our efforts with theirs. Our challenge is to transcend personal prejudices and join the revelators in their quest to evolve a high spiritual culture on Urantia. 

May your adventure as an effective missionary evangel be sublime.
