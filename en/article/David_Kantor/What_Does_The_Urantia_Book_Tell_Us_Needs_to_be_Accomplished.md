It is very instructive to set aside all that we have learned about the origin of the revelation and the conjectured intentions of its authors and look at what the book itself has to say about the most important tasks at hand. If we go through the book and note every point where the authors suggest that we do some particular thing, we find ourselves with a list of tasks which can be divided into three major categories: 

1. Tasks related to personal spiritual growth. 
2. Tasks related to addressing the spiritual needs of our world. 
3. Tasks related to the improvement of world political and social conditions. 

The first category of tasks—those related to personal spiritual growth—are found throughout the book and are characterized by such quotes as:

> “God-knowing creatures have only one supreme ambition...” <a id="a44_60"></a>[[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3)]
> 
> “The great goal of human existence is ...” <a id="a46_45"></a>[[UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4)]
> 
> “The transcendent goal of the children of time...” <a id="a48_53"></a>[[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3)]

Because the Fellowship is primarily dedicated to the tasks in Group two, I will not list Group one tasks. Neither will I list Group three tasks, many of which may be found in <a id="a50_175"></a>[UB 52:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6), <a id="a50_214"></a>[UB 81:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6), throughout [Papers 70](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70) and [71](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71), and elsewhere in the text. Following are some of the Group two tasks noted in _The Urantia Book_. Had I included all of Jesus’ exhortations to the twelve the list would have been much longer.

It is instructive to review the comments made by Jesus in his post-resurrection appearances. The emphasis was always on the proclamation of the kingdom. If we go through his post-resurrection appearances and extract the action verbs from his comments, we end up with this list: 

&nbsp; | &nbsp;
--- | ---
Proclaim | Confirm 
Minister | Strengthen 
Go | Proclaim 
Pray | Love 
Serve | Go 
Proclaim | Be wise 
Give | Publish the good news 
Go | Trust your brethern 
Bravely go forth | Joyously go forth 
Meet new experiences | Reveal 
Open eyes blinded by tradition | &nbsp;
Draw close | Lead 
Serve | Proclaim 
Love | Go 
Feed my lambs | Minister to the sick 
Serve | Forgive 
Follow me | Serve me 
Go | Proclaim 
Preach the love of God and the service of man | &nbsp;
Carry this good news to all the world | &nbsp;  

_Could the major hope and concern of the revelators be any clearer?_ It should be obvious from the foregoing that the authors of _The Urantia Book_ place a very high value on the spread of the religion of Jesus in our world as quickly as possible. Over and over again it is indicated to us that this is a critical priority. It should also be noted that this exhortation was the major theme of nearly all of the Master’s post-resurrection appearances.
