Right from the beginning we have enjoyed the Six-OSix, and in time we have seen it expand, becoming more interesting, varied and professional. Lately articles with additional information have been published in Six-O-Six, articles not “strictly” deriving from _The URANTIA Book_. This has caused an uproar amongst some people.

As Neil Francey (co-editor of Six-O-Six) states:

“It appears that Six-O-Six has in recent issues weighted its articles and editorial comments to a particular interest group and away from a strict URANTIA Book discipline. Readers are now having to address a new direction. Is this publication continuing to assist readers evaluate new ideas providing greater insights and understanding? Is it meeting changing needs? As a result, is Six-O-Six enjoying and increasing appreciation by readers or is it becoming too general?”

Initial unrest about the contents of the Six-O-Six started with the announcement of the E-3 tapes. The message mainly dealt with the lives that we will live when we have passed the latter days of this millennium and moved into the next one with an expanded consciousness, in closer cooperation with our celestial friends. This is in line with _The URANTIA Book_.

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs (‘epoch’ = ‘New Age’) of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment” (<a id="a41_190"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

This will not just happen as part of the slow evolution as we have known it so far. At this crucial point in the evolution of our planet and of all mankind special techniques are applied to speed up the process.

> “The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal.” (<a id="a45_253"></a>[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7))

> “But you should not become discouraged by the apparently slow progress of the kingdom idea on Urantia. Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes in both the material and the spiritual worlds. The bestowal of Jesus as an incarnated Son was just such a strange and unexpected event in the spiritual life of the world.” (<a id="a47_384"></a>[UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14))

Events out of the ordinary often prove to be a stumbling block on Urantia.

> “Slavery to tradition produces stability and cooperation by sentimentally linking the past with the present, but it likewise stifles initiative and enslaves the creative powers of the personality. The whole world was caught in the stalemate of traditionbound mores when the Caligastia one hundred arrived and began the proclamation of the new gospel of individual initiative within the social groups of that day. But this beneficent rule was so soon interrupted that the races never have been wholly liberated from the slavery of custom; fashion still unduly dominates Urantia.” (<a id="a51_582"></a>[UB 66:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_2))

In light of the reality of sudden, drastic, far-reaching changes in the course of our evolution at this crucial time, we can certainly use guidelines and directions, even though we have _The URANTIA Book_. The last message received, concerning the release of _The URANTIA Book_, came in January 1955. A Being who identified himself as Norson made the following statement: “I am a Melchizedek. I am Planetary Prince of Urantia. While I am not positive that now is the time to publish these Papers, you may publish them if you receive no further communications from me before the first of October of this year.”

_The URANTIA Book_ revelation has been given out ahead of its time and because it is incomplete and partial in itself, additional revelation and information are presently given. In our opinion it is this information that has been shared in the newsletter. Of course this information has to be scrutinized and carefully assessed, but should not be rejected outright because some have no place for it in their comfortable, established mode of thinking. Much of this information is in accordance with _The URANTIA Book_, but it requires discipline and study, cross-reference reading, comparing, contemplating, consulting inner guidance, in order to come to some informed conclusion.

In regard to Neil's questions we can only positively affirm that the Six-O-Six has, as never before, stimulated the exploration of new ideas and concepts, all related to _The URANTIA Book_ concept. In fact, it has made _The URANTIA Book_ even more interesting and has given it an extended meaning, value and challenge.

There are many hints in _The URANTIA Book_ of great impending changes soon to occur. To pick a few:

* **Description of the perfect life**

* **Detailed textbook-like information about social, political, economical and spiritual structure in the future to occur on this planet.**

* **Scientific, astronomical information (revelation) to be applied once our system is fully reconnected with the rest of the Universe** (apparently this has recently occurred).

“The knowledge which man most needs for survival and the conquest of his environment, is scientific knowledge of his universe and a living philosophy which will unite all humankind in one brotherhood. The purpose in giving this new knowledge is to consummate a marriage between science and religion which will give to the world its peace, happiness and culture, that only full awareness of the divine light, which is within all men, can bring.”

* **Description of a neighbouring planet**

And the list can go on and on. It would be ignorant to place the actuality of this information into the far distant future.

**_The URANTIA Book_ is a “Fifth” Epochal Revelation** although given before its time, to those who are ready for it, long before its world-wide mission.

To quote 2 paragraphs from the Divine Letters Latent:

> 1. _The URANTIA Book_ is a feature of the progressive evolution of human society.
> 
> It is not germane to the **spectacular episodes of epochal revolution.**
> 
> The book **belongs to the era immediately to follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle.**
> 
> That will be the day when men will be willing to seek truth and righteousness.
> 
> **When the chaos** of the present confusion has passed, it will be more readily possible to formulate the cosmos of a new and improved era of human relationships.
> 
> And it is for this better order of affairs on earth that the book has been made ready.
> 
> 2. In the meantime thousands of study groups must be brought into existence. Thus will the Book be in readiness to **comfort and enlighten** the peoples of the world when **the battle for man's liberty** is finally won and the world is once more made safe for the religion of Jesus and the **freedom of mankind**.

As for our changing needs — additional new information emphasises the importance of our spiritual growth. To get close to our Thought Adjuster, the divine I AM presence within, by means of daily meditation, prayer, worship and actually living it.

We have to be on guard not to fall into the trap of over-intellectualizing the teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ to the detriment of the spiritual message it contains. There is a lot we don't know. Don't assume, but discriminate and master it.
