_By Gábor Cseh, Hungary_

The 2011 spring book fair was a most important event because it was the first opportunity to publicly present the Hungarian translation of _The Urantia Book_ to the Hungarian people.

Visitors to our booth were not only able to page through the Hungarian translation, which was printed in the second half of 2010 , but they were also able to peruse the pages of the English, Finnish, French, Italian, and Spanish translations. Naturally, the Hungarian version drew the biggest consumer interest. During the four day fair, more than one hundred inquiring individuals were given information about the contents and nature of the book. In addition to the short descriptive informational flyer and a collection of quotations, inquirers were also given a translated version of The Gift of Revelation and The Birth of a Revelation.

This event was made even more memorable by the meeting of new readers with older ones, individuals who have been diligently studying and disseminating the truths revealed in _The Urantia Book_.

The setting of this event — books containing truths, partial truths, and erroneous beliefs, amidst a book containing the truths of the Fifth Epochal Revelation reminded me of the days of the Urmia lectures, when and where, amidst the various teachings of truths, partial truths, and erroneous ideas, there was heard the truth filled words of the Fourth Epochal Revelation proclaimed by the incarnate Son of God and the Son of Man in the likeness of mortal flesh.

Our impromptu meetings with book sellers and agents of book distributors will undoubtedly enhance our efforts to distribute the Hungarian translation in Hungary.

The presentation of the book at this fair would not have been possible without the help and support of the Finnish, Canadian, and Hungarian readers.
