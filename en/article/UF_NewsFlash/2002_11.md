_A monthly News Bulletin from Urantia Foundation to IUA Officers, Foundation Office Managers, Coordinating Committee members, Foundation Representatives, Translators, and other readers for the purpose of disseminating this information to readers in local areas._

## Seeds Take Root in India

We have reported previously on dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ in India by a Foundation Representative who has placed over 3,000 books in libraries throughout India and hundreds more in other Asian countries. We have also reported on our a ttenda nce at several Indian book fairs where we have begun to reach out to this democracy of over one billion inhabitants, the second most populous country in the world.

English is one of two official languages of India, among the over 1,500 languages and dialects spoken there. The predominant religion is Hindu, which the _The Urantia Book_ indicates _“has proved to be the most adaptive, amorphic religion to appear on Urantia. It is capable of almost unlimited change and possesses an unusual range of flexible adjustment....”_ (<a id="a36_363"></a>[UB 94:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p4_8))

These efforts have generated considerable interest in _The Urantia Book_, and now we are being presented with an unprecedented opportunity. We are delighted to report that we are about to take the next step in providing _The Urantia Book_ to the Indian population in partnership with a 300-year-old nonprofit ecumenical society that is one of the leading publishers of Christian material in India, the Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (ISPCK).

We have reached an agreement with ISPCK to print and distribute a special edition of _The Urantia Book_ in India. The book will be stitch-bound and will be about two inches thick with a vinyl, leather-look hardcover displaying the concentric-circles symbol in gold foil. It will have rounded comers and a bookmark ribbon and will include the Keyword Index. A very handsome book for under $5.00!

_The Urantia Book_ will be distributed in Christian and secular bookstores throughout India at a subsidized price of 100 Rupees ($2.00). In addition, we have agreed to give away 6,000 copies each year as gifts to theological students graduating from Christian seminaries throughout India. The book will form a part of their personal reference library as they begin their work as pastors and priests serving the people of India.

What an impact this could have! We have embraced this opportunity knowing the potential effect these programs could have in uplifting our world. However, we will need considerable help to carry out these ambitious plans. We invite you to participate in this project by earmarking contributions to help subsidize the below-cost sale of the book in the Indian market or to provide gift books to Indian theological students. We hope that you will share our excitement at this chance to make a difference in India.


## Books Available for Library Placement!

Over the past fifty years, Urantia Foundation has given away thousands of books to libraries as part of its mission to make _The Urantia Book_ widely available. The Foundation incurs substantial expenses for the Library Placement Program, not only in direct product costs, but also in staff time to individually process these orders and shipping costs for each individual shipment of this 2097-page book.

As the amount of activity grows, the Trustees feel it is imperative to stream.line the process and to work in partnership with readers involved in this area of service rather than depending upon staff to process each individual library order. We are therefore introducing some changes in this process in order to facilitate the involvement of readers in carrying out local library placements in cooperation with their nearest branch office of Urantia Foundation.

Under the new program, individuals may now purchase cartons of books at a discount rate to place in libraries. The new Library Placement Form is included on the following page. As the books are placed, we ask that you fill in information about the library that we can add to our database. When the completed form is returned to Urantia Foundation additional discounted books may be ordered.

Often libraries will provide a receipt for the book donation to enable the giver to take a tax deduction for their contribution.

We will continue to accept donations earmarked for library placement to continue serving those libraries that cannot be served by this policy and for gift books for the indigent and other gift book programs which readers wish to support. Our goal is to have all “free” books financed by donations so that we can further concentrate on the many additional programs needed to reach out to the world.

## World Library Placement Policy

**(November 2002)**

Because the Foundation subsidizes the costs of books provided under this policy,we ask that you agree to use these books only for library placement and not for personal or commercial purposes. We are selling these books to you on the honor system and trust that you will use them for library placement only. **Often libraries will provide a receipt for the book donation to enable the giver to take a tax deduction for their contribution.**

## Nashville Trade Show

Ingram Book Company, Urantia Foundation's largest U.S..and international distributor, invited Urantia Foundation to display its products at their Fall Publishers Showcase in Nashville, Tennessee in August The show was to give their “in house” buyers, bookstore owners, and librarians a hands-on look at the books available through Ingram. Ingram's main offices and distribution center is located in Nashville. Members of Ingram's staff responsible for the formation of their new “niche market” catalogs (for both web and print) were also brought in to actually see the products they are listing.

The buyers from the Foreign Orders department were very eager to see _The Urantia Book_. They advised us that there has been a large increase in orders from Asia and India in the past year, and they appreciated this opportunity to satisfy their curiosity regarding the book. They normally do not see the contents of the books they sell because they simply pull up the ISBN bookcode number and place a warehouse order for their bookstore customers. Readers who have supported the Foundation's concentrated efforts in Asia and India over the past four years should be happy to hear this good news of the fruits of their labors.

## The Matthew Project

**A Funding Program to Ensure _The Urantia Book_ and its Teachings Reach the World**

> Matthew was the fiscal agent of the apostolic corps. It was his duty to see that the budget was balanced, tire treasury replenished. If the funds for mutual support were not forthcoming, if donations suffident to maintain the party were not received, Matthew was empowered to order the twelve back to their nets for a season. But this was never necessary after they began their public work; he always had sufficient funds in the treasurer's hands to finance their activities. (<a id="a121_479"></a>[UB 138:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_6))

Like the apostle Matthew who was given the task of securing the funds to finance the work of Jesus and the apostles, the Matthew Project is committed to developing the resources needed to support the mission entrusted to Urantia Foundation for the fifth epochal revelation. Over the past few years they have been working quietly and steadily toward that goal.

The Fall 2002 _Urantian News_ provided information about the project and the individuals participating in this work. These friends of the revelation would like to take this opportunity to begin providing additional details about the Matthew Project for our key supporters. We will therefore plan to include regular updates in Newsflash! about its progress.

For more than four years this group has been quietly developing a comprehensive campaign to ensure Urantia Foundation is able to continue to fulfill its mission. This is the largest fund development program ever undertaken by Urantia Foundation. We have now received lead gifts of over one quarter of the goal, which allows us to proceed to the next phase.

Those assisting with the Matthew Project meet at least twice a year. At a fruitful meeting this past October, members decided to extend their invitation to discover the “divine alchemy” of involvement with this important project to a larger circle of supporters. They will be calling on you to seek the gift of your creative energies in ensuring the long-term success of Urantia Foundation's mission.

If you would like to learn more about the Matthew Project please contact Tonia Baney or Jay Peregrine at Urantia Foundation. They can provide you with additional information and put you in contact with the Friends of the Matthew Project.

## El Libro de Urantia in Spanish-based Internet Store

Urantia Foundation recently reached an agreement with Random House-Mondadori to distribute _El libro de Urantia_ through their Mexican-based, Spanish-language website. Random House is prominently displaying the book on its home page at http://www.randomhousemondadori.com.mx . This is the first major Spanish-language book website to carry _El libro de Urantia_. We expect this event to break the language barrier that prevents many readers from ordering the book from websites such as Amazon.com that sell Spanish books but only display ordering information in English.

Under this new agreement, Random House will be selling the book at a very low price (the best in all the Spanish-speaking world). They also agreed to offer a 25% introductory discount and free shipping to Mexico and Central America for the first month.

Random House's Mexico retail Internet operation can ship books anywhere in the world, so the availability of low cost books through this website can benefit all Spanish-language readers. However, the shipping costs to areas outside of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean still remain fairly expensive (similar to Amazon.com). We will continue to look for other shipping options for South America and Spain so that _El Libro de Urantia_ will be available in all countries at a reasonable price. If you have need of Spanish books, consider using this new and inexpensive website, and pass along this good news to your Spanish-speaking friends.

## Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS)

In September UBIS commenced its third semester of the year, sponsoring Internet-based classes conducted in English, French, and Spanish. The courses offer study on various topics in The Urantia Book and course work is submitted by email, thus freeing participants of the limitations of time zones or geographic location. Through the use of teaching questions, students and facilitators learn from one another through their shared experience of the teachings. This semester's courses included:

**A Study of The Supreme**

**Polly Friedman, Teacher/facilitator**

An overview of the four Papers on The Supreme Being (Papers [115](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115)-[118](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118)) including the definition, nature, expression and evolution with emphasis on the Supreme's relationship to the Universe, the Trinity and the individual.

Polly has long been a dedicated student of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, and the Supreme Being has been a favorite area of study for her over the years. She brings to the UBIS her long experience as a career teacher and Family Counselor, and she exemplifies the philosophy that Jesus so beautifully pointed out to Ganid: _“The true teacher maintains his intellectual integrity by ever remaining a learner.”_ (<a id="a151_416"></a>[UB 130:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p3_7))

**The Divine Perfection Plans**

**Susan Bryner, Teacher/facilitator**

The foundation for this course is found on <a id="a157_43"></a>[UB 7:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_1): “The Divine Perfection Plans,” which states: _The Eternal Son is in everlasting liaison with the Father in the successful prosecution of the divine plan of progress: the universal plan for the creation, evolution, ascension, and perfection of will creatures._ One could rather justifiably state that the following two thousand pages of _The Urantia Book_ are a revelation and in-depth explanation of this stupendous plan. The purpose of the course is to study its design and to appreciate its grandeur. The Papers selected to study are [36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36), [110](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110), [21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21), and [8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8).

Susan is an Educational Psychologist and teacher, and she has been a devoted reader since the early 80's. She made her first contact with other Urantia Book readers in one of our UBIS courses in 1999, and we were happy to find her! She is a wonderful teacher, and she volunteers her services on the UBIS Board.

**The Lucifer Rebellion**

**Al Lockett, Teacher/Facilitator**

This course is a study of Papers [53](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53), [54](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54), [66](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66), and [67](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67) with some supplemental reading from Papers [35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35) and [50](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50). It begins with a perspective on the Lanonandek Order of beings, goes on to the roles that Lucifer and Satan played in the Rebellion, examines the themes behind the Rebellion, and will discuss how its ramifications may still affect our planet.

Many of you may remember Al's presentation at the 2000 Conference in New York. He inspired us all with his infectious enthusiasm of spirit and his obvious devotion to social service. Al was the first person to respond to the UBIS's initial call for Teacher/Facilitators back in 1999, and he has given several courses during these past three years. We are grateful for his steadfastness in service to others, and for his participation on the UBIS Board. Al is a Computer Programmer and musician.

**The work behind the UBIS is ongoing,** as we continually plan for the future. While we wait for our"core teacher” group to grow and learn and develop, we continue to gather experience. The UBIS Seminar this past summer was productive in many ways. The UBIS board has completed work on an extensive Teacher's Handbook that should be a great help and guide to the new Teachers/Facilitators. Soon we will be sufficiently large to begin planning a curriculum, and we are examining ways to extend the present format.

Many of you are aware that there are many different educational outreach efforts going on around the world, and the UBIS is one of them. Much good work is in progress, taking form and shape in a variety of ways. The UBIS is unique it that its service effectively reaches those who may not have the opportunity to come in contact with other readers. And perhaps the most meaningful part of this project is the learning experience it offers the Teacher/Facilitators. Seppo Kanerva put it very well (in one of his essays) when he reminded those who say they aren't ready to take on the assignment of being a teacher, that no one is perfect, therefore no one can be the perfect teacher. But he goes on to say that, _“We must not forget that to share one's experiences, expertise, skills and endowments is godlike—divine. Sharing is godlike—divine.”_ (<a id="a171_847"></a>[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1))

The UBIS project is one of sharing one's self with others and an opportunity for service. Come join us in a class and see if this is a service that you might be able to participate in. Course descriptions for the January 2003 session will be posted on our website December 15.

## Trustee Information Update: Kwan Choi

On August 23, 2002, the Court issued an opinion regarding the removal of Kwan Choi from the Board of Trustees of Urantia Foundation. The Court ruled that the removal was defective as a result of a technical deficiency in carrying out the removal procedure. The Court therefore granted Kwan Choi's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and denied the Motion for Summary Judgment by the remaining Trustees.

In the meantime, the remaining trustees have again voted unanimously to remove Kwan Choi at special meetings called for that purpose and at their regular quarterly meeting in October, 2002. Dr. Choi continues to object to each of the votes as being invalid.

The issue before the court involved the interpretation of Urantia Foundation's Declaration of Trust and Bylaws. Following the initial, unanimous vote to remove Kwan Choi as a Trustee on September 7, 2001, the By-Laws called for additional votes to take place at the next three quarterly meetings of the Board on October 20, 2001, January 19, 2002, and April 20, 2002.

The wedding of one Trustee's daughter occurred on October 20, 2001, and so a request was made to reschedule that meeting to the following weekend, October 26, 2001. Kwan Choi indicated he had a previous commitment on October 26, and so the meeting was rescheduled to November 10, with notice to all of the Trustees. Kwan Choi attended the November 10 meeting with his attorney. The Trustees voted to remove Kwan as a Trustee at the November 10 meeting and again at the meetings on January 19 and April 20, 2002.

The Court found that, although meeting dates may be changed by agreement of the Trustees, because Kwan Choi did not consent to change the meeting to November 10, the removal vote cast on that date was invalid. The Court held that the removal process was, therefore, defective and not in compliance with the By-Laws.

It should be noted that the provisions of the Declaration of Trust (DOT) and the By-Laws differ regarding the requirements for removal. The DOT provides that a Certificate of Removal shall be recorded following a single, unanimous vote for removal by the remaining Trustees.

The DOT is also clear that it only authorizes By-Laws to be enacted that are consistent with the DOT. Although the By-Laws provide for additional votes at three consecutive quarterly meetings, the Board of Trustees have consistently understood this to mean that the initial vote effects removal and the additional votes allow a time-delay for possible reinstatement. Therefore, they believe that after an initial, unanimous vote for removal, one no longer has rights and duties as a Trustee unless reinstated in one of the three additional votes required by the By-Laws. We believe that to interpret the By-Laws as requiring the Board to have additional votes to effect removal than what is prescribed by the DOT incorrectly subordinates the DOT to the By-Laws. The DOT and case law are clear that the DOT, not the By-Laws, are controlling in the event of a conflict.

In the current case, however, the Court has held that one continues to serve as an active Trustee and retains the right to vote even after the initial, unanimous vote for removal until all of the provisions of the By-Laws have been complied with. Hence, the court held that because Kwan Choi did not vote to move the meeting date to November 10, the vote taken at the rescheduled meeting was ineffective.

Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.


## Urantia Foundation's Response to Anonymous Letter

_By Tonia Baney_

November 9, 2002

For over fifty years Urantia Foundation has persevered in spreading _The Urantia Book_ teachings throughout the world through our comprehensive translation and distribution activity. We have supported a growing group of devoted readers in the organization of a fraternal service group, which supports us in our goals, and which is worldwide in its scope. In short, we have faithfully expanded the work started by our early leaders, and for which Urantia Foundation was created.

Recently a number of readers have received anonymous letters, which are full of harsh criticisms of the Foundation Trustees and some staff. Although the writers purport to support Urantia Foundation, the letters are replete with distortions. Contrary to some of the accusations, the Trustees have not violated the Trust, nor have they profited due to their position as Trustees. We are all human beings, not one of us is perfect, but in spite of our imperfections, we at Urantia Foundation have been consistent in our purpose and efficient in our results.

Urantia Foundation finds itself falsely accused by an anonymous group of individuals who spread misleading information, and make groundless allegations in an attempt to undermine the Foundation's efforts to carry out **its trust,** instead of using this same energy and resources in the constructive spreading of the Urantia teachings.

These latest letters are in line with other anonymous mail directed to a Trustee of Urantia Foundation that sought, through threats, to reverse the decision of the Board of Trustees regarding the removal of Kwan Choi as Trustee. They are the same as complaints to various officials by Martin Myers, a former Trustee, who recently provided Kwan Choi with a supporting affidavit that was filed with the court, which considered the removal of Kwan Choi from the Board of Trustees. These complaints are similar to other “anonymous” and “confidential” sources that, through the years and up to the present time, have complained to the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Judge, or other officials in an attempt to disrupt the operations of Urantia Foundation and to wrest control from its Board of Trustees.

There is nothing new in any of these complaints. However, we understand that these kinds of allegations may upset some readers, and this concerns us deeply. We assure all readers that we are devoted to fulfilling the rolecreated for Urantia Foundation, which is to perform a service of trust for the benefit of the peoples of our world outlined in the Declaration of Trust. We thus welcome the opportunity to address any reader's concerns at any time.

The issues raised by these and other complaints have been evaluated by officials responsible for proper financial and organizational procedures of nonprofit organizations, including the Illinois Attorney General and the Internal Revenue Service. Urantia Foundation takes such issues seriously, and responds promptly to questions or allegations regarding its financial management For example, when Mr. Choi began to make allegations of financial wrongdoing only after his fellow Trustees requested that he resign from the Board, Urantia Foundation immediately notified the Attorney General's Office and offered to provide any information needed to evaluate these claims. Neither the Attorney General nor the Internal Revenue Service has ever found one instance of wrongdoing on the part of the Urantia Foundation.

In the Choi lawsuit, Mr. Choi sued the Trustees and the Attorney General and accused the Trustees of financial maHeasance. TheChief of Compliance with the Attorney General's Office filed an affidavit stating that the Attorney General had found no need to take corrective action against Urantia Foundation

Both the Foundation's Treasurer and its Finance Manager are Certified Public Accountants. Urantia Foundation's financial management has been subjected to audits every year since its inception by independent, certified public accounting firms.

Copies of its audit reports and its Form 990 federal tax returns are available to the public upon request and for a small fee to cover copying and postage. The Foundation's tax returns are available free of charge on the Internet at [https://www.guidestar.org/](https://www.guidestar.org/).

Broad-based support for Urantia Foundation continues to increase, and we recognize the responsibility we have to continue earning the confidence and support of Urantia Book readers worldwide. Donations are properly accounted for and are used in accordance with the donor's desires. Our investments are closely supervised and are reported annually to the Attorney General's Office. No one profits, nor has ever profited, from these investments except Urantia Foundation

Earlier this year Urantia Foundation underwent a full Compliance Audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Compliance Audits are the most thorough audits conducted by the IRS on non-profit organizations. They are done about once a decade. On August 27, 2002, the IRS notified us of the results of their audit The IRS found that the Foundation continues to qualify for tax exemption, and that its tax return for the year ending December 31, 1999 was accepted as filed, with no amendments being necessary. When a Compliance Audit is done for a given year (1999 in this case), the preceding year and the following year are also examined, which means that Urantia Foundation passed the IRS's toughest audit for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000.

Urantia Foundation has already addressed most of the issues raised in the anonymous letter in past reader announcements and will do so in the Urantian News and Newsflash! We shall continue providing accurate information in a timely fashion, and responding promptly to requests for information

H you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. We shall be only too happy to address your questions in more detail. We want to respond to any concerns that you may have regarding the management of Urantia Foundation Please let us know how we can be of service.

Tonia Baney

Executive Director
