## Indian Seminary Students Are Receiving Copies of The Urantia Book

Across the Indian subcontinent, many seminary students and recent graduates are enjoying a new opportunity a chance to read and study a copy of _The Urantia Book_ received as a gift. Urantia Foundation is working with our Indian friends and partners at the Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (ISPCK) in Delhi in order to place copies of _The Urantia Book_ into the hands of thousands of students in every corner of India' s diverse geography from the sharp rise of the Himalayas to the humid tropics in the far south. We want to thank everyone who has helped to make this project a resounding success, and especially those generous individuals whose support has been crucial in getting it off the ground.

In late November, Foundation staff member Matthew Viglione traveled to Dellu to inspect the hand-stitched, gold embossed books printed in India for this program and to discuss ongoing plans with our colleagues at ISPCK. By then just over 2,300 books had peen given to students, and ISPCK staff estimated that another 1,500 books would be sent out by the end of the year. This means that in 2003, Urantia Foundation paid for almost 4,000 books that ISPCK distributed at no charge to those who received them. We are gratified and excited by these pioneering efforts half a world away, and we hope you will be too.

Reaching seminary students is not our only goal. Urantia Foundation believes in India and its people and would like them to have access to the revelation, just as we do. So Urantia Foundation is also distributing some of the books printed in India in normal retail channels at a subsidized price to ensure that many people are able to afford it. While in Delhi, Matthew traveled around India's sprawling capital to various bookstores that have begun carrying _The Urantia Book_ in their standard inventory.

Seeds sown over the years are bearing fruit, and the experiment of printing and distributing Tire Urantia Book in India is already showing its value. Urantia Foundation has received many reply cards and website queries from Indian readers who say they want to learn more and interact with other readers.

Since this first printing in India was experimental and rather small, books will soon be in short supply in Delhi. Our associates there believe that the original 6,000 books designated for seminary students will be exhausted by midsummer 2004. Therefore, we need to reprint the book very soon so we can continue this gift book program.

During the past year, the remarkable actions and achievements of our Indian friends and associates have demonstrated their commitment. Now it is Urantia Foundation's turn to support their achievements by providing the tools the books they need to continue nourishing the fruit of so many years of careful sowing. In Samaria, Jesus told the apostles, _“the fields are already white for the harvest”_ (<a id="a44_400"></a>[UB 143:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p6_1)). Perhaps if he were here now and were to say that today, he could well be speaking of India. **But our work there has just begun, and we greatly need your support for the next printing of gift books for India.**


## Spanish Translation Gift Books

From time to time we have reported on the program for placing over 4,500 copies of the Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_ in libraries and institutions throughout Latin America. Coordinating this effort has been an enormous endeavor. Urantia Foundation Staff, Foundation Representatives, and nearly fifty volunteers in Mexico and Central and South American countries have been working on this project.

In addition to complex administrative, invoicing, and accounting work by Foundation staff, the project has required many hours of research on numerous aspects such as determining fair and appropriate quantities of books to be allotted to the different countries. It also has involved working with local nonprofit organizations and government officials to reduce import costs, and recruiting and coordinating volunteers who have been receiving and storing books.

Volunteers have worked diligently to help Foundation staff find efficient, reliable, and economical methods of distributing large quantities of books for noncommercial purposes. Each country has its own import regulations and library systems, which greatly complicates the coordination of this project. Our volunteers have spent many hours researching their national library systems in order to find the most efficient ways to place these books. They have also been preparing library directories and maps that will facilitate the actual placement of the books in each individual library. This has been a wonderful opportunity forSpanish speaking reader s to serve their local communities and plant valuable seeds for the fifth epochal revelation.

Foundation Field Representative Mark Bloomfield, who has placed thousands of books in libraries throughout India and in other Asian countries, is working with local volunteers to place books in Latin American libraries. His techniques are simple: He personally visits with librarians, explains the book, and highlights the value it could have in their country. These methods have proved highly effective.

Mark began this program of placing books in Latin American libraries in Mexico lastSeptember. Simultaneously Colombian readers began placing books in Colombia. The Urantia Association of Mexico is placing books in Mexican prisons that were supplied by Urantia Foundation under this program. As of mid-February, 700 books have been placed in Mexican libraries, 500 in Argentina, 260 in Colombia, and 100 in Uruguay. Readers in Spain have recently requested that Urantia Foundation conduct a library placement program in that country as well.

Urantia Foundation absorbs travel expenses and other volunteer expenses, as well as the costs for books, shipping, import duties, and the staff resources needed to coordinate this project. Because of a decline in large gifts, the Foundation's 2004 budget is very tight. The lack of funds could make it impossible for us to complete the project.

Sales of _El Libro de Urantia_ in Latin American have grown dramatically in the past few years. In fact, in the first ten years of publication, sales of the Spanish translation were ten times higher than the number of books sold from 1955 to 1965, the first ten years after _The Urantia Book_ was published. Latin America is ready for the revelation.

The books are in place and ready to be distributed. Urantia Foundation's Field Representative is in South America, and other volunteers are lined up and ready to go. We urgently need funds to allow them to continue.

## Funds Needed to Print the Translations into German, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish

The translators have completed their work to produce the first editions of new translations of _The Urantia Book_ in German, Lithuanian, and Portuguese. Further, stocks of the Spanish and Russian translations are running out, and we need to print new editions. Urantia Foundation now needs to commit the resources—staff and volunteer time as well as monetary resources—necessary to format, proofread, and set these books into print and to lay the groundwork for international distribution.

Experience has taught us that sales of the first printing of any translation tend to be slow, for Urantia Foundation needs to develop relationships with local distributors and bookstores and reach out to readers and associations who will help disseminate the newly printed text. After a period of time, native speakers who read a new translation often make valuable suggestions for smoother or more accurate wording, so that revisions seem appropriate or even necessary. The second edition can thus be a revised and improved version, and it is better not to have too many copies of the first edition left that must be sold before printing the second edition.

Since production costs increase substantially if small quantities of books are printed, the Foundation has been consulting printers who may be able to combine the Lithuanian, Portuguese, and Spanish translations in the same print run, for all three will use the same size paper. But the German translation cannot be combined in this way, for it will have a small column on each page containing the English text for reference alongside the German, and this requires a wider page format.

To find the most economical ways of doing all of these printings, we work with printers in different countries and consider a variety of factors, including printing costs, currency values, storage fees, shipping and import/ export costs. Volunteer proofreaders also help reduce costs. We cannot complete these projects without your help! And as always, we deeply appreciate contributions for any and all of these projects.

## The Dollar-a-Day Club

In December, Urantia Foundation began getting in touch with our friends and supporters to ask whether they would be willing to give $1 a day. If the Foundation received this amount from one-third of the people on our mailing list, we would raise $2 million a year. That would fund all the work that is currently underway and some new programs. The Foundation would have greater resources available to support dissemination and educational activities, translations, gift book programs, and worldwide distribution efforts.

Many of you already may have received a call from one of our Board members inviting you to become one of these faithful contributors upon whom we rely to ensure the financial stability we need to carry out all of Urantia Foundation's many programs. In response, a large number of you have authorized the Foundtation to debit your credit card $30 per month on an ongoing basis, an approach that provides critical financial stability so the Foundation can continue its work.

Many readers who have joined our _Dollar-A-Day_ club have told us that even though they have limited financial means, they can still afford $1 a day—especially if they make the effort to put it aside on a daily basis. One person told us that he drops a dollar into a jar when he empties his pockets at the end of each day. Many others have said that this is mainly a matter of making a choice and a commitment to “do their bit” for the revelation, not really a question of financial resources.

If you would like to join our Dollar-A-Day club, please give us a call (1-773-525-3319), email at [urantia@urantia.org](mailto:urantia@urantia.org), or visit [https://www.urantia.org/donate](https://www.urantia.org/donate)

## This Old House

It predates the first printing of _The Urantia Book_ by nearly half a century. It witnessed the formative Forum days. It raised families and organizations. And in case you are wondering, we are of course referring to Urantia Foundation's historic headquarters at 533 West Diversey Parkway in Lincoln Park, a neighborhood along Lake Michigan that is just north of downtown Chicago.

The three-story, gray stone building was constructed in 1904 and has served as the home base for Urantia activities ever since the papers first began to be received. The Viennese architects Fromann and Jebsen designed 533 in the high Art-Nouveau style. They filled it with stained glass windows, art glass light fixtures, and ornate wood carving, then capped it off by what one architectural guide calls “the best balcony on the north side of Chicago.”

Maintenance and conservation are constantly required for this masterpiece of architectural design. In recent years, generous volunteers have contributed their time and energy to help Urantia Foundation keep 533 in reasonable shape and remain a good neighbor in our local community. We are grateful to everyone whose efforts have extended from planting the flowerbeds in the spring and mundane painting and plumbing to such detailed and specialized endeavors as restoring stained glass windows.

As 533 moves into its second century, the work to maintain it may shift from simple repair to more ambitious projects that will be needed to maintain structural integrity and the architectural harmony that sets it apart from its immediate surroundings. After all, 533 is really a silent and unheralded partner in our efforts to keep _The Urantia Book_ available and promote the teachings, while also pursuing the other goals and objectives outlined in the Declaration of Trust Creating Urantia Foundation. The building provides space for meetings and for people from all over the world to gather. It is literally the focal point for all the Foundation's efforts. And like all other important members of our team, 533 needs our support!

Visitors are always welcome at 533, and as readers descend on Chicago for the International Urantia Association's biennial conference in late July, Urantia Foundation will offer everyone who wishes an opportunity to tour 533 and get a good look at the center of Urantia Foundation's worldwide activities. Whether or not you are able to visit this summer, Urantia Foundation's Building Program aims to keep the doors open for visitors now and in the years to come.

## Thanks to the Quiet Achievers

Volunteers give hours and hours of their time and energy to help Urantia Foundation with a myriad of tasks. Much of the Foundation's work depends on their efforts and could not be achieved any other way. The managers of our branch offices around the world, Foundation Representatives, and almost all active translators of _The Urantia Book_ provide their services free of charge. Other volunteers help us with such laborious tasks as proofreading _The Urantia Book_ before a print run, preparing mailings, and translating newsletters and other publications. Yet other skilled volunteers carry out various tasks associated with printing, translating, distributing, and protecting _The Urantia Book_.

These people work tirelessly and believe that the satisfaction of service is its own reward. Nevertheless, we would like to let them know how much we appreciate their work and dedication and rely on their quiet achievements. As Jesus told the seventy during their ordination: _“The harvest is indeed plenteous, but the laborers are few; therefore I exhort all of you to pray that the Lord of the harvest will send still other laborers into his haroest.”_ (p.1800, par. 5) We too pray for additional laborers since much remains to be done.

_Multi-linguists_

We have an increasing need for multi-lingual volunteers who can proofread the translations before they are printed and help translate and proofread other texts.

Many volunteers have limited financial resources and consider their voluntary work as a donation “in kind.” In practice, these contributions are just as valuable and necessary as financial assistance. If any of you who are reading this are willing to help, please let us know that you would like to serve the revelation in active partnership with us.

## Associate Trustees and Trustees Emeriti

In the last _Newsflash_ we announced that the Trustees of Urantia Foundation had appointed Carolyn Kendall, Nancy Shaffer, and Kathleen Swadling as Associate Trustees, in order to draw on additional resources of experience and wisdom as they make decisions. Since then the Trustees have also appointed Jane Ploetz, a longtime reader and supporter from San Diego, California, as an Associate Trustee. Jane and her husband John have long hosted a study group in their home, and for many years Jane has been active in International Urantia Association.

In addition, the Trustees have invited two former Trustees, Patricia Mundelius and Neal Waldrop, to serve as Trustees Emeriti. Like the Associate Trustees, Trustees Emeriti are consulted on many important issues and participate in periodic meetings of the Board of Trustees but are not entitled to vote.

As the Urantia revelation expands across the globe, the responsibilities of the Trustees and the Foundation's office staff are increasing. Our new team of advisors has brought diverse perspectives and is sharing some of the work.

## Aloha Steve and Tonia

_(The following was announced 19 October 2003)_

Dear friends of Urantia Foundation,

It is with sadness that we have accepted the resignation of Tonia Baney, Urantia Foundation's Executive Director.

Tonia has served the Foundation with distinction for over seven years. She started volunteering in 1990 as the chair of the Advisory Committee to the Trustees (ACT) and later as the head of the Coordinating Committee. Both of these volunteer organizations worked to establish the International Urantia Association.

In the spring of 1996, Tonia and her husband Steve accepted our offer to work at “533.”

Steve quietly and efficiently took over the organization and management of worldwide book fairs, distribution, mailing, and shipping.

Tonia began by analyzing the publishing business and nonprofit organizations. She led the Foundation in the creation and implementation of a comprehensive business, operation, and marketing plan that was instrumental in growing book sales, in more than doubling the size of the mailing list, in tripling annual giving, in increasing volunteers by 125 percent, and in moving the Foundation from a “mom-and-pop” organization to more of a multi-national establishment.

Tonia developed new fund-accounting systems, resulting in more efficient reporting of time and resources.

She created multiple newsletters, annual reports, and other journals. She managed a staff of ten, including the Coordinator for the International Urantia Association. As an accomplished speaker and presenter, Tonia also organized a comprehensive fund-raising group, the Matthew Project Team.

Tonia oversaw the publishing of eight new translations (those into Dutch, Korean, and Russian already published, and those into German, Italian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Swedish soon to be published) plus 10 more in progress (Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Estonian, Farsi, Greek, Indonesian, Japanese, Norwegian, and Polish).

It has been an active seven years, and we thank the Baneys for their extraordinary contributions. They deserve a well-earned rest. Steve and Tonia are returning to their family home on Maui, Hawaii.

Godspeed, Tonia and Steve Baney, good and faithful servants.

The Trustees of Urantia Foundation

## International Office Director — Mindy Williams

_(The following was announced 18 November 2003)_

Following the recent resignation of Executive Director Tonia Baney, the Trustees have asked Mindy Williams, the Office Manager of the Foundation office in Chicago, to assume most of the former Executive Director's duties under the new title of International Office Director. Mindy has agreed to accept this additional responsibility, effective immediately.

Mindy joined Urantia Foundation staff as Office Manager in 1999. She has 25-year experience in business administration, including expertise in the areas of marketing, human resources, legal matters, and technology. Before joining Urantia Foundation staff, Mindy served as the Technology Applications Manager for a firm with offices in Florida, United States, where she was responsible for computer systems, website, and technology training.

For the past four years, Mindy has been an integral part of Urantia Foundation's management team and has been actively involved in many different program areas. We are confident that Mindy and the experienced staff of Urantia Foundation will continue to faithfully carry out their myriad duties. We appreciate the service this excellent team renders each day to further the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ around the world and we ask that you please join us as we offer our encouragement and support to our International Office Director and the other members of Urantia Foundation staff in Chicago, Sydney, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, Quebec, Vancouver, and London.

## Eulogy for Baukje Begemann

Baukje Begemann

_by Carolyn Kendall_

Thirty-two years ago, Henry Begemann and his wife Baukje broached their idea of a Dutch translation of _The Urantia Book_ with two American visitors, Foundation Trustee James Mills and his wife Eunice. This was the spring of 1972, when Henry and Bauke (as she was known to American friends) were extending their cordial hospitality to Jim and Eunice at their large, comfortable home in Wassenaar, the Netherlands. Henry, a retired insurance executive, shared his dream with Jim, and the two men explored the monumental task of portraying the supernal truths of _The Urantia Book_ in a different language. (At the time the only existing translation was the French version, _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_, a product of the dedicated efforts of Parisian Jacques Weiss.)

As a younger man, Henry zeroed in on many alternative religions and cults, but he rejected them all because they did not measure up to his innate understanding of what Deity is and should be. When Henry encountered _The Urantia Book_ he recognized it as genuine, vowing to dedicate the rest of his life to exploring its spiritual truths.

Henry's and Bauke's home had been their wartime abode during the dark years of Nazi occupation, but now they made it the warm and welcoming site of a long-term study group of friends and neighbors. They also raised their daughters in that Wassenaar home, the rear of which adjoined a picturesque canal.

Bauke Begemann was always gracious and motherly whether she was in her own home, a guest in another's, or traveling to a conference. But her home was her true element, a place where she often bustled about her kitchen preparing coffee and refreshments.

When Henry was appointed International Field Representative, he and Bauke traveled to many countries to encourage the formation of study groups. Bauke was an excellent balance wheel who adjusted to Henry's often intense association with Foundation and Brotherhood leaders in the1970s and 1980s. She often calmed the waters.

Henry died in 1990, but Bauke and her daughter Nienke completed his meticulous translation. In 1998, _Het Urantia Boek_ was published.

Bauke Begemann passed on to the mansions on high on Thursday, January 22, 2004. She did so in complete serenity, suffused with faith in the Father's love and knowing she would next awaken in the ascendant life.
