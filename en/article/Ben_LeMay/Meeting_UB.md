My life has been a marvelous sequence of impossible dreams that have come true. Discovering _The Urantia Book_ is one of these impossible dreams. The book appeared in my life at a moment when I was desperately searching for satisfactory answers to crucial questions concerning my Christian faith.

One day, as I was visiting my home town, a good friend asked me to have a look at a strange book decorating her bookshelves which she could not decipher. It was the French edition of _The Urantia Book_. She loaned me the volume containing the “Life and Teachings of Jesus.” Later, with my mind well rested, I started to read this mysterious work. My first reaction was to throw it aside, as it appeared to be outside of the parameters of orthodox theology. But I continued reading and discovered expanding concepts which enhanced the basic tenants of my faith, and brought life and vitality to the historic realities of the life and teachings of Jesus.

I became so interested in the book's marvelous insights that I felt the need to underline certain passages and make notes in the margins, as I do with all my books. My friend would not permit me to do this; but after some hesitation, she allowed me to purchase the entire French edition from her. I avidly devoured this French edition and then the English text. Since this thrilling discovery in 1976, I have read both editions many, many times and will continue reading this great book all of my life.

I soon became anxious to meet with other ministers who were also readers of the book to discuss its teachings, and to prove to myself that I was not the only preacher engaged in this new adventure. The Chicago office of the Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_ informed me that on my next trip to Florida, I would have an opportunity to meet with a minister who had been reading the book for a long time, as he would be attending a conference in St. Petersburg. I had the great joy of discussing at length the many truth insights of _The Urantia Book_ with this pastor and many other seasoned readers of the book.

Over the years, _The Urantia Book_ has enhanced and clarified my faith in many ways. Even more, it has transformed my mind and life to new levels of effectiveness and service. I sometimes call it my “third rebirth.”

My dear friends, if you have not yet read this unique book, you should make every effort to do so. Do not be hesitant at its high price or be afraid of the great store of information in its 2097 pages. It will bring new meaning and joy to your life and revitalize your ministry!
