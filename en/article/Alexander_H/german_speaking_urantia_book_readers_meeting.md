Dear Urantia Community,

I want to report to you about the meeting of the German-speaking Urantia Book readers in Frankfurt, Germany last November 6-8. It was held, as usual, at Hotel Monopol, right in the city’s center. We had a great conference. It turned out to be a very effective study session over those three days.

The main topic was: “What happens after death?” according to _The Urantia Book_ of course. We studied Papers 47, 49.6, 55.2, 110.6-7, 112.3-7 and 113.6-7. We read together and discussed things in detail. I think I speak for everyone who attended when I say we are all smarter and wiser now – because we learn best when studying with one another. It felt good to see how well we interacted. Big thanks to organizer Christian Ruch for his diligence and hard work.

There were participants from all over Europe. It looked to me as if it was a Blue Club Meeting. The European Urantia Community may be small, but readers here are engaged and loyal. I wish to thank you all for that. And I hope we will all meet again in Budapest, at the European Blue Club Conference (September 15-18, 2016). There is a strong community developing in Europe and we are very happy and encouraged by this.

After the conference we held a meeting of the new association that was formed for German speaking countries two months before. It will be called “Urantia-DACH” (D=Deutschland, A=Austria, CH=Schweiz; Dach is German for “roof”). This Tri-national Association is now officially signed under Urantia Association International as a Local Association. This is a first step for the German speaking Urantia Community here in Europe, to make contact and interact with the rest of the international Urantia community.

The goals of Urantia-DACH are:

1\. To study and disseminate _The Urantia Book_ in German speaking regions.  
2\. To organize national and international meetings, conferences, seminars, etc.  
3\. To support activities here in Germany, Austria and Switzerland that promote study and dissemination of _The Urantia Book_.

We, the first fourteen signed members, voted and elected the officers of our new association: Christian Ruch, President; and Sandra Burgos-Cisneros, Vice President (both from Switzerland). They founded the association in September 2015. With them, Reinhard Schneider, (also from Switzerland) and Alexander H from Cologne, Germany, have been elected as a four person service team. I have also been voted to be the ambassador of Urantia-DACH.

All Urantia-DACH members also represent the Urantia Europe “Blue Club”. We extend this open invitation: Come, join us, at Budapest, Hungary, in September, 2016! This will be an international conference organized by the European Urantia Book readers with the theme: “Who is Jesus?” We are looking forward to this event and we hope there will be many attendees, and from many nations. Let us say, in Hungarian: “Wir freuen uns auf Euch!” or “Bízunk benne, hogy látni!” (according to Google Translator). More information about this event will be provided soon.

If anyone wants to do a presentation or a workshop at our Budapest Conference, please email [alexander@urantia.org.ua](mailto:alexander@urantia.org.ua)
