_The following talk was presented at the General Conference in Maine, August, 1987._

## “Everyday-Proof” Communion

Good morning, brothers and sisters:

Did you enjoy having a little talk with our heavenly Father this morning? Did you get refreshed, inspired and renewed? Are you conscious of his presence right now?

While living on Urantia Jesus had unbroken communion with our Father. The secret of this intense communion was prayer and worship. All the manifest and seen life of Jesus was based on restful meditation; it was rooted in his strong relationship with God.

## Asking For The Spirit and Other Good Stuff!

This is a combination of an eleven-day prayer cycle and a sharing of my insights into the relationship between the teaching of the Catholic Church regarding the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (listed in [Isaiah, chapter 11](/en/Bible/Isaiah/11)), the teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ about the seven adjutant mind spirits (<a id="a50_321"></a>[UB 36:5.1-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_1)), and the Pentecostal teaching on charismatic gifts of the Spirit ([I Corinthians 12:8-12](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/12#v8)). Of course the possible relationship between the seven gifts and the seven adjutants leaps to mind since the names are so close. Adding the charismatic gifts was a last minute bonus. I didn't think it possible, though I wanted it to be, Suddenly, they categorized themselves, as it were, and slipped into unexpected places. They took me by surprise!

The prayer cycle begins with Ascension Thursday and ends with Pentecost. The nine days between are the “novena” — nine days asking for the release of the Spirit. In the traditional novena, seven of the nine days are devoted to asking for a greater measure of each of the seven gifts. Here I have explained each gift, each ministry, and a little of each charism in hopes you will find ways to act to open yourself more fully to the Holy Spirit. We must always act. Faith like a mustard seed can do great things only if it is planted!
