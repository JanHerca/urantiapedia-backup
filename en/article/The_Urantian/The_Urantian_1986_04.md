## The Inner Conversation: Unbroken Communion With God

_The URANTIA Book_ asserts that the heart of religion is a living relationship with God. Such communion must not be limited to religious services or peak experiences. It should be habitual, an ongoing moment-to-moment process of inner sharing. One of the revelation's most startling pronouncements is that such Father-child communion can be constant. Continuous communion is attainable. Indeed, it is a methodological key without equal, a “secret” of great spiritual leverage.

_The following talk was presented at the Midwest Regional Conference, October 11-13, 1985._

## Spiritual Perspectives In The Workplace

When asked to give a presentation at this year's Midwest Conference, the idea of talking about the workplace in conjunction with spiritual perspectives almost immediately entered my mind. Consider the person who works a 40 -hour work week. Add to that 40 hours the time spent preparing for work, betting to and from work, and any extra meetings and conferences, In a typical week you have spent at least 45% of your waking hours in work-related matters. If you are self-employed, work overtime, or bring your work home, it is easy to approach 60% or more. The workplace occupies such a significant portion of our lives that I feel it to be quite worthy of discussion.

As it was for Rodan of Alexandria, so it remains for us today. Rodan said, “_The two major problems of life are: making a temporal living and the achievement of eternal survival. And even the problem of making a living requires religion for its ideal solution._” (<a id="a48_264"></a>[UB 160:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_1)) The daily problems we encounter in the workplace will be most easily solved if we can maintain a spiritual perspective or, as Webster defines perspective, “a view of things in their true relationship or relative importance.”
