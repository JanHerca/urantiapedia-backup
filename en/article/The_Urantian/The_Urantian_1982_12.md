## Actualizing The Supreme In Your Life

The Supreme is described in many ways. But in my mind I keep seeing him as the mysterious, all-seeing fetus, alive and forming in space at the conclusion of 2001. A God striving and active and, yet, restlessly incomplete. He is literally 'our God' — our simultaneously evolving Creator/creature. In him we have our origins and real significance, and in us he finds access to another facet of realizable experience — another avenue to the source of his being — the Paradise Father.

He steps through our steps, sees through our eyes, reacts to our thoughts and actions, and struggles inside of our struggles.

His substance surrounds us cocoon-like, forever influencing the environment within and without, like a spirit mother developing, laboring, and delivering a soul into existence.

Someday, the Supreme himself will be actualized born — and we'll be there to witness heaven rumble with God-Power as finite experience and infinite power fuse in eternity. The moment will arrive when we see through the eye of the Supreme with the insight of God himself.
