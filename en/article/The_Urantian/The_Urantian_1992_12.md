## The New Journal

_The Journal_ has expanded its mission to become a literary and artistic as well as a philosophical and investigative publication for readers of _The Urantia Book_. It will publish works of excellence related to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and chosen from submissions of readers throughout the world. Both content and quality will be considered by editors in choosing what to put into _The Journal_.

The publication's new format includes poems, artwork photography, and other forms of prose, including fiction, and a wider array of types of essays. In addition to philosophical prose, there can be scientific articles, speculative pieces based on issues in _The Urantia Book_, and a more far-ranging display of persuasive and expository pieces, including those previously printed in other publications, such as regional newsletters.

The artwork or photography chosen for the cover of each issue must be of especially high quality due to its prominence. Cover art is currently sought for the next issue, which will be published early this summer.

## Submitting Material

Everyone is invited to submit work to be considered for publication. But the following guidelines should be observed:

1. Do not send original poetry or essays; they will not be returned.
2. Limit the number of essays and all other prose works submitted to one or two. Length is an important consideration since this is not a long magazine.
3. Limit the number of poems submitted to just a few, preferably just one or two of your best, unless you have a series of three or four poems. Except in the case of a series or a related group, only one submission per person will be printed in an issue anyway. The creativity which went into putting together books of poems is admired, but it is better for the author to winnow a collection down to its best rather than to ask the editor to do it.
4. Original artwork will be returned if asked, but it is much better for the artist to have a high quality photograph made and then send that. If that is difficult, it is still wise to send a photo to be looked at rather than the artwork before knowing if it has been accepted for publication.
5. Photographs should be high-quality prints, preferably but not necessarily black and white, that are camera ready. They will not be returned. Again, generally only one from a photographer will be used in a particular issue, but others can be used in later issues.

With the help of the creativity of readers of _The Urantia Book_, The Journal will seek to publish excellence in art and thought as it relates to _The Urantia Book_ in its upcoming issues.
