_The following was the Keynote Address given at the 1983 Intensive Study Seminar._

## Prayer, Worship, And Communion

The experience of worship is a very basic part of the human religious life. Private and individual worship is an essential part of our lives. Public and group worship has often been a part of our experiences at conferences and in study groups. In this process, all of us have occasionally encountered controversy and mutual misunderstanding about the nature, quality, and significance of the group experience.

It is possible that we have not properly or fully applied the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ to understand and interpret the significance of these experiences. An educational program could be helpful in this area. Not merely a formal program directed at those of us who attend a summer workshop; but a general thread of thought and discussion that could flow from this to penetrate our study groups and “the movement” as a whole. Worship should be the arena in which we acquire and share the knowledge and experience of human brotherhood to its fullest, where we are not constrained or bound or influenced in any way by differences of race, creed, or philosophy.
