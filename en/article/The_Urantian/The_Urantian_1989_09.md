## Beyond Nondispute

In the eighteenth century, the British philosopher Hume felt that dialogues between reasonable people would become more fruitful if one could cut through the obstacles of different terminological systems. “Provided we agree about the thing,” he said, “it is needless to dispute about the terms.” Such nondispute is no longer a sufficient basis, if it ever was, for a positive dialogue capable of eliminating the deep-seated misunderstandings that draw many of us into disputes and violence. Especially in the case of interreligious discourse, which is turning out to be a crucial item on the modern world's agenda, we must make serious efforts to identify “the thing,” so that we not only cease “to dispute about the terms” but even begin to evolve a generally accepted mode of speaking and thinking of what “we agree about.”

> “_True religion is an insight into reality, the faith-child of the moral consciousness, and not a mere intellectual assent to any body of dogmatic doctrines. True religion consists in the experience that ‘the Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.’_” (<a id="a47_292"></a>[UB 101:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_13))
