URANTIA Book readers are aware of the outstanding performance of Van and Amadon during the seven crucial years immediately following the Caligastia betrayal of Urantia, One is deeply impressed with Amadon because of his sincere portrayal of total loyalty to his immediate associates and superiors who in turn remained loyal to Michael and our Universal Father. The out. standing leadership of Van and Amadon is attested to by their retention on Urantia for work after the translation of the thirty-nine remaining faithful members of the corporeal staff and fifty-five of their modified associates at the end of the seven years of uncertainty coincident with the arrival of the Melchizedek receivers.

Van and Amadon were to continue their labors here for about another 162,000 years or until shortly after the arrival of Adam and Eve, In their enterprises they were loyally assisted by a band of Andonites, originally eighty-eight in number who together with their descendants became known as Amadonites. Despite this name, a cultural-religious designation, they “_... were essentially Andonites._” (<a id="a38_399"></a>[UB 73:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1_3)) Beyond being informed of their presence in Dalamatia at the outbreak of rebellion, we know little of their level of education, intellectual, or religious development. We know they were totally mortal, hence by our present day concepts, relatively youthful, in all probability. We can assume they were quite primitive and short-lived.

If we compare them with the members of the corporeal staff of the prince and their original one hundred modified Andonite associates, startling differences appear.

The one hundred members of the corporeal staff were material but superhuman beings whose souls had been transplanted into human bodies fabricated for the purpose, and into which had been implanted a portion of the life plasm taken from each of one hundred Andonite donors. Previous to arrival on Urantia they had been provisional citizens of ascendant status on Jerusalem and had been personally selected by Caligastia. One fact stands out. None had fused with their Adjusters. Each was a one-time mortal, and none were from the same planet,

At the time the one hundred Andonites donated a portion of their life plasm, the Life Carriers introduced into each Andonite donor body... “_the complement of the system circuits..._” (<a id="a44_185"></a>[UB 66:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_14)) This was a very practical consideration. It enabled these modified Andonites to live on and on with the members of the corporeal staff and thus preserve their accumulating life experiences as attendants to the latter. At the outbreak of the rebellion, each had accumulated 300,000 years of close experience with the personalities of Dalamatia

It is not given to us in our present life circumstances to see or listen to the speech of a brilliant Lanonandek Son, We thus have no concept of their high intelligence or intellectual fluidity, their sophisticated logic or rationale or argumentative assests. That all of these must be outstanding is only too well illustrated by the fact that Caligastia and Daligastia were able to use their talents so well in the perversion of their universe responsibilities to ensnare 60 members of their corporeal staff and 44 modified Andonites in their web of deceit and treason to all.

By contrast, the work of Van and Amadon in keeping 88 totally mortal Andonites from rebellion stands out, considering the tremendous odds which they faced, including those incorporated by the presence of Lucifer as head of the opposition.

The purpose of this writing, however, is to give highly honorable recognition to the 88 simple, primitive, mostly unlettered, certainly quite ignorant by our standards. men and women of the Andonite band who remained faithful. They remained so in the face of defection of 44 of their own highly favored tribesmen and tribeswomen and 60 of the superhuman corporeal staff and despite the impressive, brilliant intelligence and authoritative stances of Caligastia and Daligastia, with all their sophistries and rationalizations. Truly quiet human heroes. We will someday look for the portrayal of their courage and fidelity on the panoramic history exhibitions on Jerusalem.
