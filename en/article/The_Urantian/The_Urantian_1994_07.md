## The Journal

_The Journal_ is a literary and artistic as well as a philosophical and investigative publication for readers of _The Urantia Book_. It publishes works of excellence related to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and chosen from submissions of readers throughout the world. Both content and quality are considered by editors in choosing what to publish in _The Journal_.

The publication includes poems, artwork, photography, essays, and other forms of prose, including fiction. Non-fiction may include philosophical essays, scientific articles, and speculative pieces based on issues in _The Urantia Book_.

The artwork or photography chosen for the cover of each issue must be of exceptionally high quality due to its prominence. Cover art is currently sought for the next issue.

## Submitting Material

Everyone is invited to submit work to be considered for publication. But we ask that you send only a few of your best poems or a related series of poems rather than a book of many poems. Shorter essays have the best chance to get in. And it is better to send a high-quality photograph of your artwork or a camera-ready copy of your photoart that does not need to be returned. Of course, if original artwork must be sent directly to us, we will return it, though it is still preferable at least to send a photograph first to help the decision as to whether it will be published.

## Cover Artwork:

This unique work was created by the Silent Artists. Through art, this group of artists is dedicated to achieving a greater understanding of who and what we are relative to the universe. It represents the entire universe as described in _The Urantia Book_ published by the Urantia Foundation located in Chicago, IL. This unique perspective on religion, philosophy and science has inspired the Silent Artists to undertake this one-of-a-king endeavor. The painting came to fruition through the skills and effort of some 25 individual artists. This project is dedicated to the readers of _The Urantia Book_.
