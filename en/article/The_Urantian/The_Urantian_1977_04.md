## Patterns Of Predictability

When a new idea first appears it may seem simple and formless, mainly because we have not yet begun to realize its many facets. Greater exposure sometimes reveals a complex and seemingly unrelated profusion of elements inherent in this originally simple concept. What was at first a hazy and amorphous totality takes on the appearance of chaos and confusion. Finally, the observation of certain patterns and the growth of understanding bring into focus the unifying factors which knit these diverse elements into a single fabric.

One of the functions of research is to look for patterns, or regularities, in an unknown universe. The validity of a pattern, once observed, may be tested by its “predictability,” the capacity to describe unobserved phenomena from those which are perceived. Many of us find, however, that the patterns which are within the grasp of our limited senses do not allow us to project a clear image of the spiritual realm. Thus, without revelation, this dimension would lie mainly uncharted.

## Pattern Personalities

The Eternal Son is the pattern personality, but only the Universal Father-the ancestor and source of this absolute pattern-can bestow personality. “Pattern” indicates an original (a model, guide, or archetype), and since the Eternal Son is the pattern personality, what an excellent model for all personalities in God's universe.

Pattern personalities seem to be the first of their order-like the original pattern angel (supernaphim) of Paradise and the original (first-born) pattern angel (seraphim) of the local universe, In Havona there are many classes of pattern beings-actually a pattern being for all personalities in all universes. The outer circuits contain patterns for time and space mortals' goal attainment.

## Family Patterns

Genetic families and study group families are both the workshops of Our Father. They provide adjustment of the self to other selves. They allow for cultivation of our Father's love through which Thought Adjusters, the Spirit of Truth, and our other spiritual benefactors may help us achieve the uplifting of humanity.

The home provides the first opportunity for fostering fraternal devotion among members. Study group 5 whose members loyally seek to live loving service also find themselves experiencing similar loving relationships. In talking with his apostles concerning love and the family, Jesus said: “_The people of another age will better understand the gospel of the kingdom when it is presented in terms expressive of the family relationship-when man understands religion as the teaching of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, sonship with God._” (<a id="a58_554"></a>[UB 142:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_4)) We are the people of another age.

Mature study groups, like “true” families, promote brotherly love and the fulfillment of the “golden rule” by actively fostering the brotherhood of man revelation on earth. This is a valuable achievement. But Jesus admonishes his followers to love men as he loves us-to love with a fatherly as well as a brotherly affection. If we are to represent Jesus to our family of man, he expects us to display the supreme reactions of fatherly affection-assured faith and perfect love.

## Patterns Of Revelation

Unlike the many valiant souls who have promoted spiritual truth in past epochs, we, the mortal disseminators of the URANTIA revelation, have many advantages, some bestowed, such as the Spirit of Truth, and some acquired, such as mass communications, and the power to view history from hindsight. Because of our advantages, our responsibilities are, in a sense, greater, and it is for this reason that the writer feels the revelatory commission has purposely given us much historical background upon which to base our future decisions.

One of the most significant statements for evaluating what has been done and what ought and ought not to be done in advancing spiritual truth is: “_Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man's capacity for receptivity._” (<a id="a70_236"></a>[UB 92:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_1))

Several thoughts may flash to our minds. Are we only to give what the traffic can bear? Compromise? Sell out? This is far from the intent of the Melchizedek author. Rather is he giving us a lesson derived from the long evolutionary struggle of uplifting the spiritual life of Urantian civilization. To illustrate, let us look at the experience of those who initiated or were teachers of an earlier epochal revelation.

## The New Cult — Pattern and Symbol

> “_...a cult — a symbolism of rituals, slogans, or goals —_ ” (<a id="a80_64"></a>[UB 87:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_10))

What is a pattern? On the lowest level of our perception, we see it as a space-time phenomenon, the weaving of relationships into a meaning. Aesthetically, this is the relationship of colors, of textures, of sounds. Psychologically, it is the relationship of motives, of desires, of actions. Spiritually, it is “unspeakable” except through symbols.

Paradise is the existence center of pattern. Paradise itself is non-personal and patterns may be organizations of non-personal matter.

Taking an object arbitrarily from our sensory experience, a stone, we sce that a stone in and of itself could be non-living and non-organic. But if we use the stone as a symbol, it becomes the “Rock of Ages” and unfolds in layers and layers of meaning until we perceive the strength of God-a personal quality. So have the impersonal and personal been reunited through the symbol.

## Pattern And Perfection

Because it would be impossible to deal adequately with such a complex and difficult subject as pattern in a short article, I asked myself what the principal meaning and practical value of pattern is for me. In the first place it is linked up with perfection, The presence of pattern is the validation and justification of the divine mandate: “Be you perfect, even as I am perfect.” How could our loving Father demand his children to be perfect if that perfection were not already present as a potential?

The perfection that is being demanded of us here and now is not absolute perfection. There exists variety in perfection (see _The URANTIA Book_, <a id="a96_145"></a>[UB 0:1.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_19)). Pattern also has its variety in phases. Paradise is the absolute of pattern, Havona the perfection of pattern. The Supreme

Creators project pattern in time and space on ever descending levels, but, nevertheless, pattern remains pattern; it is always relatively perfect. The mercy of our Universal Father warrants that there is always a perfect balance between what is demanded of us and what is the potential for us, pattern. And at the same time there is the endless perspective: “ . . . as I am perfect.” A mandate of the God of love must be characterized by that love. What he demands of his sons he already has given them in potential. Said the father to the elder brother of the prodigal son: “ . . . all that I have is thine.” His mandate is really our greatest privilege.

## Patterns Great And Small

Several times in conversation with friends lately, the role of patterns has popped up. By “patterns” I mean the similar situations that persistently present themselves for analysis and decision in life. Since my acquaintance with _The URANTIA Book_ I have credited the seraphim attached to my case as having a hand in the reoccurring pattern of life situations. Are the patterns repeated because I have not learned some lesson presented before? Is the opportunity for choice repeated because I did learn something and should now demonstrate and deepen the meanings of this experience? Is there some chance of helping others learn in this persistent challenge? Perhaps any and all of these possibilities run through the meaning-values of patterns, but the beauty of the whole was not apparent until I turned again to _The URANTIA Book_ for some inspiration on the subject. Strangely, the paper I read was the one on the bestowals of Christ Michael (\# 119).

It was perhaps inevitable that in reading again about the lives of our Universe Father, I should broaden the scope of my thinking. By volunteering to live bestowal lives he, too, experienced the pattern lessons of evolutionary participation. As an individual of seven different orders he illuminated and embellished the day-by-day patterns of his service.
