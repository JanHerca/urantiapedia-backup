A Christian, no matter how modern in viewpoint, should be open to the fact that God's creation extends beyond his comprehension or experience, Because of this, and because angels have been part of scripture and teaching throughout the years, a Christian is open to the possibility that angels exist and that they serve a special function in creation.

For the most part, Christians under modern influence tend to view angels as Protestants do praying to the saints. That is, they “eliminate the middle man.” Most people experience God interceding directly into their lives rather than through some celestial being.

Many people who believe in the world of spiritualism and parapsychology believe that those who have died can continue to hover around people they love, and can be experienced and known by some gifted few. These “survivors” are rarely thought of as angels. Some of them are still very earthy and worldly and many are from pagan cultures. They aren't experienced as “angels” even by the gifted people to whom they appear.

The basic meaning of angel is a messenger of God. Most modern Christians experience God speaking to them in their own thoughts and feelings, in nature, and especially through other people. Many people who have no experience at all of celestial beings have met an angel of God when a good friend has courageously said, “I'm really worried about your drinking” or a young child says, “Sometimes I don't think you love me,”

A Christian's goal in life is to become what God means him to be. Any person or experience that helps us on our way can be an “angel” of God.
