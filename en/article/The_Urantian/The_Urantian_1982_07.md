## Thoughts On The Dissemination Of The Teachings Of _The Urantia Book_

> “_Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment._” (<a id="a35_171"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

These words herald a new age to come and underscore the anticipation that civilization is due for major changes of all-encompassing scope. We are also told that the “_... social, moral, economic, and political reorganization of the world_” (<a id="a37_241"></a>[UB 99:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_3)) can take place only under the leadership and inspiration of the spirit-born souls who will have been transformed by the coming spiritual renaissance.

Undoubtedly, the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_, the fifth epochal revelation on this planet, will play a critical role in augmenting the progressive evolutionary development which is taking place. By examining some of the problems currently facing evolutionary societal development, we may gain some insight into the role of the teachings in effectively bringing about civilization's transformation.

## The Quality Of Our Interface

In introducing _The URANTIA Book_ to other people, other cultures, and other faiths, the quality of our interface will be largely determined by how we see ourselves, and that in turn will determine how we will appear to others and therefore how they will respond to us. All else — our motives, our techniques, and our goals fall secondary to this one factor, because how we see ourselves in association with this new revelation determines those motives, techniques, and goals.

I anticipate that many of the various problems that we will encounter as we approach other peoples with the book will stem from our religion-like appearance. Although we lack many of the features that commonly characterize religions and churches there are a few primary similarities that need to be reckoned with and maybe in the process rectified.
