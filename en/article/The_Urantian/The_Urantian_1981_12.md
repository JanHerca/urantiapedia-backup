## Towards Human Understanding

### Editorial Viewpoint

There appears to be a growing involvement among readers of _The URANTIA Book_ in the process of education, as manifested by the recent appearances of such educational endeavors as the EDUCATION UPLIFT Newsletter and THE BOULDER SCHOOL, for Students of _The URANTIA Book_. When added to the ongoing summer workshops sponsored by the Education Committee of URANTIA Brotherhood, these efforts seem to signify the taking of concrete steps toward the socialization of concepts of education presented in _The URANTIA Book_.

The characteristics of what might hopefully be a more enlightened approach to education are varied, and will require continual exposure to trial and testing. Many of these characteristics have already been discussed and experimented with at the summer workshops and have found their way into the planning of dedicated groups in a variety of settings. It is truly exciting to see these concepts being actualized-to witness the growth of understanding as it is shared through the educational process.

## A Framework And Philosophy For Education

One of our missions as students of _The URANTIA Book_ is to integrate its spiritual truths with the secular realities we constantly encounter, thereby uplifting the ideologies and practicalities upon which our everyday lives are based.

We all do this in our own realms as our life styles, environments, talents, and interests indicate, and as our Father's will guides. For many of us a particular interest is education, both in our homes and in the schools. We have shared our ideas for years — along with our experiences, dreams, and problems — and we have come to be aware of the strong spiritual strains being woven through our daily contact with children. We've also begun to see how intimately the principles and purposes of education, as expressed in _The URANTIA Book_, have influenced us. Many are feeling a very strong commitment to consciously UPLIFT EDUCATION in our homes and communities so that the minds of children may seek values and meanings which will allow them to think more clearly and problem-solve with expanded awareness; so that their bodies may be trained and allowed to experience peak usefulness; so that their souls may be enriched through incorporating the harmonies of the universe with the patterns of daily living; so that we — as parents-to-be, parents, educators, and friends of children — do all we can to help them maximize their God-given abilities.

## Understanding Islam Today

The spiritual renaissance on our planet is like a series of four waves on a lake, emanating from a common center, expanding to realize the brotherhood of man. A freshened quest for truth, beauty, and goodness ripples through the experience of many a humanist. Strong currents of monotheistic devotion stir the souls of countless spiritual descendants of Melchizedek's gospel. Many Christians are seeking and finding the water of life, the true spirit of the Master's gift to us. And the movement of students of _The URANTIA Book_ carries the potential to integrate these concentric circles of realization. The purpose of this essay is to enhance our understanding and our brotherhood with Muslims.

**The Characteristics Of Islam**

If the steps in the growth of love are understanding. service, and wisdom, we may begin with the question, what is Islam?

The first associations that come to mind include holy wars, polygamy, the subjugation of women, taboos on pork and alcohol, fanatic revolutionary movements, and the politics of oil. We have heard of sufi mystics identifying with God and of extreme legalists, such as the pious scholar who refused to eat a watermelon because he could not determine from scripture how the Prophet would have eaten one. We know that the union of religious and political authority is a pattern based on the life of Muhammed and is common in Islam today.

> “_The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. Mutual understanding and fraternal love are transcendent civilizers and mighty factors in the world-wide realization of the brotherhood of man._” (<a id="a75_622"></a>[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7))
