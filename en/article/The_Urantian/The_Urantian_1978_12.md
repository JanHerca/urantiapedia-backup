## Circles Of Supremacy

When I approached the three papers in _The URANTIA Book_ on the Supreme, I was confused with the numerous ways the authors referred to the Supreme. There was the Supreme Being, God the Supreme, and the Almighty Supreme. There was also a reference to the Supreme Mind. I was aware the Supreme was God operating in time and space — a finite deity; but prior to these three papers I believed that the Supreme Being, God the Supreme, and the Almighty Supreme were interchangeable terms used in the same way _The URANTIA Book_ refers to Thought Adjusters as Mystery Monitors, Father fragments, indwelling spirits, etc. Why then were there three separate papers? Suddenly I realized that each term used in reference to the Supreme means something definite and slightly different from each of the other terms.

To help me understand the Supreme Being, I started to draw a correlation between the human mortal, who possesses distinct elements in its nature, and those elements which constitute the Supreme Being.

As human beings, we are composed of matter, mind, spirit, soul, and personality. The Supreme Being likewise has component members consisting of God the Supreme, the Almighty Supreme, and the Supreme Mind.

## The Supreme Being — A Definition

According to _The URANTIA Book_, the Supreme Being is an evolutionary Deity. He will have an eternal future but, unlike the Father, Son, and Spirit, he did have a beginning. At the present time he is not complete. He is evolving along with all of us and what we do has an influence on his evolution.

The best concise definition of the Supreme is as follows: “_The Supreme Being is the unification of three phases of Deity reality: God the Supreme, the spiritual unification of certain finite aspects of the Paradise Trinity; the Almighty Supreme, the power unification of the grand universe Creators; and the Supreme Mind, the individual contribution of the Third Source and Center and his co-ordinates to the reality of the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a50_443"></a>[UB 22:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p7_11))

_God the Supreme_ is present right now in Havona, but is not contactible. We will not see him or speak to him when we are in Havona. Master Spirit Number Seven, our own Master Spirit, speaks for him. The principal purpose of our sojourn on the sixth circle of Havona is to get a deeper appreciation of God the Supreme through Master Spirit Number Seven. God the Supreme is now expanding outward in God the Sevenfold.

## Personal Growth: The Seven Psychic Circles

_The article printed here is part of a paper presented at the Second Central Atlantic Conference of URANTIA Book readers, Rockville, Maryland, on October 28, 1978._

Our total-personality growth — our progressive attainment of the seven psychic circles — is and must be immensely influenced by the types of mind and spirit ministry which other speakers are discussing today. From the seventh to the third circle our mindal growth involves ever-intensified functioning of the adjutant mind-spirits, the spirits of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship, and wisdom. The Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth foster our spiritual growth as we ascend the seven psychic circles. Further, we are told that “_Circle by circle your intellectual decisions, moral choosings, and spiritual development add to the ability of the Adjuster to function in your mind; circle by circle you thereby ascend from the lower stages of Adjuster association and mind attunement, so that the Adjuster is increasingly enabled to register his picturizations of destiny with augmenting vividness and conviction upon the evolving consciousness of this God-seeking mind-soul._” (<a id="a63_1006"></a>[UB 110:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_5))

## In The Future...

We would like to devote an issue to the examination of the differences in origin, function, and destiny of the various personalities who authored the papers in _The URANTIA Book_. These differences often color the writings assigned to each personality, and we hope that such a study will enable us to know the individual writer and the respective class of individuals better. Let us know if you are interested in contributing.

> “_True it is, you mortals are of earthly, animal origin; your frame is indeed dust. But if you actually will, if you really desire, surely the heritage of the ages is yours, and you shall someday serve throughout the universes in your true characters — children of the Supreme God of experience and divine sons of the Paradise Father of all personalities._” <a id="a76_360"></a>[UB 112:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_19)
