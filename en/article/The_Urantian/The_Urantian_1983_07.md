## The Complex Personality Of Man

In _The URANTIA Book_ the term “personality” is used in a double sense. In the first place it is the personality as the Universal Father bestows it on a living organism with mind. This aspect we could call ‘the pure personality,’ or as the Germans would say, the personality _an sich_. But the combination of the pure personality with the organism often is also called personality. Sometimes the latter is called the identity. This identity is what the personality believes itself to be, with which personality identifies itself. This article deals mainly with the identity.

The first aspect of the personality-identity that we observe is the physical body, the living material energy system of man. A system is a conglomerate of at least three different parts, which function together as a unit. In the case of the physical body there are countless parts. In the last analysis each living cell is a part, and there are even smaller parts; a real microcosmos. A system is not an aggregate of the parts, but, seen from the level of the parts, it represents a new individual unit of a higher order. As it is an energy system, a discrete and limited system with its boundaries, it must have a form. It is not diffused energy. The material energy systemform is visible to us as the material body.

## About David Zebedee

When we read _The URANTIA Book_, we cannot help falling in love with some of the human beings who are described to us. Of course, there are a lot of them to appreciate, but the one I love is David Zebedee, brother of James and John. Salome, his mother, was related to Annas, the one-time high priest; and, she loved Jesus as one of her own sons. Jesus often went fishing with James, John, and David. The boys' father had been a close friend of Joseph, the human father of Jesus. Zebedee was a boat builder and Jesus worked for him a little more than a year. In fact, Jesus became an expert in both designing and building boats, and he created a new style of boat which was safer than the older models. The four Zebedee daughters almost worshipped Jesus, Of the Zebedee sons, James was interested in Jesus as a teacher and philosopher, John cared most for his religious teachings, and David respected him as a mechanic, but took little stock at the time in his religious views.
