_Editor's Note_

_Inspired by the joy, the love and the peace present on a hill at East Warburton, where we could almost touch the clouds, Elfie wrote this beautiful piece after our group meditation on one of those crisp mornings during the last conference._

I slip between morning sun and bird song
To the quiet of the sky.
“Whereto little traveller?”
“A visit home my Lord — oh please!”
“Your work is not complete.”
“Yes I know — a few moments only, this I need.”
“Go then, but quick.”
And quick I went, as fast as thought,
To a distant star
In Orion's mighty belt.
And words cannot describe the joy
Of a welcome by “US ALL”.
Straight to the heart of the fire,
Touched by each mind flame.
Here no need of words
Communion is a music
Too subtle for our ears to hear.
A semitone describes a day's events,
A chord the mystery of a dark abyss,
And a symphony tells a journey
To the planet Earth,
With all her strange complexities
Of taste and touch
And human love,
Oh God, dare I return!

**Elfie Knight**
