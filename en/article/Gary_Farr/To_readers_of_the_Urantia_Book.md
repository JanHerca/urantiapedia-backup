It seems to me that once again readers have focused on doing something immediately based on group consensus. Group study and social interaction have been replaced with “we need to do something now to spread the teachings.” In an effort to provide some help and to shed some light on our current situation, I would ask you to consider the following statements.

In reading the primary mission statement of Urantia Foundation, two facts stand out. The first is that the writer was not one of us, as evidenced by the language and the making of statements such as no one on this world could ever make. Second, the writer clearly said that it would be a religion that would make possible all the changes mentioned and that cosmology and philosophy would follow as a result.

The new religion is the religion of the spirit of the living God dwelling in the minds of men and women. It is distinct from all other religions in two ways. First, being sponsored by the divine spirit, it is to be revealed to us. Second, it contains within itself something that no other religion has. We seldom admit it, but what we secretly seek and never seem to find is that all-important critical element that we are missing. A religion that had this would sweep all other religions aside and spread rapidly throughout the world.

The driving force behind this new religion is proof. It provides the religionist with indisputable proof of the reality of God.

Our teachers tell us that the religionist “knows and knows now.” [[UB 102:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_4)]. The Master taught: “**You shall know** the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” [[UB 141:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p7_6) ; [UB 162:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p7_2); (Emphasis mine)] We are taught that justice is the basis of the divine plan, among others. If you faithfully believe that the Father is, and sincerely desire to do His will, He will reveal to you His present presence. This growing realization of His indwelling and your additional experiences provide proof to the human mind that it cannot be denied. The resulting changes and newly found peace will completely transform you. You will, in fact, be reborn.

You will be so changed that everyone you come in contact with will notice and search for what you have that they lack. Through this human contact, and through word, this new religion will spread inexorably throughout the planet. Word is the most effective method of disseminating new ideas and knowledge. Word is the second governing principle of the Urantia Foundation.

You must not think of this approaching event as something far in the future. The time is very near and the announcement could come at any moment.

The only strategy for the true believer to follow is to seek to find out the Father's will, and with all the faith and effort you can muster, actually do that will. No other strategy has any value, either to you or to this chosen group.

If, in the meantime, you wish to do something constructive, pray for the coming of the kingdom. And when you pray, believe, for the kingdom is indeed coming soon. Do not entertain the slightest doubt about this. May His peace be with you.

Your brother,
