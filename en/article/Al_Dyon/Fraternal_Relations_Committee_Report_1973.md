August 3,1973

During the past three years there has been no problem which required direct action by this committee.

We have been aware, however, of a developing interest on the part of individual members of some religious organizations which may forecast the likelihood that the time is approaching when the full functioning of this committee will be brought into play.

This would appear to mean that the committee would become increasingly involved in the interchange of ideas and programs which could be expected to result in the wide spreading of the truth portrayed by the Urantia Book and become accepted by the various churches and religions of this world.

What the future will hold for the Fraternal Relations Committee in facilitating the spreading of the truths of this book would be difficult to conjecture. But we at least appear to have passed the time when our watchword was simply to observe the trend of events and wait for further developments.

Albert H. Dyon, Chairman
