The Supreme Being is inextricably involved with the good of the whole. As we endeavor to become a better neighbor and a better citizen of our nation it becomes obvious that we are each a citizen of our world, Urantia; and from that insight we discern the necessity of becoming a contributing member of God's cosmic family-a citizen of the universe. In other words we must get into the action through the intelligent use of mind. This constitutes our experiential relationship to the Supreme as we embark on our journey of everlasting progress. All meaningful experience at the finite level is integrated in the Supreme,

The Chief of Seraphim on Urantia postulates that this synthesis of creature experience is largely manifested to the individual will creature through the ministry of the seraphim in their role as coordinators, correlators of mind and morontia, and interpreters. We can avail ourselves of this marvelous assistance by making our plans and then putting those plans into action. In some little understood technique this enables our guardian angels to assist in bringing those plans to fruition for the good of all those who love God. In this way, and even now on our initial sphere, we can initiate our activities as junior members of a team composed of angels and men. We can share the joy of this adventure in cooperation as we gradually wean ourselves from animal inertia and preoccupation with self.

Not only does the perfect guidance of the spirit within, the gentle leading of our Thought Adjuster, become clearer as we align our will with the will of God, but by our own efforts we are attaching ourselves to destiny. This is our contribution to the growth of the Supreme.
