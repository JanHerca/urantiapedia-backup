Guided, guarded, inspired, and assisted as we all are by the seraphim assigned to our watch-care, certain highly endowed and motivated mortals can also be involved in the plans and projects of the master seraphim whose activities are directed by the resident governor general on Urantia. The extent of this involvement probably depends primarily upon their origins and choices. Although the method of selection may be somewhat obscure, the lives of certain individuals stand out like beacons casting beams of influence and power across the planet. Such a person was Charles Lindbergh.

Lindbergh's influence upon aviation from 1927 when he made his historic flight across the Atlantic until his death in 1974 may have involved the angels of progress, nation life, the races, the future, industry, and diversion. And many could have been the conferences scheduled to handle the overlapping influences and consequences of his various endeavors. The watchword may even have been, “And what of Lindbergh?...” Imagine the far-reaching effects of his friendships and contacts as they brought the rulers of various countries together, the interchange of trade and finance, the inventions of industry, the mixing of peoples and cultures, the stimulation of travel and change, and the general education and training resulting from this activity in this field alone. This is not to mention his very considerable contribution in the fields of genetics, pollution, conservation, surveying, endangered species, medicine, wilderness exploration, and writing. He also served for long periods as an advisor to various industries and governments.

How was all this progressive activity guided and compressed into one short lifetime? One can only assume intensive effort and coordination on the part of his Thought Adjuster, guardian seraphim, and the master seraphim concerned, Lindbergh himself gives an answer in his _Autobiography of Values_, an excellent firsthand account of the sum and substance of his public life. For inner guidance, the implementation of plans, and the solution of his problems he turned to “...thought during driving, followed by a night's sleep, Obviously some rational process, of which my conscious mind was unaware, took place under such circumstance. Because the results were so consistent, I came to rely on the process.” Lindbergh described communication with his Thought Adjuster as “withdrawing to your core” and asserted that it brought him “closer to values of life and death.” It is significant that toward the end of his life he began to realize that his interests were shifting from the scientific to the mystical because he had learned that any science “pursued to its peripheries ended in mystery.”

## Company In The Cockpit

Describing his solo flight across the Atlantic in The Spirit of St. Louis he actually tells of two shining beings that hovered on either side of him in the tiny cockpit, giving advice and comfort. Even though subsequently he remembered no word they had said, he never forgot their beauty, and although consciously he was largely unaware of seraphic ministry, the evidence of his life and accomplishments is ample proof that such a ministry existed and demonstrates what can be achieved when man willingly attunes himself to the wavelengths of the angels.

Since Lindbergh died in 1974, it is not an invasion of his privacy to suggest he was in the reserve corps of destiny. He was certainly a pivotal individual because of his wide exposure to world leaders, national and industrial as well as the arts, and due to his expertise in many fields and high mobility, it was possible for him to be attached in a working capacity to ten or twelve worldwide projects at any given period of his adult life.

His ability to conquer time and achieve space was outstanding for a “lowly” mortal. In order to concentrate on the mindal and spiritual aspects of life he developed a technique for divesting himself of the drag of material possessions. He would package, catalog, and store them — he called this his “brown-package policy.”

Another technique he employed for getting in touch with higher guidance is described in some detail: “A quality of ‘time’ rides with travel which I have found under no other circumstances. It fertilizes subconscious (read superconscious) apprehension until visions emerge like — but more rational than — the visions brought forth by the quality of time that lies in sleep. Memory and imagination act on a stage of thought improvising practical and fantastic roles. I daydream of impossibilities and lay plans of action to approach them, and, still further, plans to implement plans.” He might even be describing the activities of the master seraphim who are “_... ideational clearinghouses, mind focalizers, and project promoters._” (<a id="a50_734"></a>[UB 114:6.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_19))

He retained his enthusiasm and dedication to making this world a better place for posterity to the very end of his life, stating. “The farther we penetrate the unknown, the vaster and more marvelous it becomes.” And this above all — he was a man of ACTION who left many footprints on the sands of his time.
