At the Parliament, people from over 350 different faiths and religions come together to celebrate what it is about each other's faith that fills our souls. The beauty of watching a Tibetan Buddhist monk create a sand painting, chanting with the Sikhs, enjoying a concert of Hindu music worshipping and honoring God, Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, including instruments and voices from all around the world.

To me, the Parliament is the best seeding of revelation that we ever do. The results will happen over the next 30 to 50 years in ways that none of us can imagine. Because the act is ours and the consequence is God's we cannot know the divine results until they happen over time. The growth is for us as well, in celebrating faith from many perspectives. Jesus was the best interfaith student that ever lived, studying the religions of his time. Shouldn't we also be?

The greatest moments at the Parliament for me are when all my pre-existing knowledge about a religion is shattered. By having a personal, direct interaction with a Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, or Native American believer, I wake up to a new realization of faith from another perspective, a real person, from a newly found friend.

My idealistic self expects that we will be experiencing more of the signs of living in the era of light and life, including the elimination of war, personal inner peace, a focus on philosophy, ethics and reason, with scientists and teachers leading the way, rather than business men and politicians.

Ideally, the three major world religions that were born of the teachings of Melchizedek would strengthen each other by discovering the extent of their commonality. This is a workshop that Sheila Keene-Lund is giving at the Parliament entitled “_How to Transition from Fragmentation to Integration._” I am  looking forward to this bold call to action from Sheila to Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Sheila is sharing her time with others speaking about a similar topic under the heading of “Living Religious Pluralism.”

There will be plenty of English and French Urantia books if you need one!

Thank you to Gary Tonge for the beautiful new Urantia booth design representing the four parts of _The Urantia Book_. The entire creative process was co-sponsored by the Urantia Foundation, Urantia Book Fellowship, Urantia Association International and Truthbook. 

Per our joint policy, all four organizations need to be listed on any material that is at the booth. We would like the booth to be aesthetically beautiful and uncluttered. Contact any of these fine organizations with questions you may have. 

For a life changing experience, I hope to see you at the Parliament!
