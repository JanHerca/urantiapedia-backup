The past two weeks I participated in Family Chapel with Angie Thurston and two of her colleagues.

This was a 30 minute prayer session every morning with an extra 20 minutes of social time afterwards on a zoom call.

I loved the simplicity of how the 30 minutes was divided up into three parts. First, we all lit a candle which symbolized our inner light. Then we listened to a song and a poem. When it was time to go into the zoom breakout room, we were given a task not to have a conversation, but to have a reflection about the song or poem.

In the final ten minutes we resumed as the full group of 40 participants. We were all muted so that one of the three leaders could say a prayer and repeat the opening song. We blew out our candles and tried to “catch the smoke” and pour it over our heads, without spilling any wax.

During the social time we were asked a broad question like "what do you feel is supporting you during this time of isolation?”

The three weeks are over now, and we were all tasked to create our own online zoom prayer groups. I would like to recommend their website Sacred Design Lab https://sacred.design/ as an incredible resource. It seems we are all hungry for spiritual resources these days!
