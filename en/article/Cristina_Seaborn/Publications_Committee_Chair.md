A couple of months before the Publications Chair election, I had a dream that I should run as Publications Chair for the Urantia Book Fellowship. This startled me awake. What do I know about publications? I'm a musician! I always know it's divine guidance to service when my reaction is that strong.

Starting as Publications Chair in July 2018, I have enjoyed learning many new aspects of publications, including working with the fabulous editors on my committee and the amazing talented authors in our movement. Our past Publications Chair of 22 years, Linda Buselli, mentored me, as did Paula Thompson, our Executive Director. Linda has recently graduated. We honor her 22 year contribution to Publications with much gratitude.

Our Publications Committee Members are: Cristina Seaborn (Chair), Jill Strunk, Eric Rice, Avi Dogim, Stephen Sawyer, Barbara Newsom, Cece Forrester, and adjunct Jack Holloway.

Several people have given me ideas for Publications, which I welcome. Please let me know any way we can improve our communications on this survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FNPK28S

Here are Publications we have featured last year:
1. Fall Mighty Messenger 2018: focus on the Parliament of the World's Religions 
2. Spring Mighty Messenger 2019: diverse articles from our creative community with many talented authors!
3. The fall Mighty Messenger 2019: featuring what the Fellowship does through our committee volunteer work.
4. Fellowship Herald 2019 theme: our Local Universe Mother Spirit
5. Monthly electronic newsletter: Mini Messenger

**Publications Overall Budget**

We mail our paper publications free to 1800 people. Cost to print and mail the Mighty Messenger is $1500 twice a year. Printing and postage costs are once a year at $5000 Postage for the three paper publications to 1800 people is $5000. Labor (not counting the committee's time, which is volunteer) is $2000 for all three paper publications (2 Mighty Messengers, 1 Fellowship Herald)

**Upcoming Publication Deadlines**

Spring Mighty Messenger deadline is March 15^th^ 2020

Summer Fellowship Herald deadline is April 15^th^ 2020

Theme: God the Supreme and How We Serve the Supreme

The Mini Messenger articles are due by the 10^th^ of each month.

Here is our Publications solicitation and survey with 68 responses to date asking: Would you prefer to receive our magazines, the Mighty Messenger and Fellowship Herald, in electronic form or in print or both? This survey will take one minute. Please let us know here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T5LFL86

Thank you, Cristina Seaborn, Publications Chair

**IDEAS FOR PUBLICATIONS**

**From Emilio Coppola:**

1. Create a publication that is dedicated to new Urantia Book readers.
2. Create another that is focused on leaders for study groups and providing them community and resources.
3. Create a publication for societies.

**From Patrick Yesh:**

1. A Publication focused on the arts
2. In each publication ask for Urantia and sacred artists to submit their work, or articles describing their work, to the editor to be chosen for future publications.
3. Run a contest for artists to come up with portrayals of the fruits of the spirit, seven adjutant mind spirits, divine fruits, etc. and pick a winner or just feature them in your publications.
4. Create a publication just for the Urantia Sacred Arts - all the arts. forget the quotes, tired of them, let's see what is in our spiritual imaginations.
5. If you are writing on a theme like the Garden of Eden, ask for artists to participate with their depictions of it and of Adam and Eve on the fandor birds etc.
6. Feature one of Mo Siegel's commissioned pieces in each publication with the story from the artist.
7. Love to run an article with an invitation to the world readership about holding an all Fine Arts Sacred Arts conference. No intellectual readings or discussions allowed, just pure art creations in all the arts, music dance movement, theatre, poetry, literature, novels, scripts, sculptures, paintings, drawings, movies, YouTubers (Teuvo Orjala's work), digital arts, etc.
8. Do a newsletter or arts publication quarterly with references and links to their work websites. Attract the same sacred arts inside and outside the Urantia Book movement. Publish websites where art, music, and writings can be purchased and help support the artists.

**From Cristina Seaborn:**

1. Create a Urantia Graduation and Remembrances web page on our new website to commemorate those who have made their transition, including a Urantia funeral service, resources for caregivers, prayer, songs, information on the afterlife, photos, and other needs. 
2. A Society Corner
3. A Team Chair Corner
4. A President's Corner

**From Barbara Newsom**

1. Produce an annual report of what the Urantia Book Fellowship does.
