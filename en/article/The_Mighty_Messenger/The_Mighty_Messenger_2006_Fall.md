And that is but half what is going on!

With absolute certainty, I can sav that the Fellowship's future is full of uncertainty, change, hope, and vision. With so much exciting work being done now and organtzed for the future, we need all the support and help that can be mustered from the readership."

## President's Report

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2006_Fall/Avi_Dogim.jpg">
</figure>

_The following is a summary of the report given to the General Council by out-going President, Avi Dogim on July 9, 2006._

The Urangia Book Fellowship continued its outreach and dissemination activities over the past year through the media of print and the Internet, through social garherings, interfaith activities, expos, book donations, and marketing. The enthusiasm and energy among the pcople who coordinate and participate in these various activities is high and can be matched only by their dedication to the mission of making the fifth epochal revelation available to all our fellow residents on this planet.

The Fellowship recognizes the impottant work done for the advancement of the revelation by individuals and groups who are not formally affiliated with it. It stands ready to collaborate with any group on any project that is consistent with the stated purpose of the Fellowship to disseminate _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings to the peoples of the world. Efforts have been made over the past few years to identify specific areas of common interest between The Fellowship and Urantia Foundation and to explore possible joint projects between the two organizations. As part of these efforts, I met privately with Seppo Kanerva, the Foundation President, on the campus of Villanova University during IC '05. We drew up a list of possible areas of cooperation, but haven't as yet begun a joint operation. Members of both the Fellowship and the UAI as well as many individuals unaffiliated with either organization were involved in the planning and execution of IC '05. An invitation by the Fellowship to the UAI to plan a joint IC '05 was rebuffed by the UAI. However, the Fellowsltip will continue to keep its door open to such in the future.

With impetus given by Joe Liska, a long time reader, several members of the Fellowship and the UAI helped organize a “non-organization” 50th Anniversary celebration of the publication of The Urantia in Chicago in October of 2005. In attendance were Foundation Trustees, most of the Fellowship's Executive Comrnittee, and other Fellowship and UAI members as well as a number of Chicago readers, some of whom remembered well the day the books first rolled off the press. The good will of all who were there was palpable and ought to savored.

Over the past three years, the Fellowshtp has continued the process of virtualizing its admtnistrative operation, i.e., increasing the utilization of intemet based communications and data transfer operations and reducing our dependency on brick and mortar. To deal with the myriad issues involved, we formed an administrative team, and also an ad hoc information technology (IT) committee.

Less than a year ago, we formed a website content group largely in responee to recommendations made by the General Council that the The Fellowship's website should overseen a group rather than by any single indiviual. Initial recommendations from this group have already been made.

This council holds the intellectual, moral, and indeed, spiritual potential to move us forward.

## Paula Thompson — New Executive Director

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2006_Fall/Paula_Thompson_and_Bobbie_Dreier.jpg">
</figure>

I joined the Rocky Mountain Urantia Society in 1982. At that time I had been reading _The Urantia Book_ for 6 years. I joined at the behest of my good friends Jo Ann Wiedman and Linda McNelly. They both impressed on me the need to pool individual together to achieve a modicum of efficacy in disseminating the revelation. They aptly pointed out that with the internacional Urantia community being so small and so spread out, it was of vital importance that dedicated believers join together to serve. Back then, we all felt blessed to have and belong to our local Urantia socicty. We had a deep sense of purpose and mission. For many, that feeling was lost in the subsequent ideological troubles our movement experienced, but not for me. Perhaps it's because since 1989 I have had the unique oprortunity to travel around the country serving shoulder to shoulder with various Urantia groups on Outreach Committee projects. In View of the dedication I witnessed coming from the various reader communities visited, my sense of mission not only did not diminish, it became even more vital.

Those who know me know how much I love our Fellowship. I feel blessed to be associated with the splendid human beings I have come to know and love in this organization. I willingly serve _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship because of my association with the amazing reople I have met who also serve it. These dedicated people, people like John Hales, have made an indelible impression on me. This little organization has persevered through some serious challenges, and yet, after fifty years it's still here serving with stalwart dedication. It not only devotedly serves God and Man, but it also sacredly serves the Brotherhcod of Believers.

Our Fellowship of revelacion believers is on the move. With fifty continuous years of service to our credit, and hearts courageous, we are poised and ready to meet the challenges of the next fifty years and beyond. The world cries out in desperation for the profound truths we enjoy every day in _The Urantia Book_. I know of a certainty that our Fellowship is not only willing to answer this call but capable of answering it in ways heretofore unimagined. With some of the huge challenges of the past behind us we are moving forward with a renewed sense of purpose and mission. I'm profoundly honored to have been asked to act as the Fellowship's Director in this new era, I promise to do my utmost to serve not only Fellowship members, but each and every person who loves and serves the revelation.

Saying goodbye to someone like John Hales, who has served as our Director for the last 32 years, could never be easy. It would be impossible for me to fill his shoes, but I promise to all those who love the Fellowship as I do, that I will give this post my utmost effort and will mobilize every personal attribute I possess to live up to the trust you have placed in my hands.

> When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father's will, when man gives God all that he has, then does God make that man more than he is. [[UB 117:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p4_14)]

## Preparing for IC '08

All over this planet, people are working to make our Father's love a reality by partnering with others to do good works and make positive and lasting changes in loving, spirit led service. We would like to hear of your service adventures ot those of others you know.

Many of our Urantia family members are also out in the trenches doing the work of our Paradise Father and Spirit Mother. Some of this work is a large effort, some on a smaller scale. Examples are:
- Our Personal Ministry to Fellows - living a life of spirit led service in our daily lives.
- The Pipeline of Light - distributes Urantia Books all over the world
- Free Schools - Providcs a free education to impoverished young girls in India
- Interfaith - Working with many other religions to foster understanding
- The Sewing Project - Raised funds to buy sewing machines for poor women in Kenya.
- Study Groups - Supportinq the individuals in their study of _The Urantia Book_ and supporting those who go out into the community in the service of these ideals.
- Cosmic Café - Local community based discusion groups focused on spiritual growth.
- InnerLife International - A service organization dedicated to training leaders through service.
- Youth Camps - Where our young learn about spitituality and themselves.
- Expos - Book booths at public events to share _The Urantia Book_ and interact with other seekers.
- Churches - Many readers attend churches and other religious services and find this a valuahle service outreach opportunity.
- Conferences Providing a place and time for people to socialize and learn.
- Any service where we are spirit led to serve.

As you can see, the theme of the 2008 conferences is “The Thrill Of Loving Service.” Our goal is to expand our understanding of what it means to be of service and how we are spirit led to find these opportunities. We need your help. Would you consider sharing with us the service work you are doing? Sharing your work will help us organtze the conference workshops and speakers and give us greater insight into the path of spiritual service.

We have a definite vision for this conference and sharing your work will help us incorporate yout experience and wisdom into the conference. We appreciate it so much. Please respond as soon as you can, letting us know what you are doing or what you desire to do. Planning is currently under way.

## Pipeline of Light by the Numbers

Pipeline of Light Report

By Michelle Klimesh

The Pipeline of Light kicked into high gear during the first Six months of 2006. Between January and June, we placed 352 copies of _The Urantia Book_ (including translations, the audio version, and English) into twenty-two countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, South Africa, Lithuania, Pakistan, Republic of Guinea, Zambia, Croacia, Argentina, Chile, Myanmar, Greece, Panama, Nicaragua, India, Brazil, Egypt, France, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Algeria and the Philippines. We have since placed books readers in Iceland, Germany, Chechnya, and Peru for a total of twenty-six countries so far this year.

How do we do it? Every way we can think of. Sometimes books are sent with travelers who are vacationing in other countries. One Pipeline volunteer travels extensively for business, and he makes excellent use of the Fellowship's contacts to find readers who need books. The International Committee sent ambassadors this year to a Urantia conference in Ecuador, and also to Africa to follow up on contacts originally made by Norman Ingram years ago.

We've experimented in the past several months with new ideas. We send post cards redeemable for one book with Pipeline volunteers as they travel, so they don't have to pack so many cases of real books. We had one creative reader in the USA who purchased a book himself and sent it directly to a seminary student in Zambia. As time goes on, I'm sure we will find many ways to keep the flow of the revelation moving outward into the world.

Your support of the Pipeline of Light keeps the revelation flowing to these proverbial corners of the earth. Please help us! Donations are accepted online at http://urantiabook.org./support.htm or by mail to: _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, P.O. Box 4583, Grand Central Station, New York, N Y. 10163.

## Memories of SSS '06

A Personal View

By Deb Manske Biechler

For twenty-plus years, I have been reading _The Urantia Book_, on my own and with a study group. As I anticipated my first conference, the Summer Study Session at the Dominican University outside of Chicago, I was hoping for more of the doubling and tripling of insight that my study group affords me. What happened was even better. Coming to the conference popped things open another dimension, adding the depth of experiential wisdom.

The experiences began with a retreat led Bobbie Dreier and Gard Jameson. Then there were the angel workshops. Jules O'Connor and Charles Olivea's session inspired stories of personal encounters with these guardians. Tony Finstad's All About Angels workshop and beautifully organized handout will help me to introduce _The Urantia Book_ to people who have not yet discovered the revelation. Stevie (Stephanie) Shaefer, in her Angels as Messengers workshop challenged her participants to gain deeper knowledge from these beings who serve as bridges of understanding by using a dictionary regularly. Especially helpful are those published circa late 1920s to 1934.

These are just a few of the experiencial tools I've taken home with me to use in my reading, my work, and my spiritual journey. They alone are worth attending the conterence.

The experience is priceless when you add to that the friendships created in this spiritual fellowship. These newly formed relationships connect me in a beautiful web of intelligent love that stretches across the country. If you have never attended a conference before, I invite you to experience the stereoscopic effect that only a gatheting like this can afford.

A gala party honoring John Hales' many years of service to Fellowship was held on Saturday evening, July 8, as part of the festivities at the Summer Study Sesion '06. Present were all of the living ex-presidents of The Fellowship as well as John's family and a large group of friends and well-wishers. John was presented with a beautiful solid crystal book, fashioned after _The Urantia Book_ with the title on top and three concentric circles beneath it with an inscription, as a token of appreciation for his service to the revelacion.

All seven living ex-presidents of the Fellowship gathered to honor John Hales on his retirement as Administrative Director of the Fellowsllip. Left to right are Paul Snider, Meredith Sprunger, John Hales, Dave Elders, Steve Dreier, Janet Farrington-Graham, and Avi Dogim.

## Into Africa

By Buck and Arlene Weimer

Africa! The very name dormant emotions, excites adventurousness, and prompts a creative vision. At the behest of the International Committee of the Fellowship, we traveled to Africa from February 23 to March 12, 2006, spending most of our time in Zambia and a few days in South Africa.

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2006_Fall/005643.jpg">
</figure>

Our goals were to foster relationships with as many Urantia Book readers as possible, while delivering books, placing books in libraries, instigating study group activity, identifying leaders, and answering questions. We carried wich us three cases of books, a stack of various brochures, three dozen t-shirts, many copies each of two different posters, a bag of spiritual vitamins, and Fellowship business cards, as well as many personal gifts.

We first traveled to Ndola, Zambia to hook up with Chita and Namukale, whom we initially met in Barcelona during the Conference for the Parliament of the Worlds Religions and then again last summer at Villanova during IC '05. Chita and Namukale did much to prepare for the historic “Sunday conference” on February 23 at the Savoy Hotel. Included in the program were: several power-point presentations, reading from _The Urantia Book_, a luncheon, a Jesus remembrance supper and many—very many— questions and answers. Fourteen of us participated.

The next day, our presentation at the Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation School of Theology was attended by more than thirty-four (standing room only) students, teachers, and ministers from many seminaries and schools of theology in the Central African region. We were totally amazed at the number of students coming up at the end to ask for copies of the book. And, as recently as two weeks before this writing, students continue to contact us for books.

On our flight to Cape Town, South Africa, we stopped for a short layover in Johannesburg where we had prearranged to meet with Simone Cox. What a fireball! She is full of energy and on fire with _The Urantia Book_, a great pesrson, and an emerging leader in the region.

<figure id="Figure_15" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2006_Fall/005644.jpg">
</figure>

Once in Cape Town, the Rev John Oliver, an Anglican priest, met us and quickly integrated us into the evening's Bible study group. He openly reads from _The Urantia Book_ during services and calls himself “a bridge” between the revelation and Christianity. We also attended an evening conference at the rectory.

The Africa we saw is a Utantia Book stronghold “waiting to happen.”" Everywhere we went people talked easily about God as if it were an integral part of their lives, no inhibitions, no political correctness, without reservations. The revelation is alive and thriving in Zambia and South Africa.

May I had the privilege of being part of a team of members of the Fellowship on a traveling 10-day conference in Equador. The Team was composed of Buck and Arlene Weimer, Lynn Chapman, Susan Ransbottom, all from Colorado and myself from California. We were joined by Dr. Francisco Arias, Dr. Frannia Arias and Nidia Arias from Costa Rica, Mario Ferreyra from Argentina, Jose Manuel Rodriguez from Colombia and the trip organizer, Nelida Oliver from Ecuador.

We visited four cities, Quito, Ibarra, Ambato and Quayaquil and we gave presentations on _The Urantia Book_ in hotel conference rooms and community centers. Members of our group also participated in newspaper and radio interviews. Highlights of this trip were the wonderful teamwork and high energy of the group and the very and gracious way that we were welcomed.

Some lasting memories were being 15,000 feet up in the mountains near Quito, the wonderful dinner and musical entertainment hosted by the study group in Ambato, and the bus trip down mountain roads back to Quayaquil. I recall Susan trying to hang on to her laptop as she, Jose Manuel, and I translated some materials for our next presentation. We gave away four cases _Urantia Books_, book marks, posters, t-shirts, and coupons for more books. Meeting so many new readers was a real honor and we could not help but be inspired by their hunger for the Revelation.
