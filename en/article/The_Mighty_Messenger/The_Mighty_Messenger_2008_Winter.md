## Oh My God-Consciousness!

**2009 Study Session**

“I hope you don’t mind my saying, but your God-consciousness is showing.” Have you noticed _The Urantia Book_ places definitions of God-consciousness conspicuously in the last sentence of the Foreword and the first sentence of the last paragraph in the whole book?

> “…the ever-progressing reality of personal religious experience—God-consciousness.” <a id="a42_86"></a>[F:XII.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_13)

> “And God-consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the self with the universe…” <a id="a44_90"></a>[[UB 196:3.35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_35)]

The entire teachings are held in the arms of God-consciousness. At every level of our progress, it is this continuous effort to push the envelope of self, soul and spirit consciousness that constitutes God-consciousness. It is the experience and fact of becoming more real.

Do you feel more real today than you did yesterday? Get real. Come to the new 2009 Study Session, “God Consciousness—A Living University,” Friday, July 31, to Sunday, August 2, at Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois. Pre-conference activities will be Wednesday evening, July 29 through Thursday, July 30. This session we will explore avenues to reach heightened states of God-consciousness no matter what ‘level’ we are or think we are, including:
- Revelatory-inspired learning methods, action study, and give you the chance to immediately apply what you have learned.
- Expanded pre-conference day: choice of (1) spiritual retreat, (2) workshop on preparing teachers and leaders, or (3) Art in Chicago—tours of the “city of this visitation.”
- Launch of an on-going program of in-depth study of the teachings that begins with an exciting new program of pre-study for the 2009 meeting.

Registration and program details will be available soon on the Fellowship website. To propose a presentation or workshop, contact Barbara Newsom, Conference Program Chair, 2009 Study Session, barbnewsom@aol.com or other members of the Education Committee: Gary Deinstadt, Chair, gdeinstadt@gmail.com; Katharina Becker, Lila Dogim, Charles Olivea, Cayce Snider, Nick Stefero, and Phil Taylor.

## President’s Report 2008

Wow, the Fellowship has more significant longterm projects under development than ever before, and like any growing organization we have many challenges. We strive to sustain growth opportunities while balancing our resources, maintaining our assets, and continuing to develop sound future infrastructure. Amazing projects are presented every week, great news for the revelation, but they require us to build and finance an infrastructure that keeps pace with these emerging opportunities. 

The best news is that dissemination is happening! The book is finding its way into the hands of truth seekers around the world, due in no small part to our efforts. Here is a partial overview of the many areas in which Fellowship work is proceeding and succeeding. 

Uversa Press: In September we took delivery of 10,000 copies of the next printing of _The Urantia Book_. Two thousand of these books are being delivered without dust jackets and will be earmarked for international distribution. These books include copies of the free audio DVD. 

This past year, three high quality audio books containing various papers from Part IV were published. An electronic version of the book was published for Amazon’s Kindle reader and is adaptable to other electronic book readers as well. More than 25% of our book orders now come from the Internet, allowing us to capture the purchaser’s name, address, and other contact information. Book sales in all formats are now averaging 300 per month and this number nearly triples when we include downloads of text and audio versions of the book from our website. This does not take into account the UB translations sold through our web store. 

IC08: By all measures IC08 will be remembered as a wonderful success. Initial projections planned for 700 attendees, but significant changes in the economy resulted in 200 less attendees. Even so, the teamwork and planning needed to adjust to this situation was inspiring and resulted in real social success. 

The Auto-Debit Program: Our growing auto-debit program provides increasing financial stability with approximately 120 monthly contributors providing $7,000 per month toward our operating expenses— $84,000 annually. In addition, the Pipeline of Light contributions average well over $600 per month leading to the placement of books in more than 60 countries around the world. To make online donations, go to http://urantiabook.org/support.htm 

Publications: The immensely popular “Herald” continues to be published with the next edition containing 40 pages of articles written by readers. The Mighty Messenger newsletter also reaches our entire mailing list, and the Community Update e-newsletter now goes out to more than 2,000 subscribers. 

Outreach: In addition to Fairs and Expos, the Outreach Committee is developing the Cosmic Cafe program and video-based educational resources. The new Ambassador Program is providing speaking skills training. _The Urantia Book_ Club on university campuses is growing with efforts managed by Don Green who has exhibited the UB at the University of Colorado for 25 years. 

In support of a reader-initiated project, we recently sent 900 books to military units deployed around the world.

Finance: At the end of  July, our balance sheet showed a 1% loss from the beginning of the year. Considering a couple of budget overruns, a troubled investment environment, a financially difficult (though socially very successful IC08), and the general state of the US economy, we are doing considerably well. Book sales were up by 5.5%, overall expenses were down by 8.8%, and overall net income on retail was up by 38%. We maintain adequate reserves while doing everything we can to fund the ever increasing dissemination projects. 

With the responsibility to participate in the worldwide dissemination of an epochal revelation, and to provide a social and fraternal association “among the peoples of the world,” we have a tall order to fulfill considering our total assets are less than the smallest community churches in America. Our financial “muscle” will strengthen with a firm commitment of the readership to do so. Our current reliance on donations, investments, and social enterprise (retail of products and services) can be improved, as we also work to establish endowments, create sponsorship opportunities and apply for grants. All revenue sources are needed for long term success. 

International Fellowship: This year we participated in the Delhi Book Fair in India, one of the largest book fairs in the world, where thousands of “spiritual vitamins” and introductory brochures, 10 cases of books and a case of the Urdu sampler were distributed. Important contacts were made with regional readers who are interested in fostering groups in their areas and who are willing to assist with translations of secondary works. Groundwork is also being done in India and Pakistan. The group in Islamabad has just completed an Urdu translation of the first five papers in Michelle Klimesh’s book The Story of Everything to be published as a booklet. 

We participated in the Buenos Aires book fair in Argentina, a joint project shared with Urantia Foundation and UAI. Significant work is also being done in Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, and Nicaragua with the undaunted efforts of Agustin Arellano, the Fellowship’s Spanish Reader Services representative.

Interfaith: The Interfaith Committee maintains contact with dedicated readers who are working within the interfaith movement. Current work includes putting together a syllabus for an annual World’s Religions Study Retreat. This program will eventually include components of training for participation in interfaith dialog. We would like to make our fourth appearance at the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Melbourne, Australia, in 2009. The Parliament in 2004 had over 50 Urantian attendees. 

Relations with Urantia Foundation: Through the work of our Liaison Chair, Marvin Gawryn, long-term planning is in place to reduce duplication of effort, enhance communications, and facilitate an integrated approach to the dissemination efforts shared by all Urantia organizations. The Fellowship has been enabled to publish Foundation translations on its website and sell translations through our web store. 

Membership: The membership committee is personally contacting every non Fellowship member in our database. This amounts to contacting some 5,000 readers in an effort to stimulate greater involvement.  The purpose is to build a stronger corps of volunteers to pursue more outreach opportunities. 

Website/IT: The English language website continues to experience a 25% to 30% annual growth rate of users including visits from truth seekers from more than 80 countries. The website is going through a complete redesign and a number of new services have been initiated, including the online study of _The Urantia Book_ with links to audio versions of every section, to the topical index, the Paramony, and a summary of each paper based on Michelle Klimesh’s The Story of Everything. The Polygloss, created by Troy Bishop, allows for the simultaneous display of any two translations, an invaluable tool for translators. 

Secondary works are being formatted and made available for download. The study group directory provides the ability to do proximity searches—put in your zip code, specify a distance range, and you can find any study groups within that range. 

The IT committee continues to work on the development of the database, putting readership information into a unified system for improved global dissemination efforts. The Urantia “movement” is the first major religious movement to emerge in the cyberspace era. Instead of investing in real estate, temples, or offices, we have chosen to be a “virtual” organization that allows a greater percentage of our income to be devoted directly to dissemination programs.

The Bottom Line: This is a limited overview of just how much the Fellowship accomplishes through the efforts of our volunteers and a handful of dedicated workers. We have a growing interfaith presence and more people have heard of _The Urantia Book_ than ever before. We help reader communities grow internationally and 900 Urantia Books have been distributed to military units around the world. We have yearly social gatherings, large and small, sponsored by The Fellowship and its Societies. The Pipeline of Light sends books to people in many nations who are unable to afford the book. Extensive educational information is available to people all over the world in multiple languages through our website. Books in all the translated languages are available for sale or review on our website. Audio downloads of the book from our website have become extremely popular. 

This is because of you, volunteering your time and donating to our efforts. Let’s all stay focused about our Father’s work!

## We Are All In This Together

By _John Hay_, the Fellowship Finance Committee

I’m sure you don’t need to be told that we’re presently experiencing a very serious crisis of confidence in the financial marketplace; it’s most likely we’ll all be feeling the pinch. That being said, the revelation is even more vital to Urantia then ever before. _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship needs to be even more active in spreading these extraordinary teachings than ever before.

In order to get this done, we need your financial support, yes even in these difficult times, to help us pay the bills and keep up with the increased demand for more books and their dissemination throughout the world.

Without question the most efficient way to contribute is to sign up for the “AUTO DEBIT PROGRAM”, the gift that keeps giving.
1. Go on-line at www.urantiabook.org
2. Click on contributions at top of page.
3. Fill out secure information and choose the amount you wish to contribute.

Or you can call us at 303-467-7858 and we can set you up over the phone.

Your tax deductible contribution is our only source of income. Without your support we will perish, so please give what you can. 

When you sign up for $30 per month ($1 a day) or more, you will receive a FREE leather bound gold leaf Urantia Book and a complete set of Papers 122 through 154 of The Life and Teachings of Jesus on CD for easy listening. If you sign up for $20 per month we will send you the leather bound book. These gifts are our way of saying Thanks for being there when we need you most. 

Of course you are more than welcome to contribute by just sending a check to us at Urantia Book Fellowship, PO Box 4583, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163. 

You may ask, “Just what will my contribution be used for?” 

In just the last year, our distribution of _The Urantia Book_ has increased over 20% from last year. This does not include all the books that have been given away through a number of wonderful projects, such as the 900 books that were distributed to the combat troops in the middle-east this summer, and those that have been distributed into Central and South America through a joint program with Urantia Foundation, as well as the 1000 books that are earmarked for India in 2009. We need to thank Buck Weimer, Susan Ransbottom, Agustin Arellano, and the entire International Fellowship Committee and many others for making extraordinary inroads into these new pastures. 

Then there is David Kantor’s mind boggling IT and Website projects. Here’s what’s going on there. 

Growth in the international use of our website resource continues to develop. What are people looking for that leads them to our website? Where are they coming from? 

By far, the number one source of visitors is Internet search engines, such as Google and Yahoo. Out of a total of 3,698,053 validated requests for web pages between January and September of 2008, incredibly 582,440 were for audio files—mostly downloading _The Urantia Book_ audio version, but there were also requests for Bill Sadler’s recordings and over 10,000 requests for Dr. Chris Halvorson’s study group talks. 

Our website (www.urantiabook.org) is visited by individuals from virtually every country on the planet with the top locations (outside of North America) being: Russia, 115,075; Mexico, 106,039; Spain, 34,125; Colombia, 30,193; Australia, 29,736; Argentina, 23,608, and France, 20,058, just to name a few; and the list includes such interesting entries as South Africa, 5,071; Philippines, 1,269; US Military, 3,259; Cuba, 146; Saudi Arabia, 80; and Uzbekistan, 15. 

Clearly this is a potent resource in the effort to engage in global dissemination of _The Urantia Book_. This next year will see a new and unique marketing effort undertaken to capitalize on the gains made with the internet over the past decade. 

Again, none of these programs are possible without your donation. So please give what you can. 

The Good ship “Urantia” has steamed out of the safe harbor and is now charting her new course upon the high seas of her future destiny. Welcome aboard!!

## Stories from the Pipeline Fall 2008

By _Michelle Klimesh_

I would like to share two stories about people who have been touched by the kind generosity of our Pipeline donors and volunteers.

Gilbert Rosec, Paris - Agustin Arellano was in France in 2006 following the Barcelona World Parliament of Religions. While traveling on the Paris metro system, Agustin met Gilbert Rosec, a man returning home after a lengthy hospital stay.

Agustin struck up a conversation with him and was amazed to learn that Gilbert had been looking for _The Urantia Book_ for quite some time without success. As luck would have it, Agustin’s book supply had been stolen in Barcelona, and the only books he had left were three French copies of _The Urantia Book_ that he left in his hotel during the Parliament. So of course Agustin gave Gilbert one of his remaining books.

Gilbert continues to write to Agustin; he has since found a “pocket size” copy to bring along with him wherever he goes, and the original book that Agustin gave Gilbert is now his “pillow book.”

### The IC’08 Maids, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA

Pipeline volunteers were absolutely delighted to send four El Libros to four Spanish-speaking women in Los Angeles following IC’08 this summer. Maria, Maria, Rosa, and Mirna had several conversations with members of the Arias family, Nelida Oliver, and Agustin while they were working as maids on the UCLA campus during our conference. It happens from time to time that a Urantia Book reader from another country comes to the US and turns people on to the book; and this exchange is particularly sweet. Thanks to the Latin Americans for seeing an opportunity that was right under our noses!

As of this writing, the Pipeline has placed eighteen hundred and eighty-five books into sixty-one countries around the world. We deeply appreciate your continuing financial help. If you would like to contribute to this work, conations can be made online at: www.urantiabook.org/support or by mail to: _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, 9190 West 90th Place, Westminster, CO 80021. 

## Retired Air Force Officer Places Books in Military Units Overseas

Pamela L. Burr, a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the US Air Force and a UB reader who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, recently initiated “Operation Reach-back”, a project of placing Urantia Books in the hands of U.S. servicemen in military units deployed around the world. The Fellowship approved backing the project in August, has raised funds to offset the shipping expenses and has allocated the 900 books needed for the project out of its inventory.

When asked what prompted her to initiate this project, Pamela said: 

“I had been praying to the Father and asking him to show me how I could best be of service to him when I got his tasking…. i.e. “perform outreach ministry to the men and women of the military in deployed locations.” Being retired military myself, and having supported military operations in the desert, I had an appreciation for needs of these young military members putting their lives on the line so we can enjoy the freedoms we live by.”

Pamela at first thought that she would place a few books in deployed units in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. But after her getting in touch with The Fellowship, the scope of the project grew exponentially. Pamela took great pains to identify deployed units in 14 countries overseas that had requested donations of religious books. She then proceeded to supply them with Urantia Books, personally shipping volumes she received from The Fellowship. As of this writing, all 900 books have been shipped to military units worldwide.

The books were shipped with an introductory letter from Pamela including a short description of _The Urantia Book_, her contact information, and contact information of The Fellowship. So far, a few “thank you” notes were received from soldiers in units that have received the books. The Fellowship is working on ways to make Internet access and communication easy for any of the service men and women who wish to be in touch. Pamela can be reached at urantia_reach_back@yahoo.com.

## IC ‘08 A Conference To Fondly Remember

By _Stephen Zendt_ in collaboration with _David Holt_

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2008_Winter/005696.jpg">
</figure>


Sometimes great things really come in smaller packages. From the perspective of the three months just past, looking back at IC-08 in Los Angeles, the Conference still carries multi-layered memories of fine people and good times. It was quite an experience! 

Though attendance was less, the quality of location and planning was high. A feeling like that of a big family reunion continued throughout the whole series of events. And a sense of fellowship pervaded the entire Conference, as though people were eager to fraternize over and above debatable issues and beliefs. Thanks to all the people who put in such devoted work to make this a real success! 

The workshops and study sessions had good attendance, with many perspectives to share; a lot of good teaching and discussion to be had. In fact, if you had the stamina, you might have been wrapped up in session after session, every day.

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2008_Winter/005697.jpg">
</figure>


UCLA is a large campus. However, our Conference was concentrated in a main building just a congenial walking distance from sleeping quarters. In the courtyard of the Sunset Village dorms, there was a bamboo grove with outdoor benches that became a nightly social gathering place. Many old friends reacquainted themselves, there. 

Within Covel Commons, the headquarters building, there is a circular staircase that winds up from the dining rooms to the top floor where the bookstore, art gallery, and meeting rooms were located. Urantia folks from all over went up and down those stairs, all day and into the evening, like an M. C. Escher drawing.

The musicians, energized no doubt by their pre-conference retreat at Christina Seaborn’s mother’s home in Fullerton, provided more than entertainment—especially at the morning plenary sessions. The Pato Banton opening plenary came out of the gates flying. He and his group energized us so much that many people got up and started dancing in the aisles and on the small stage in front of the musicians. Pato has evolved into new forms of spiritual outreach alongside his music, and his sincerity touched us all.

The next morning it was the women who graced us with moving and uplifting energy. The women’s plenary demonstrated an interweaving of music, talking presentations, dance, a poem, a varied pageant that brought spiritual refreshment to everyone present. Francyl Gawryn made a smashing musical comeback after some years away and brought down the house. Barbara Hester’s choir composition was a highlight of the morning and if all goes well her full musical may reach the London stage. The speakers, singers, and dancers made us laugh, listen, and observe everything they offered to us, with delight in their skillful, moving presentations.

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2008_Winter/005698.jpg">
</figure>


Each morning plenary had riches to share in abundance. When the young folks came back to join us, after their adventure on Catalina Island, we had an intimate look into the lives and the perspectives of youth who were unafraid to share their inner life with us.

By the time we arrived at the Costume Ball, the creativity and good humor were totally delightful! We even met a “Miss Universe of Universes”. Such variety and wit along with good food and drink made the evening flow and the conviviality infectious.

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2008_Winter/005699.jpg">
</figure>

Off the top floor at Covel was a wide porch overlooking the campus. On the 4th  of July, we observed plumes of fireworks rising from areas beyond the trees and university buildings. Yet, it was one of the most low-key Fourths I can recall in many years.

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2008_Winter/005700.jpg">
</figure>


One singular event spoke to the new attitude of cooperation. Urantia Foundation, the UAI, and _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship held a joint open meeting to talk about plans for the future and to introduce the President of each organization and one or two key staff members. Questions from the audience were gathered on cards and submitted.

Cordial and collegial were important attitudes in each person’s presentation. The event carried out a hopeful theme of outreach in a new way, rising above partisanship. 

In fact, if there was anything that marked this conference for me as excellent, it had to be the maturity and mastery of so many participants, teachers, and administrators demonstrating a powerful service of teamwork and awareness of higher purpose.

## Urantia Society of Greater New York Celebrates 20th Anniversary

By _Barbara Dreier_

<figure id="Figure_16" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">

</figure>

On Saturday night, October 27th, more than 50 members and friends of the Urantia Society of Greater New York celebrated the society’s 20th anniversary at the Manhattan home of Robin and Helene Jorgensen. President Nick Curto welcomed the group with a toast and read a note of congratulations from Urantia Book Fellowship president, Robert Burns. Charter member, Bobbie Dreier, shared some memories from the society’s chartering at the Morris Yacht Club on City Island. Many friends came from afar to join in the celebration. Among them were John Hales and Tom Choquette who had attended the society’s chartering in 1988 as members of Urantia Brotherhood’s Charter Committee. 

Urantia Society of Greater New York has met regularly for 20 years to conduct business, provide study programs, to fellowship and gather for worship. Their voting membership averages 25 readers, and most take an active part in some aspect of society functioning. The society has held many regional meetings and spring and fall retreats.

USGNY has an active local outreach program chaired by Robin Jorgensen. The committee has produced an “Introduction to _The Urantia Book_” slide show, UB buttons, and also provides a presence at a variety of local fairs and events, participates in at least two expos a year, and maintains the society’s website www.urantia-nyc.org.

The society’s Russian and Korean translations of _The Urantia Book_ were accomplished through the devoted time and effort of Lila Dogim (Russian) and Kay and Barry Clark (Korean). The Fellowship’s Korean affiliate’s letter of congratulations and gratitude to the society for the translation was read to the group. Barry’s website, www.theuniversalfather.org, hosts downloadable versions of most Urantia Book translations.

Members of the New York society have held many leadership positions in the Fellowship and chaired several international conferences. Steve Dreier and Avi Dogim are former presidents and many others have been and continue to be members of the Executive Committee and General Council.

The evening was a spirited celebration of the renewal of old friendships and the delight of making new ones. On the eve of its 20th birthday, Urantia Society of Greater New York looked forward to many more years of loving service to the revelation.

Saturday, September 13 was the date of our Wisconsin Society of Urantia Book Readers Fall Conference. What a wonderful conference it was! We met at a small rustic, cozy farm in the Cascade, WI area, a unique piece of property, snuggled like a bug in a rug amidst lush green trees and grass. Here you’ll find the Field of Errors—a baseball field where you play to have fun and are free to make mistakes.

On another area off in the distance is the hand-forged first church of the Urantia movement that I’m aware of, the Chapel of the Searching and the Floundering. (Do you see a pattern here, errors, floundering…? We are human after all.) Jeannie, the property owner, a Urantia ‘listener,’ tells us that she and her husband, Dwayne, an avid Urantia ‘reader’ who is now carrying out his adventures in the next world, built the chapel from scratch, using all recycled materials. Inside are two recycled church pews, floral carpet, small but beautiful stained glass window hangings, electric candle lights, a very old-fashioned organ, a rustic pulpit, and charm. Outside it looks like a classic church building, complete with steeple.

Today, it was open the doors and see all the people as we enjoyed a presentation on the “Faith of Jesus” as given by longtime Urantia Book reader, Rosemary. I did a presentation called “The Eternal Purpose of Faith” based on Part I of _The Urantia Book_. Vicki, another longtime reader, spoke about the “Faith as Taught by Jesus of Nazareth” based on several key areas of Part IV of _The Urantia Book_.

After a great day of study, fellowship, and delicious food (Wisconsin brats, burgers, famous Sheboygan rolls, hot potato salad, Italian pasta salad, homemade pickles, crock pot beans, carrot cake and other treats,) a recipe for success, we all made our way back home to the four corners of the country and state. Rejuvenated and enlightened, we’re ready for the next Urantia conference.

Searching, floundering, and making mistakes—God love us all! Amen to that! 

## Colombia Groups Gather in Bogota

On April 20th (Earth Day), Gerald Pando and his wife, Bibi Morales hosted a 7th anniversary party for Exito Verde (Green Success), a Colombia based not for profit foundation whose mission is to preserve and improve the environment. The party was held in the newly renovated Teusaquillo House which is owned by Pando and is situated in the center of Bogota.

“As part of the anniversary celebration, we invited all social groups that use the property”, said Pando. He indicated that the Urantia groups of Bogotá were “in full attendance”, representing all economic levels and many years of readership. Among the hundred or so people present, he said, were Juan Petro, President of the Urantia Groups of Colombia, Myriam Montanez, whom many readers met at IC 96, Jose Manuel who has been active since _The Urantia Book_ arrived in Colombia and Carlos Zapata, a long time reader, who helped in coordinating the transport of materials and food for the party.

In addition to helping Exito Verde celebrate its 7th anniversary, Pando used the event to invite all Urantia Book reader groups in Colombia to use the property for the purpose of study and dissemination of the book and encouraged them to cooperate with each other. He sees a bright future for Teusaquillo House as a center of Urantia group related activities.
