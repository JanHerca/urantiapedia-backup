## It’s a Friendly Universe: Serving with Our Celestial Family

**Summer Study Session July 19 - 22, 2018**
**Techny Towers Conference and Retreat Center**

The tradition of gathering for study, fellowship, and prayer continues this summer at SSS’18. The summer study session provides an intimate atmosphere for enjoying conversation with old friends and new.

We will meet once again on the beautiful grounds of Techny Towers, in Northbrook, Illinois. This year’s meaningful theme has inspired many wonderful workshops and speeches. Plenary speakers Diane Labrecque, Derek Samaras, Chuck Thurston, and Chris Wood will share their insights on “It’s a Friendly Universe: Serving with our Celestial Family.” This is a compelling line-up composed of significant contributors to our community.

### Pre-Conference Retreat

A pre-conference retreat, facilitated by Gard Jameson and friends, will offer “Faith, TRUST and Assurance: The Experience of Real Religion.” The retreat will be held from Tuesday evening, July 17, through Thursday, July 19, at noon. Based on the work of Parker Palmer in his book, A Hidden Wholeness, the retreat is a meditative soul-sharing experience designed to help deepen one’s spiritual consciousness. Contact Bobbie Dreier at bdreier@earthlink.net with questions.

### Workshops

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2018_Summer/005930.jpg">
</figure>

Attendees can expect a variety of high quality workshops for advanced and new readers. A sampling includes a workshop by David Glass, which will be a participatory workshop with attendees sharing some of the ways that their faith in a friendly universe has assisted them in their planetary sojourn so far. It will ask the question “How does Jesus’ faith in a friendly universe reframe or shed light on our understanding of his response to some of his more trying life crises?”

Gard Jameson’s workshop is titled “**Experiencing Our Friendly Universe Through Compassionate Service.**” This workshop will focus upon the eight beatitudes as the blueprint for experiencing our friendly universe.

David Kulieke and Neda Tehrani will present “**The Life Affirmations in a Friendly Universe**” This workshop will examine the profound implications of the assurances from _The Urantia Book_ that our lives have meaning.

Paula Thompson’s workshop will focus on the aspect of theme that **explores serving with our celestial family**. As she shares, “Nothing gives us an understanding of who the angels are and how they work in the realms of human endeavors quite like _The Urantia Book_, Paula will offer a lively and insightful look at how to be able to work with them for the betterment of humanity.

### 3rd Year In-Depth Study Workshop

**Spirit Family: The Trinity As The Source Of Family**, Friday, July 20, 2018

**Early Bird Announcement!**

The in-depth study sub-committee of the Fellowship Education Committee writes:

It is our pleasure and honor to participate with you in an all-day, in-depth study experience at the 2018 Summer Study Session.

In-depth study of scripture and revelation (or philosophy, literature, science, etc.) can be deeply transforming, facilitating a creative interplay between worship, study, service, and refreshing leisure. We hope together we may create a spiritual milieu in which our souls feel safe to be touched and commune. In-depth study demands a slower process, deep thinking. We often may struggle for words and clear communication among us during in-depth study conversation. Transforming in-depth study leads us to new or renewed communion with the Heavenly Father and the divine within.

Plan to spend one full day with us in deep reflection on this year’s topic: **Spirit Family: The Trinity As The Source Of Family**. During this workshop, we will reflect on and discuss in depth how each child of God is directly connected to the trinity; how the trinity models for finite mortals the values of family life; what some of the most important spiritual values and meanings are that we can apply to family life; and how the roles and functions of family members differ and overlap. We will review some techniques Jesus used in rearing his family and contemplate friendship/friendliness from a spiritual perspective.

All participants are welcome. Please consider if you are willing to:
- Pre-register for the workshop
- Complete the pre-workshop readings (20-25 pages of excerpts from _The Urantia Book_, to be sent out in early June)
- Read Papers 6-10 and be prepared to discuss questions

Also sign up for the Spiritual Retreat(*), July 17-19, 2018. Contact Bobbie Dreier at bdreier@earthlink.net for more in-formation
- Attend the full-day session on Friday and a breakfast sharing on Sunday
- Bring two questions of your own to share with the group
- Bring any art work, music, poetry, stories, essays, and personal experiences – created by you or others –related to our theme

We hope you will join us in this activity!

(*)If you cannot attend this pre-conference retreat, you may substitute prior attendance at a similar retreat.

### Worship

The worship theme for SSS’18 is The Relationship of Worship and Service. “Worship is the technique of looking to the One for the inspiration of service to the many” (143:7.6). The Worship Committee has planned several events in order to create an occasion “pervaded by an atmosphere of communion.” You may attend quiet contemplative meditation in the Africa Chapel before breakfast and dinner each day; gather to contemplate our heavenly Father together prior to the plenary sessions. Sunday we will gather and share a special morning of worship with related activities.

### It’s a Friendly Universe Gala

On Saturday night we will join together to celebrate our friendly universe. The planning committee will host a Gala intended to give everyone a chance to relax, lighten up and enjoy each other’s company. If you’d like to participate and/or have ideas to enhance and bring fun to our Gala, please contact Jackie Koury at jacquelyn. koury@gmail.com

### Expedition to Eden

During our Friday night social, interested parties may choose to enjoy a beverage and then join Commodore Robert Bates in an adjacent room as he presents, “Expedition to Eden: A special up-date about the ongoing archaeological search for the First Garden.” He will share his new interpretation of the data. You may know that “Captain Bates” was the expedition leader and partner with Robert Sarmast in 2004 and again in 2006.

### Family Life
This summer’s program will also feature a Family Life Panel discussion designed to educate, support, and encourage family participation in revelation activities. Many spiritually inspired materials have been created and will be available to attendees.

### Introduction to _The Urantia Book_

Once again an “Introduction to _The Urantia Book_” will be presented. It is designed for friends and family members who would like to know more about your devotion to the book.

### Informational Panel

The planning committee is organizing a workshop panel designed to bring us up-to-date with some of the many projects our fellow readers are involved in. This includes an introduction to our brand new and soon to be launched “Urantia Book Study Group Directory.” This new website has been a shared project of the Foundation, Fellowship, and UAI. Attendees will also have an opportunity to learn about the work being done in connection with “The International Center for Urantia Studies.” If you would like to add to this panel regarding a project that is of value to our community, please contact David Kulieke.

### Study Group Conclave

The Fellowship Education Committee, which organizes the summer study sessions, again will host a Study Group Conclave. During this session creating and presenting workshops and enhancing study will be explored.

### TDA and General Council

The Triennial Delegate Assembly, for delegates from each Fellowship society to elect new General Councilors and offer resolutions, will precede the Summer Study Session on July 18-19. The meeting of the General Council, which is open to visitors, will follow the SSS on Sunday afternoon, July 22, and continue until July 24.

### Call For Volunteers

On-site volunteers will be needed to help with registration, in the book store, and with technical tasks – AV and IT. It’s an opportunity for service! Please consider how you might help, and contact David Kulieke at david.kulieke@gmail.com. Thank you.

The Planning Committee has many more presentations and engaging activities planned to foster growth and heartwarming fellowship.

Summer Study Session time is drawing near! Have you registered? You may register for the conference and the retreat at www.regonline.com/Urantia_Fellowship_SSS18

Please contact Paula Thompson at 303-467-7858 with questions about registration.

## GC Openings

There are a total of 36 seats on the General Council (GC) and at least 12 of those seats will open up for election this summer. To be eligible, a person must be a member of the Fellowship, either a Member at Large or a Society Member. The Fellowship’s constitution requires that you must have read _The Urantia Book_ in its entirety, at least one time, as the other prerequisite for service. To read more about the General Council from our Constitution, go here: http://www.urantia-book.org/Constitution/Constitution2013-02-09.pdf

General Councilors are typically elected by the Triennial Delegate Assembly (TDA). Every three years representatives from regional Urantia societies come together with the task of selecting or re-electing 12 full term Councilors. A full term lasts for 9 years. Occasionally someone resigns before their term has expired. The GC fills this seat temporarily until the TDA can elect someone to finish the remainder of that person’s term.

Membership on the GC involves attending just two meetings per year. Meetings are held over a weekend and in a variety of locations across North America. Meetings typically occur in February (in a mild climate) and again at the close of, and in conjunction with, the Fellowship’s summer conference. General Council meetings begin on Friday evening for about 4 hours, then resume on Saturday morning for 8 hours and again on Sunday morning, ending at noon. Saturday night is usually held open for a social with readers from the area where the meeting is held. We vary the location of the meetings to allow for his fellowship and to facilitate local readers getting to know the leaders of the Fellowship. This event is often a highlight at Council meetings. Sometimes another day may be added to the GC meeting for a retreat.

Meeting agendas typically consist of reports by the officers, and standing committee chairs, discussion of policy, and proposals for new arenas of service and dissemination. Meetings are presided over by the Fellowship’s President and are run according to Roberts Rules of Order

It’s important to note that Councilors must be able to cover their own costs to attend meetings. This includes travel to the meeting, hotel room, and meals. Occasion financial assistance may be available to Councilors if circumstances leave them unable to meet these expenses.

Being on the Fellowship’s General Council is an amazing experience. Some General Councilors have served for 2, 3, and 4 9-year terms. Lifelong friendships are established and the beauty of deliberation, group wisdom, and teamwork is illuminated in remarkable and inspiring ways.

If, after reading this and checking in with our Father, you feel you would like to join the long list of General Councilors who have served the Urantia movement faithfully for 62 years, fill out the application at: http://www.urantiabook.org/Default.aspx?PageID=14753845&A=SearchResult&SearchID=15288748&ObjectID=14753845&ObjectType=1 or search for “Application for Organizatonal Seervice”.

## Spreading the Joy of the Revelation

Have you ever wondered what your life would have been like without _The Urantia Book_? We at the Fellowship have asked ourselves this question, and we find we can’t imagine life without the revelation; and that has profoundly determined our constant efforts to spread the revelation to the world.

We have many projects going among our societies, committees, and even individuals who take on special projects on their own. One project which has engrossed the Fellowship for some time is the Pipeline of Light. The Pipeline is an effort of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship to get all translations of _The Urantia Book_ into the hands of people around the world, especially those in developing countries. It was our response to a need presented in the 1990s by people from Estonia, Mexico, and Chile. In one instance there were 100 sincere revelation students sharing just one Spanish Urantia Book.

In just the first quarter of 2018 the Pipeline placed 456 copies of _The Urantia Book_ into seven countries. With a ready supply of affordable translations from Urantia Foundation and donations to the Pipeline books were given to readers and study groups in Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, the United States, Peru, Australia, and Columbia. Books sent out this quarter include 428 Spanish translations and 28 English books. Current efforts bring the Pipeline grand totals to 8,309 copies placed into 90 countries around the world.

For three decades the Fellowship’s Outreach Committee has been highly active in a variety of ways. Concentrating especially in the U.S., this committee sends volunteers to book fairs, college campuses, and other venues to present _The Urantia Book_ to people from all walks of life. Most of them have never heard of the book before. Interested readers at these presentations may also receive a free Urantia Book on request by filling out a card provided by the Fellowship representative. Through the Outreach Committee Urantia Books are now reaching new readers around the country via a prison book program. The response in this area is encouraging.

To keep all of our readers informed of Fellowship community building activities, the Publications Committee produces three different types of communications: a monthly online newsletter, the Mini Messenger, a printed, twice annual Mighty Messenger with news of upcoming events, and the Fellowship Herald featuring the best thoughts and insights of individuals who have been inspired by the revelation. These are only some of the projects engaging the members of the Fellowship for over 60 years, but costs, needs, and opportunities have continued to increase. You have helped bring wonderful accomplishments about in the past, but there is so much more that we can and must do to bring this revelation to the world.

Please donate to the Fellowship.

## Agondonter Boot Camp Society Conference

In 1974 David Glass toured Florida seeding Urantia Books and seeking readers. In 1975 the first Statewide Florida Conference for Readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held in the Unity Church in Tampa. Readers continued to meet annually and in1989 Florida study groups united to form Florida Students of _The Urantia Book_ and sponsored the first FSUB conference. The tradition has continued and this year the conference was sponsored by the newly chartered Agondonter Boot Camp Society.

Held at the Day Spring Conference Center in Parrish, Florida over the weekend of February 9th 30 readers ranging in age from nine to 83 studied, worshiped and enjoyed each other’s company. On Friday evening Sheryl Cira led a “getting to know you” activity. Steve Dreier, former Fellowship president and currently its secretary was the keynote speaker and opened the session with the conference theme, “The Art of Getting Along with Others.” Attendees enjoyed the practical focused small group sharing that followed and the “spiritual experience sharing session” led by Doreen Heyne.

The conference blended activities for body, mind and spirit with early morning yoga led by Jack Miller, the conference program developed by Kurt Cira, and worship sessions conducted by Susan Meyers. Children who attended participated by making announcements and conducting the traditional silent auction which helps support society activities.

Conference organizers left time for renewing old relationships and making new ones and a great time was had by all. The conference “rapped” with a duet, “All Star” by Smashmouth, performed by 11 year old Solonia Deoto and her dad Willy.

## Reflections on Unity

**Opinion**

By _Avi Dogim_

As Jesus was beginning his public work, he said to the apostles:

> _You do not have to see alike or feel alike or even think alike in order spiritually to be alike. Spiritual unity is derived from the consciousness that each of you is indwelt, and increasingly dominated, by the spirit gift of the heavenly Father. Your apostolic harmony must grow out of the fact that the spirit hope of each of you is identical in origin, nature, and destiny._ ([UB 141:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p5_1))

There has been much talk lately about “unity” in Urantia Fellowship circles. There had been meetings between Fellowship and UAI representatives to explore the subject. And the subject in this case was the possible merger of the two organizations.

It seems to me that most UB readers who are aware of the existence of these organizations would view such merger as a positive thing. And, indeed, why not? Why shouldn’t there be unity among the two primary social organizations dedicated to the dissemination of the fifth epochal revelation on Urantia? And isn’t it time, after all these years since the 1989 split between The Urantia Brotherhood and Urantia Foundation, that things coalesce back to the way they were meant to be?

These yearnings should not be dismissed as mere sentimentality. One could argue that they emanate from that same soulful ideal that longs to see a world-government presiding over a peaceful planet and ensuring the freedom and well-being of all its human inhabitants.

Yet, we know that a world government will not become a reality before the world’s governments evolve toward greater and greater mutual cooperation and harmony as they become increasingly aware of their interdependency. Likewise, an attempt to unify two human organizations such as the Fellowship and the UAI before they learn to cooperate as equals and coexist harmoniously can only result in disappointment.

Learning to cooperate and collaborate on projects is something we should certainly do. There was a conference last year in San Antonio where there was substantial collaboration between the local USUA group and the Fellowship. There are exploratory talks going on now between the Fellowship and the UAI about a future large joint conference. We don’t know what will become of it. But the fact that we are talking is a very good thing.

There are differences in organizational structure and culture between the Fellowship and the UAI. These differences need to be understood and appreciated as members of both organizations interact with each other and get to know each other better. The fact that there seems to be an increase in the number of people affiliated with one organization attending conferences organized by the sister organization – indeed members of one organization assist in the planning and logistical support of the other’s conferences – is a hopeful sign. Moreover, it is heartening to see that many individuals, on either side of the organizational split, did not allow that split to stand in the way of their friendship.

The fact of our spirit unity, demonstrable by our pursuit of identical universe goals, cannot be denied. It may well happen at some future time that as we continue to collaborate with these goals in mind that our respective creeds, to the degree they exist, will diminish in their ability to divide us. Perhaps then we can talk about organizational unity. Or perhaps then it may not matter much. 

## Repercussions of the Bestowal of Christ Michael: An Introduction to _The Urantia Book_

**A New RMSF Sponsored Project at Urantia Book Films**

Most introductions to _The Urantia Book_ suffer from being overly self-referential or overly reliant on fringe metaphysics. Repercussions of the Bestowal of Christ Michael will provide an accessible introduction to the book for seeking Christians by placing it in its historical context, highlighting the evolutionary heritage which prepares the way for epochal revelation.

Apocryphal stories say that the revelators relied on questions from humans to guide them in their construction of the revelation. A study of our past in conjunction with a reading of _The Urantia Book_ shows us what some of those questions might have been. The history of Christian thought reveals spiritual confusion and metaphysical enigmas which have troubled sincere religionists for two thousand years. With insight into its conceptual ancestry, _The Urantia Book_ comes alive in its evolutionary context, exposing new horizons of meaning for its readers.

Repercussions also highlights some of the known and lesser known men and women who have played catalytic roles in the continuing unfolding of the potentials precipitated by the bestowal. It begins with a review of basic concepts pervasive in Jesus’ world and how they subsequently were impacted by—and integrated with—ideas springing from his life and teachings. The film then traces the evolutionary development of these concepts through the key periods of Christian history up to their synthesis and further illumination in _The Urantia Book_.

The visual texture of Repercussions follows the evolution of worship spaces in church architecture. It is based on the overview provided by Jeanne Halgren Kilde in her book, Sacred Power, Sacred Space: An Introduction to Christian Architecture and Worship. It will draw heavily on the stained glass and architecture of Denver regional churches while including some of the major Christian worship spaces from around the world. 

The Bestowal of Christ Michael is being produced for distribution on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. It is intended to provide a definitive introduction to _The Urantia Book_ as well as providing a context within which existing readers might more fully appreciate the depth and scope of the fifth epochal revelation.

Projected release date: Easter 2020

Estimated run time: Between 60 and 90 minutes

Current production team includes David Kantor, Lowel Pierce, MaryJo Garascia, (each an RMSF member) Alexandra Taylor, and Kelly Andrew, as well as a several technical consultants and an indispensable group of financial supporters. The folks at Watkins Stained Glass in Englewood, Colorado, who have done glass work and restoration on more than 300 regional churches, are providing art history consultation.

Urantia Book Films is an outreach project supported by Rocky Mountain Spiritual Fellowship. A trailer for the film may be viewed at https:/www.vimeo.com/urantia/repercussions

## Urantia Speaks

Urantia Speaks is a new, original format, and virtual assembly of UB participants, in a circle of fellowship we are gathered in the study of this spiritual revelatory masterpiece, joined in a shared experience of loving ministry, contemplative reciting, and the higher cosmic learning of the sublime teachings of the Urantia material.

We’re thoughtfully exploring, sharing, and realizing in these exalted narrations, supernal truths, discovered in these extraordinary, and most beautiful 5th epochal revelations; we’re opening ourselves to a newfound experiential enlightenment of the Universal, Eternal, and Infinite Creators, their divine associates, the farflung cosmic family of creation, the origin, nature, and destiny of innumerable personality orders, the structure and organization of the vast universe of universes, and a spectacular, comprehensive revelatory presentation of the life, and teachings of Christ Michael. Throughout the Urantia Papers we find a profound revelation of the evolution, purpose, and plan for each person, humanity, and our world Urantia encompassing the endless circle of the eternal ages!
