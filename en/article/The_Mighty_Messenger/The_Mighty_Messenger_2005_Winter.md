## General Council To Meet in Dallas

Dallas will host the mid-year meeting of the Fellowship General Council January 27-29, 2006. The Council meeting will begin at 7:00 P.M. on Friday, January 27 and continue throughout the day on Saturday, the 28th at the Courtyard by Marriott, DFW Airport South, Irving, TX.

The Councilors look forward to fellowshipping with Texas readers at a Saturday evening social. This opportunity to visit old friends and make new ones is always a highlight of the tnid-year meetings. _Urantia Book_ readers are also invited to observe the Council meeting and acquaint themselves with its functions and purposes.

For further information, contact the Fellowship at fellowship@urantiabonk.org or call 1-877-288-3772.

## Time to Begin TDA Preparations

The summer of 2006 may seen far off when compared to the busy day-to-day schedules we have. But nine months from now, representatives from active societies will meet to reconstitute The Fellowship's General Council.

Within the next seven months, each society should be making plans to hold a Triennial Election for Delegate and Alternate. One society, Orvonton Society, has been inactive for several years is currently moving forward with plans to become an active participant in this vital process. An inactive society simply needs to hold an election of officers, according to the procedures specified in their society's constitution, and notify The Fellowship of the results. The society then holds an election for a Delegate and Alternate to represent them at the TDA. Fot an individual to represent a society at the TDA, he or she must be a member of that local society and have read _The Urantia Book_ in its entirety.

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship's Triennial Delegate Assembly of Society Delegates and Alternates is scheduled to occur just prior to the next summer Study Session (SSS06). The TDA followed by the Summer Study Session, which in turn will be followed the General Council meeting. This is a Triennial Meeting of the Council and the newly constituted Council will elect five new officers to serve three-year terms and most likely several new committee chairs, depending on other elections. 

For information or clarification, please contact The Fellowship-office a fellowship@urantiabook.org.

## General Council Meeting of August 5 '05

The Annual Meeting of the General Council of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship was held on Friday, August 5, 2005 at the campus of Villanova University, Villanova, PA, following the conclusion of IC '05. 

A number of standing committee vacancies were filled. Dale Sztjenberg was elected to a 6 year term on Membership; Bob Buselli to a 6 year term on Judicial; Chick Montgomery to a 6 year term on Special Projects; Buck to a 6 year term on International Fellowship; Bobbie Dreier to a 6 year term on Outreach; Charlene Morrow to a 6 year term on Interfaith; Peter Laurence to a vacant position on Interfaith; Laura Hay to a 6 year term on Publications. Vacancies remain on the Finance and Education committees.

Vice President, Marvin Gawryn, reported on his efforts to interest the IUA in holding a joint International Conference with The Fellowship in the summer of 2008. The final response to thesc efforts came in a July letter from the IUA President, Gaetan Charland, to Mr. Gawryn, indicating that, for a number of reasons, the IUA cannot consider a joint conference with The Fellowship at this time. An extended discusion about Fellowship IUA relationship ensued, most Councilors expressing the hope that, in time, the more moderate voices on the IUA will prevail and joint projects between the two organizations will be possihle.

Treasurer, John Elay, reported on The Fellowship's new logo, which was voted on by more than 25% of the membership. General Councilor, Lenny Cowles, will be chairing an ad hoc committee to determine logo use.

President, Avi Dogitn, described the website management effort and the need to form a working group tasked with managing the website content. Formation of this group is now in process. 

Secretary, Steve Dreier, reported on the work of the Information Technology process of identifying The Fellowship's information gathering and processing needs. 

Judicial Committee Chairman, John Lange, distributed a paper listing seven preliminary ideas for updating the Fellowship Constitution and asked for comments and suggestions from General Councilors within two months. 

Membership Committee Chairman, Bob Bruyn suggested a plan to move dormant societies to inactive status while moving members of such societies to Member at Large (MAL) status until the society became active again. This will require society approval as well as a constitucional amendment.

Chairman of the Finance Committee, Robert Burns, reported that most of the Fellowship's income comes from a relatively small number of contributors. He would like to see the base increase and is hoping that the use of auto debit contributions will facilitate such increase. 

Susan Cook, Chairing the Interfaith Committee, reported that her committee is developing a survey to determine the degree of interest in interfaith work. She and Peter Laurence are developing a web-based course for an interfaith workshop. The committee is taking part in an interfaith gathering in Las Vegas in which younger people are being encouraged to participate.

Internacional Fellowship Committee Chair, David Kantor, reported that there is a great deal of study group activity in Mexico and Central America, largely due to the efforts of Agustine Arellano and Nelida Oliver. General Councilor, reported that there are now over 60 active groups in Mexico under the Orvonton banner —a registeted non-profit educational group in Mexico. There are 36 groups in Central America. These groups, as well as other groups in Latin Ametica, are in great need books. The cost of a _Urantia Book_ in Argentina, for example, can be $76. Extensive discussion about stimulating interest in _The Urantia Book_ worldwide ensued. General Councilor, Michelle Klimesh, who had coordinated the Pipeline of Light Project, which supplied books to needy groups, proposed pulling the project back into The Fellowship. 

On other dissemination efforts, Mary Jo Grascia of the Outreach Committee described the development of the speaker's bureau project. General Councilor, Thomas Orjala, reported on the Cosmic Café project, an experimentat effort drawing 10-20 people for an evening of discussion.

Education Committee Chair Gary Deinstadt, reponed that the Education website is up and developing. He announced that the theme of the Summer Study Session will be "Ot Unseen Friends". Dates and venue be finalized soon. The Triennial Delegate Assembly (TDA), which will be electing one-third of the General Council, will meet just prior to the beginning of the Summer Session.

## Pipeline of Light

_Michelle Klimesh_

The Pipeline of Light was launched three years ago to address the enormous demand for _The Urantia Book_ in countries where readers cannot afford them. When I first heard the story of a group of seventy readers in South America who were sharing eleven books between them, I knew I would be irresistibly drawn to this project. Groups of readers around the world are studying the revelation in extraordinary circumstances. How fortunate we are to be blessed with the resources to help them!

Here in the United States, where most of us could purchase books whenever we please, interest in the revelation grows slowly. Conversely, in countries where interest in _The Uruntia Book_ is growing by leaps and bounds, the price of the book may be several weeks' wages. It is ironic that in countries where per capita income hovers near $100 per MONTH, the retail price of _The Urantia Book_ can be two or three times what we pay in the States.

The Pipeline of Light project provides a flow of donated books in every available language to areas where readers can otherwise only dream of owning a personal copy of the revelacion. In the past year, Pipeline books have been delivered to Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, India, Nigeria, Senegal, Mexico, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Palestine, and throughout South America. Agustin Arellano Tirado (who has distributed 4500 _Urantia Books_ in the past five years, often using his own funds) has book-planting trips planned throughout Latin America over the next ten months. On this one continent alone, Agustin intends to fulfill nearly 500 book requests this year.

The presence of the Urantia revelation was strongly felt at the joint gathering of the United Religions Initiative and the North American Interfaith Network held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, August 14-16 this summer, due to the work of several dedicated _Urantia Book_ readers. The Urantia community hosted a banquet for the entice gathering, and also created sacred spaccs in which to celebrate different faith traditions. Actively serving in these activities were, back row, from left, Amee Majors, Charlene Morrow, Tamara Wood, Share Beasley, Susan Cook, Judy Langston and Gard Jameson. Front row, from left, Bill Beasley and Marvin Gawryn.

## Mazatlan Conference

Spontaneity led to closer personal relationships between the attendees at the 5th National Mexican Conference (the 3rd Conference of the Three Americas) held in Mazatlan, Mexico, from May 23 through May 29, 2005. The theme “The Paradise Trinity” was chosen by local students of _El Libro de Urantia_, and sponsored by Groupo Orvonton, A.C., led by General Councilor Agustin Arellano. A pattern of study and relaxation, work and play, characterized the conference, a highlight of which was the power point presentations of Nelida Oliver from Equador.

## Serving A Revelation

_Robert Burns_

Many reading this article serve the revelation. We do so, each in our own way. It is important take a moment every now and then to appreciate the work of others. Most of us serve so much! We serve our families, our work, our communities, and this revelation.

The Fellowship relies on countless hours of volunteer efforts for its very existence. Most of these hours of effort go unnoticed and unappreciated. These volunteers do not ask for appreciation, for how shallow would that be? And yet, we can show our appreciation by donating funds that allow them to do their projects which are spreading and socializing this epochal revelation. Think, the vast part of the world has yet to become aware of _The Urantia Book_ or its teachings, to even know that a new revelation is present and is beginning to operate on our world. Our volunteers need your financial support, for without these resources, they are unable to fulfill their service, unable to move forward. 

As we get caught up in the details of our own lives, it is easy to forget why _The Urantia Book_ is so important to this epochal revelation, what it might mean to future generations if we let down our charge, our responsibility to the fifth major, important revelation to our world. Once you see the light, even dimly, do you want to go back to the darkness of your previous ignorance? Can we let others stay unenlightened because we are not up to the task! 

Unfortunately, our planet is in spiritual darkness, _The Urantia Book_ is not an easy read, it is intellectually and morally demanding. Yet the message contained is clear: we, all of us on the planet, are to become brothers and sisters under the Fatherhood of God. As simple and easy as this is to understand, it will take years for this message to reach the hearts and souls of the mortals of this planet. It has to start somewhere. Let it be now. 

_The Urantia Book_ gives all of us the light to understand better out origins and the why of our existence. It explains our current status and it gives us the vision of our destiny! The information contained in the pages of _The Urantia Book_ gives our planet what it needs to fulfill the Brotherhood of mankind and the Fatherhood of God. This really is the trust placed in our hands. 

Our work for this revelation actually brings our planet closer to light and life. Be an active part by serving, loving, caring, and doing. 

So, once again, from the bottom of my heart, as well as from the countless others whose lives will be touched now and in the future of our planet, THANKS for all of your support and work. Please consider a generous donation to the Fellowship. Better yet, make it a monthly auto-debit fot $20 or more and we will send you the leather, bound edition of _The Urantia Book_ as our token of appreciation. (http://urantiabook.org/support.htm)

## Happy Birthday Meredith!

In April, 2005 the Fort Wayne _Urantia Book_ Society celebrated the 90th birthday of Meredith Sprunger. We here in Fort Wayne truly have been blessed to have the knowledge and insight of Meredith and Irene Sprunger as a regular part of our study of _The Urantia Book_.

## Making Spirit Matter: Reflections On IC 05

_Bobbie Dreier_

I look forward to internacional conferences. They bring together hundreds of Urantia Book readers, and the spiritual energy is palpable as we share our desire to do God's will. This year there were readers from thirteen countries.

Program planners provided a variety of high quality presentations and workshops that adhered closely to Urantia Book subjects. There were three simultaneous tracks (Science, Philosophy/Religion, and Experiential Spirituality) and it was diffhcult to make decisions. I joined Moussa N'Dyiaye's intensive eight-session seminar “How Does God Function Within Us?” which necessitated missing some workshops I had planned to attend, but this workshop was a transforming experience.

For many attendees the opportunity to share a time of silent spirit consciousness with hundreds of others is a conference highlight. This year we were invited to worship each morning via one of four pathways: Sensory Stimulation, Contemplation/Meditation, Service, and Progressing Value Levels. Each afternoon a “divine meditation” was offered also.

The Jerusalem Marketplace was held without a tent this year, and provided a meaningtful and enjoyable experience for the children. The devoted efforts of those who have developed programs for the youngsters, the teens and the young adults continue to provide appropriate and fun-filled experiences.

Evenings were filled with two music venues and a series of “Special Interest Groups.” Ir was a good time to hang around the lobbies to catch up with old friends and make new ones.

I can't end without mentioning the Gala 50th Anniversary Dinner, complete with the tables. Our revelation and a committnent to apply out energies to the future with the wholehearted devotion necessary to bring its loving message to the world. We have come a long way in fifty years and are inspired by future challenges. I know I speak for most of you when I say that the intellectual stimulation, the loving fellowship, and the spiritual renewal we experience at these large conferences energize us the work ahead.

A conference is made possible by the boundless service of its team. I offer heartfelt thanks to the Conference Co-Chairs, Lila Dogim and Doreen Heyne, and the amazing group of conference coordinators they assembled. In closing lid like to  share some comments overheard at the Galau...

_“I had the most wonderful time in my life.”_

_“This conference has changed my life.”_

_“This is a close to heaven as I've been!”_
