Join us in sunny Los Angeles July 2-6, 2008, on the UCLA campus for The
Urantia Book Fellowship’s International Conference, “The Thrill of Loving Service.” Registration begins on Monday, July 1, and attendees will be welcomed with a reception hosted by _The Urantia Book_ Los Angeles Society (UBLA). The opening plenary on Tuesday, July 2, will kick off an exciting week of worship, truth, friendship, spirit, and above all, service.

The beautiful UCLA campus is a relatively short drive from the LAX airport. There is a Super Shuttle for $16, taxis are $20, and rental cars are suggested if you want to tour Los Angeles on our light day, July 4.The campus has handicapped accessibility and is super easy to navigate. 

All workshops will be held in the same building and will be located on the same floor as The Expo, bookstore, art gallery, and information/registration center. Dormitories are only a few minutes walk from workshops and common areas. There is a cafeteria on campus, but also a food court with a variety of choices. A mile from campus is Westwood, which offers a wide selection of restaurants.

The theme “The Thrill of Loving Service” has been divided into three tracks. Beginning Service will explore the roots and requirements of service, personal ministry, and worship. Advanced Service will emphasize higher forms of service such as teaching, parenting, and service as a source of spiritual growth. Supreme Service will explore all these concepts at the highest level. The program consists of workshops, presentations, and panel discussions.

Music will be available every evening in the plenary room which has a terrace for both indoor and outdoor listening. Pato Banton, Common Ground, and many of our Urantia musicians will delight us with their music. The celebration will continue the conference tradition at the gala dinner the evening of Saturday, July 5, with delicious food and wonderful music.

Friday, July 4, will be a “light” day. You will have the opportunity to be on your own in L.A. or stay on campus and swim in your choice of two very nice swimming pools, enjoy a speakers and leaders session, and beginning and in-depth study groups. Please join us next summer and learn how thrilling loving service can be!

More details will be forthcoming. Registration begins in November. Please contact us at www.IC08.org for further information and a link to the registration form.


## International Readers’ Services Position Filled

By _Susan Ransbottom_

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/Agustin_Arellano.jpg">
</figure>

After several years of discussion and careful planning, the Fellowship has created a new, half-time staff position designed to serve readers outside of the North American culture and continent. Agustin Arellano, founder of Grupo Orvonton in Mexico and a former member of the General Council, was selected after an intensive and international hiring process.

Agustin is a linguist and is fluent in at least six languages. He is a life-time student of spiritual traditions and a devoted reader/believer of _The Urantia Book_ since the late 1970s. While working as a professional tour guide and language teacher, he introduced the book to other teachers and with their help, began translating individual papers to start the first study group in his home town of Mazatlan, Mexico in 1986. Within several years this group became so large that they began to meet on weekends at a member’s ranch in the mountains above Mazatlan. 

Agustin is creative in his outreach efforts, describing _The Urantia Book_ as something inclusive that can touch the life of any person who may be a truth seeker, or even simply curious. Through his travels he has introduced the book and started study groups in almost every country in Latin America, as well as Cuba, France, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, and even Asia. He is skilled at using the media (television, radio, internet, as well as newspapers and magazines) in his outreach efforts. 

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/Agustin_Arellano_2.jpg">
</figure>

Agustin recently finished his doctorate in Psychology from the National University of Mexico, specializing in Gestalt Therapy, and used models of Urantia Book study groups as the topic for both his Masters and PhD theses. He begins his paid position with the Fellowship as he starts his professional career as a therapist. 

The creation of this position marks a new commitment by the Fellowship to fulfill its mission of reaching out and serving “the peoples of the world”. We offer a warm welcome to Dr. Arellano and look forward to this expansion of Fellowship services throughout the Americas and beyond.

## Outreach In New York City

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">

<figcaption><em>Robin Jorgensen conducts a study group in his home in Manhattan following an introduction of</em> _The Urantia Book_ <em>at a New York City hotel.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

During the third weekend in October, New York readers participated in an introduction to _The Urantia Book_ at an Expo at the Hotel New Yorker. Nine people who came to the Expo later came to a Urantia Book study group at the home of Robin and Helene Jorgensen. With the New York Society serving as a support system for this effort, about thirty people gathered at the Jorgensen home in Manhattan. For over twenty years, the Jorgensens have opened their home to anyone interested in _The Urantia Book_. Their loving service includes doing a study group every week and two expos a year. Because of his experience doing the expos, Robin feels that those persons truly interested in _The Urantia Book_ teachings will attend his follow-up session a few days later. He gives out his contact information inviting them to a study group meeting where the new people can participate and study along with the rest of the group and then receive a gift book.

Great backup support for the Jorgensens’ outreach activities has been provided by the “core members” of the Tuesday night study group. If the Jorgensens are not available for some reason, the others hold the meeting at someone else’s home, or even a restaurant, so the momentum isn’t lost. Robin likes to point out “they really make all this stuff happen, we just open the door.” The Jorgensens are willing to share their comments on their experiences in outreach efforts and can be contacted at heleneandrobin@earthlink.net.

## Pipeline Of Light Report

By _Michelle Klimesh_, Pipeline Coordinator

During the third quarter of 2007, Pipeline of Light Volunteers placed a total of 111 copies of translations of _The Urantia Book_ into twelve countries including books to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, Nigeria, Ecuador, Zambia, Lithuania, France, Colombia, Peru, Germany, Turkey, Argentina, and Costa Rica.

My favorite story this quarter was a report about a woman in Florida who works for a Spanish language newspaper. She was turned on to _The Urantia Book_ after reading an article in her newspaper. The article was written by Urantia Book evangelist and Pipeline volunteer Nelida Oliver of Ecuador! This quarter’s placements bring our Pipeline all-time totals to twelve hundred and four books placed into fifty-eight countries around the world. We deeply appreciate your continuing financial help. If you would like to contribute to this work, donations can be made at: www.urantiabook.org/support or by mail to:

Thank you so much for your support!

## Quenching A Thirst, Feeding The Hunger

By _Agustin Arellano and Buck Weimer_

In late May and early June of this year, the International Fellowship Committee mounted an outreach mission to Argentina and Chile. Team members included: Agustin Arellano, Jorge Ortiga (Mexico), Nelida Oliver (Argentina/Ecuador), Dr. Rafael and Nidia Arias Rojas (Costa Rica), Dolores Nice (San Francisco), and Arlene and Buck Weimer (Colorado).

After paying homage to the mausoleum of Evita Peron, and reuniting with old friends, we left Buenos Aires for Cordoba; a university city to the north. From there we bussed it to the mountain community of Capilla del Monte where Nelida, Dolores, and Rafael gave two lengthy interviews on the regional radio station answering questions about El Libro de Urantia. A book was left for the public library.

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/005657.jpg">
</figure>

Outside Capilla del Monte was the wonderful retreat center Onozone where we presented a single night of power-point presentations to 25-30 truth-seekers. They uplifted us, and many stayed long after it was over for discussion, books, handouts, spiritual vitamins, posters, CD’s, and coupons. (Coupons are a system developed by David Kantor to give to individuals in countries where books are not available, or too expensive. A person has merely to fill out the address information on the back and mail it. Michelle Klimesh at the Pipeline of Light receives the coupon and sends that person a book. Carrying ten coupons sure is lighter than carrying a case of books!) 

Returning to Cordoba, we did a lightly attended presentation in a hotel meeting hall where seven people did receive a book and other secondary materials. The main library accepted a donated book. 

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/005658.jpg">
</figure>

Back in Buenos Aires, a one hour radio interview with Agustin and Rafael was conducted by Prof. Maria del Carmen Nadal and broadcast to those of the city’s nearly three million listening inhabitants. The station manager was overjoyed with the number of call-ins received during the period of questions and answers. Nelida Oliver has contracted with this same radio station for an hourly once-per-month discussion about The Urantia Book. (For those understanding Spanish or wanting to learn more, this can be heard online at http://www.750am.com.ar/ , and the program is called: “Luz Propia” “One’s Own Light”. Check the website for times.)

That night was our most productive and remarkable event. Approximately seventy spiritually hungry souls attended the presentations and the period of questions and answers. Afterward we were surrounded by most of the attendees clamoring for books, coupons, posters (the last Jesus Timeline poster was taken off the wall and given away.) description brochures, spiritual vitamins, business cards; anything they could get their hands on relating to la revelación. We called it a “soul feeding frenzy.” What a joy it was to be there! 

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/005659.jpg">
</figure>

One of the persons in attendance was Carlos Rubinsky, the UAI representative in the region. We discussed the reconciliation efforts between the Fellowship and Foundation, shook hands, hugged, and agreed “the war is over”. The next day members of Nelida’s study group and Carlos’s study group met – 18 in all – for the first time. And, as a display of the new unity, we agreed to co-host and share a booth at the Buenos Aires Book Fair, the largest in South America in April and May of 2008.

Five of us continued on to Santiago, Chile, where we gave a series of three presentations in one day, attended by thirty-six questioning and curious souls. Again, this insatiable appetite for something new about Jesus, for a new theology, is a phenomenon to behold. We depleted nearly all of the materials we had carried from the United States. Also while there, Agustin burned sixty-four CD’s, twelve DVD’s, and connected with over forty-five telephone calls. 

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Winter/005660.jpg">
</figure>

Before departing, we had dinner at the home of long-time reader Olga Tartakowsky, along with emerging leaders and others. We discussed methods of unity, growth, and inclusiveness. Security concerns make it very difficult for most Latins to invite strangers, even casual acquaintances, into their homes. Their need for books and secondary materials is always on top of the list. 

Finally, a trip to the beach at Viña del Mar to visit with Joaquín Evan and his study group was very fruitful. A book was placed at the Viña del Mar Public Library, and we were ready to head home. 

We returned home and spent time processing all that happened during such a short but intense period of time; and still cannot comprehend it all. Perhaps we’re not meant to understand it; just revel in the experience. As most readers of _The Urantia Book_ know, something unique, something special, happens during an outreach when a truth-seeker is united with the truth. In Latin America, the fields are plentiful but few are the workers.


## Why Interfaith?

By _Peter Laurence_

Why should students of _The Urantia Book_ be interested or involved in interfaith activity? What does the interfaith movement have to do with fostering the evolution of religion on this planet?

### Truth Claims

The conservative elements of most religious traditions are convinced that their belief systems constitute the “truth.” In many cases this conviction goes so far as to claim possession of “the complete truth.” We know that _The Urantia Book_ is a partial revelation that points to a larger truth it can’t contain or even adequately describe. Recognition that all revelations, including _The Urantia Book_, are only approximations of the truth can help unite religionists in the inspiring search for that larger truth – that larger reality which exists beyond all belief systems. If we propose that _The Urantia Book_ is the truth we become just another competing voice in the clamor of truth claims. Religionists have something to learn from each other. Being able to listen as well as tell is a critical skill.

### The Interfaith Movement

One of the primary activities of the interfaith movement is the multi-faith council, where members of diverse religious traditions share their understandings of spiritual reality. When _The Urantia Book_ takes its place at the table, its contribution to the search for truth becomes visible to the representatives of the world’s religions who share that table. These are the people who are at the forefront of the effort to reach inter-religious harmony on the planet. If inter-religious harmony is a desired outcome of planetary evolution, then we have an opportunity to participate in its emergence through the interfaith movement.

### What Can We Do?

There are two major ways in which members of the community of Urantia Book students can become actively involved:
1. Become increasingly aware of the current status of religion in the world. Read about the various religious traditions and institutions as they exist today. Try to get beyond the stereotypes to better understand the beliefs and attitudes of these traditions. Seek out the variations within traditions to avoid the misconception that every member of a given tradition subscribes to the same set of beliefs. Engage in conversation with people from different religious backgrounds – not to quickly move toward telling them about _The Urantia Book_, but rather to better understand their perspectives.
2. Find ways to participate in and be of service to the interfaith movement. Many communities have interfaith councils of some sort.

### The Future

The interfaith movement is preparing the soil of this world for implantation of the _The Urantia Book_ on a council then that’s ideal, but interfaith councils often limit their membership to the older religious traditions. In that event perhaps there’s a way to be of service in conjunction with local interfaith activities. Make financial contributions or volunteer your time to assist with interfaith activities seeds of deeper religious understanding. It is the goal of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship Interfaith Committee and adjuncts to be a part of that movement. We all believe we can definitely help.

## Join Us In India

By the year 2010, India will be the largest English-speaking population of any country in the world; currently 29% or 350 million Indians speak English. It is the home of the biggest youth population on Urantia, 600 million people under the age of 25. Along with China, India is emerging as one of the strongest and most respected economies in the international market, and is soon expected to be the third largest in the world. Their economic growth rate is clocked at 9.4%, and their growing middle class is already larger than the entire population of the United States.

Therefore, in February, 2008, The Fellowship’s International Fellowship Committee is going to the New Delhi Book Fair on another fantastic outreach adventure. We have secured our booth at the fair; and if you are interested in this unique outreach opportunity, we invite you to join us. The fair dates are February 2-10, 2008.

You can come and volunteer at the booth for one day or the entire time. We are trying to coordinate affordable accommodations, and flights to New Delhi can be expensive, so time is of the essence. If you are interested in joining this outreach adventure, please notify Paula Thompson at Fellowship@UrantiaBook.org as soon as possible.

## An Invitation To Membership

By _Lenny Cowles_, Membership Chair

“A social group of human beings in coordinated working harmony stands for a force far greater than the simple sum of its parts.” <a id="a254_129"></a>[[UB 133:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_6)] We associate with each other in order to share a common purpose the worldwide dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. More simply stated; organized efforts build wonders to behold. 

With each new member we reach a new level of unity of purpose while embracing the diversity of our service. All that the Fellowship has to offer is always offered freely without requiring membership. We do this because it symbolically represents the attitude of the universe; freely we have been offered all that is eternal without reservation.

I joined the Fellowship because I wanted to be part of a greater whole. _The Urantia Book_ opened my eyes and my heart, revealing a whole new epochal way of living. Each of us in our own way joyously embarks in spreading the good news of the Gospel, for that is the mission the Master asks of each of us. We have also learned that, what the world needs most is “to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men.” <a id="a258_485"></a>[[UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1)]

As individuals, we can shine a light, we can inspire, we can and do reveal Jesus’ love and compassion, joy and steadfast devotion. As relates to the work of the individual, one on one, the rewards are self evident. But there is more that you can do and if you perchance lack the gifts of a dedicated apostle, or of a gifted teacher, or those of an inspirational speaker; then there are other ways to make humble efforts become more effective.

“_The spirit of counsel, the social urge, the endowment of species co-operation; the ability of will creatures to harmonize with their fellows; the origin of the gregarious instinct among the more lowly creatures._” <a id="a262_216"></a>[[UB 36:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_10)] Working as a group, in local societies, on task orientated committees, or even nationally within the General Council, takes commitment and dedication. While personal recognition is rarely given, participation is rewarded when you see how work does get accomplished, locally, nationally, and internationally. Membership in the Fellowship entitles you to sincerely accept your part in the accomplishments of the whole. You stepped forward, you raised your hand, you signed on the line and accepted the challenge. You may not have been able to work 24-7-365, but as a member of a team your efforts do work just that long, hard, and effectively.

If you are already a member, let me say thanks. Stay involved, keep up the efforts, know that you are making a difference. If you are not a member, allow me to invite you to get involved and join with us. If you feel that the revelations learned from the pages of _The Urantia Book_ are important, that they brought you closer to God, that they helped you find a way to accept His wondrous gifts, then please share that unconditionally with others. Help us help others to begin, and to continue to explore, their own personal path of Universe Destiny. 

> The group potential is always far in excess of the simple sum of the attributes of the component individuals. <a id="a266_112"></a>[[UB 10:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_2)]
