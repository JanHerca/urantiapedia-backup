## IC’14 Registration Is Here!

It’s time to GROW GODWARD! Plan ahead for _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship’s International Conference in July, 2014. IC’14 brings us to New England where some of Urantia’s great minds envisioned the journey of a new nation. In this historic setting, nestled among rolling hills and colonial homesteads, we will come together to envision our personal and shared journeys toward God. Oh, and have a SUPREMELY good time together!

Join us at the University of Massachusetts – Amherst from Wednesday, July 23rd through Sunday, July 27th, 2014.

Whether you’re a preschooler looking for your first discourse on absonite reality or a baby-boomer wanting to play in the sand like Jesus did, this conference is designed with you in mind. The program is dedicated to celebrating our many paths toward God, and includes both unique study programs and dynamic activities centered on living the teachings, serving with love, exploring family life, practicing values, and cooperating across religions. We have a new and expanded children’s program as well as a phenomenal Truthseekers curriculum for teens—not to mention caving, rafting, hiking, and some massive kickball games.

IC’14 is shaping up to be one of the most creative gatherings to date. The event will feature the premiere of a new musical about Jesus and Ruth, the first-ever UB YouTube film festival, live performances by musicians around the country, award-winning food for every diet, and a few other surprises yet to be announced. To keep yourself up to date on all the latest conference news, visit the website at www.ic14.org and/or like the IC’14 Facebook page.

The conference will be here faster than you can say “Your will be done,” so register now! We are offering $50 off for everyone who signs up before February 1st! We also have family packages, reduced rates for children, and great camping options nearby. This year we’re introducing a special discount code for young adults ages 16-35, so contact chair@ic14.org if that’s you!

We look forward to growing Godward with you in 2014! Lighten life with love, 

The IC’14 Team

## Grow Godward - Propose a Workshop!

Your creativity is at the heart of the IC’14 program. Do you have a vision for a workshop or activity? Now is the time! Submit a proposal at www.ic14.org by January 1, 2014.

In order to celebrate our different approaches to spiritual growth, the program is grouped into six tracks from which participants can mix and match. In your proposal, just identify the track in which your workshop best belongs:

**Study the Book**

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005820.jpg">
</figure>

This track is for in-depth study of _The Urantia Book_. A workshop unpacking the philosophic concept of the I AM in Paper 105 would fit in this track, as would a lesson on UB cosmology under the stars.

Chair, Marilynn Kulieke - study@ic14.org

<br>

<br>

**Bring the Family**

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005821.jpg">
</figure>

This track provides workshops and activities for whole families and new readers. It is focused on family culture and concepts that participants will find valuable whether or not they are familiar with the UB.

Chair, Janet Graham - families@ic14.org

<br>

<br>

**Serve with Love**

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005822.jpg">
</figure>

This track provides inspiration and hands-on opportunities for outreach and service. A public introduction to _The Urantia Book_ or a volunteer outing to a nearby organic farm would fit this track.

Chair, Andrea Barnes - service@ic14.org

<br>

<br>

**Seek Truth**

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005823.jpg">
</figure>

The Truthseekers program has been established as a valuable path for young people to grow in spiritual awareness through meanings and values. Leaders of the Truthseekers program will guide conference participants through the Truthseekers curriculum.

Chair, Tom Choquette - truthseekers@ic14.org

<br>

<br>

**Live the Teachings**

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005824.jpg">
</figure>

This track offers strategies and experiences to help make the teachings manifest. For instance, a middle school teacher could share how she incorporates character development in the classroom and give participants a chance to practice on each other.

Chair, Cristina Seaborn - music@ic14.org

<br>

<br>

**Engage the World**

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2013_Winter/005825.jpg">
</figure>

Many Urantia Book students are engaged in interfaith work and international dialogue. This track could include an interfaith conversation at a local church about growing Godward, as well as a presentation on the growth of the Urantia movement in Brazil.

## We Didn’t Call Them Service Projects

By _Jo Ann Wiedman_

Over 30 years ago a young mother in our Denver study group was suddenly widowed when her husband perished in a fatal car crash. She saw the police at the scene of the accident on her way home from work, praying for the victims as she drove by, not knowing one of them was the father of her children. Wanting to show love and support, our members went to her home on a weekend and painted several rooms. This facilitated her ability to sell the house and move to a safer, friendlier neighborhood.

Recently several of us were discussing the idea of study groups doing service projects. And this lady reminded us of the service we had given her in her time of need and grief. This group act of kindness held true value in her heart.

In my opinion, it’s one of the reasons our study group was a vital part of so many lives for over a decade. We had helped each other with other things too. When Jim Brummett and I moved to an 80-year-old house with our 3-month-old baby, our study group friends made it happen with grace and light hearts.

At a study group meeting in that new home, Archie Anderson asked if we would help build a boardwalk through mountain wilderness so that handicapped people could enjoy a mountain trail. Our members said “Yes!” We camped out with our families and worked for the weekend. Last weekend I drove by Wilderness on Wheels and remembered that project with fondness.

While I lived in Pueblo, one of our study group members was suffering the effects of a traumatic brain injury that changed nearly every aspect of his life. He was not able to read even a paragraph aloud at study group. After suddenly reaching a new level of healing, George was motivated to be of service. A project called Eco-Village inspired him. After helping to create a website for the project, he wanted to get his old band together and have a concert to raise funds and awareness. George found an outdoor venue behind a restaurant. We cleaned the patio, arranged the tables, and set up an admission gate. And on the evening of the event, those of us who were not musicians helped set up the stage, sold tickets, and even bartended. We all enjoyed hearing George sing and play with his band again. Even more, our group became closer and we felt like a TEAM for having worked together on this project.

The Boulder Women’s Corps, a group of Urantia Book readers from several study groups, was created to do service for women and children. I still feel close to these women because we imagined, created, and completed some very meaningful acts of service together.

_The Urantia Book_ states: “One of the most important lessons to be learned during your mortal career is teamwork. The spheres of perfection are manned by those who have mastered this art of working with other beings.” <a id="a246_219"></a>[[UB 28:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_14)] Becoming a service team with your study group may be one of the most valuable things Urantia Book readers can do together.

Jesus sent the apostles out in pairs for a reason. Perhaps sharing the experience adds to the meaning and value. Even if every person in your study group is not inspired to do this kind of thing together, there are likely to be several who will be willing to join you. Personally, I have noticed that service done as a group is somehow more satisfying. All these projects were experienced because one person with a passion came to the group and asked “Will you help?” Maybe you know of a need in your own community that you could bring to your group. Group service can be a great study group experience.

## Quietly Serving in South Korea

By _Barry Clark_

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">

Based on the best available research, the Revelation first appeared in South Korea circa 1970. One Choi, Il, an artist, poet, and multi-published author discovered the [English] Urantia Book at a Seoul Book Store and continues to spend his days quietly promoting its ideas from the outskirts of Seoul. Ello, as he is known to his friends, “still remembers the moment he first opened _The Urantia Book_”. 

Some years later, one Rob Reno, Urantia Book reader and military assignee to South Korea in the mid ‘80s, was known to organize the first-ever Urantia Book study group during his brief assignment there. 

In 1989, a love affair precipitated the first-ever translation of the Revelation into the native language of Korea. And the wonderful struggles about the ‘best’ way to do this ensued when Kwan Choi began another translation circa 1995. These wonderful struggles continue to this day as remarkable people further the translations and dissemination processes in Korea. 

One such man, who has completely dedicated himself to the advancement of the revelation in Korea, through actual service towards the continuing improvement of its translation and dissemination, is Sy Chang.

After discovering the Revelation some fourteen years ago, Sy, an engineer by trade, early involved himself in service to the revelation. Sy looked at the early translations, saw they needed improvement, jumped into this process, and also understood the importance of dissemination. 

In this latter [dissemination] role, Sy understood that it was important to communicate the availability of the Revelation—not only because of its incomparable message, but also because doing so could attract others, other early adopters, who would help improve the translation.

As such, in 2001, Sy decided there was no better place to do outreach, to communicate the availability of the Revelation, and to attract early readers, than at the annual Seoul International Book Fair. Sy knew that hundreds of thousands of mostly young people attend this event every year. “What better place?” Sy reasoned. And so, he committed himself to promoting the revelation at this event and has done so every year since. He does so in humility, and quiet service.

But the nature of Sy’s quiet service, this service to the millions of folks who have attended the Korean Book Fair since 2001 and passed by the booth he so strategically locates each year, is no longer a secret. In fact, at this year’s Book Fair, Ms. Park Geun-hye, the first female President of South Korea, passed by the booth and smiled at Sy.

Moreover, Sy’s dedicated service has attracted the attention of both the Foundation and the Fellowship, and in the ever-increasing spirit of cooperation and collaboration, both organizations are now co-sponsoring Sy’s efforts at this important venue. 

At the present time, based on book sales, downloads, the experience of several internet-savvy bloggers in South Korea, and Sy’s efforts, it is believed there are well over five thousand active Korean readers. 

It is truly amazing what one can do, quietly serving.

## Two Seats Open on the Fellowship General Council

Do you have ideas about how the Fellowship should be developing? Projects which it should be undertaking? If so, you may want to consider running for a seat on the General Council.

It will be up to future General Councilors to help design and implement expanding outreach and reader support services in a rapidly changing environment. Your help is needed. Are you willing to get directly involved? There is an application for organizational service on the website at www.ubfellowship.org/service app.htm.

It is a prerequisite for service as a leader in the Fellowship that the candidate must first be a member of the organization. If you would like to be considered for leadership positions available but are not a member of the Fellowship, it’s not hard to join. Submit your membership application at: www.urantiabook.worldsecuresystems.com/join-us.
