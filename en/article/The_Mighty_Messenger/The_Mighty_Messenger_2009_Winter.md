## Introducing Our New President


<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2009_Winter/Michelle_Klimesh.jpg">
</figure>

Michelle Klimesh has been elected by the General Council to be our new Urantia Book Fellowship president! Her first association with _The Urantia Book_ began in 1973 when still a teenager. Since 1994, she has been the leader of a Urantia Book study group. 

As the owner of a gymnastics school which has thirty-five employees and over twelve hundred students, she had her managerial experience sharpened as well as her innate “knack” for business, finance, mathematics, and organization. She is a former president of the Golden Gate Circle Urantia Society, having been a member since 1994. 

Michelle has served as a former Secretary of the General Council, as chair of the Education Committee, as chair of the Special Projects Committee, and as Secretary General. Her book, The Story of Everything, is a distillation and condensation of the entire Urantia Book. Since 2002 Michelle has functioned as the coordinator of the Pipeline of Light project through which hundreds of Urantia Books have been placed in dozens of countries. 

Four months of prayer preceded her decision to run for president and she writes: “I feel deeply honored to have been elected to serve. During the next three years I hope to more fully implement online dissemination of the revelation, to simplify our operating systems, and to foster a culture of appreciation in our working groups. 

“It is absolutely thrilling to participate in group deliberations in the company of such great minds and humble souls as constitute our current General Council. The newly elected Executive Committee is a fantastic group of workers who seem uniquely suited to the task of bringing the revelation to today’s global community. 

“I anticipate the adventures of my three-year term with joy. Now and always, I ask for prayers for our wisdom, patience, compassion, and clarity as we work together for the uplift of Urantia.”

## General Council Ceremony

By _Cece Forrester_

<figure id="Figure_20" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2009_Winter/005723.jpg">
</figure>

This past summer, Fellowship members and friends gathered for a new celebration instituted to recognize newly elected and outgoing members of the Fellowship General Council, following the triennial elections and prior to the convening of the Council.

During an evening ceremony at Dominican University, site of the 2009 Study Session, new and outgoing Councilors received a commemorative crystal angel paperweight as “a reminder that we have guardian angels who care for us, and that we are the guardians of the task we have accepted,” said ceremony organizer Cristina Seaborn. “Angel givers” personally handed the angel to each incoming and outgoing councilor. The new Council members were asked “Do you pledge to take on this sacred task and perform it to your best ability? “ and each responded “I do.”

The eight outgoing Councilors were recognized for their service, with individuals who know them best sharing heartwarming and humorous stories about each one’s service. The honorees were: Larry Geis, Doreen Heyne, Nancy Johnson, David Kantor, John Lange, Harry McMullan III, Susan Ransbottom and Paul Snider. Those speaking in tribute were David Glass, John Hay, Paula Thompson, Bobbie Dreier, Larry Geis, Michael Challis, Jo Ann Weidman, and Steve Dreier.

To conclude the ceremony, Council members joined hands in a circle around a representation of our planet, and were surrounded by a larger circle of others attending the ceremony to signify their prayers and support. Said Cristina, “The part of the ceremony where we created three concentric circles was a symbol of the general councilors being in charge of bringing this world to a lighter place. The earth was the center circle, councilors the second, and the audience the third circle. This is a powerful image for Urantia Book readers.”

The impetus for the ceremony was the sense some Councilors felt, during preparations for the triennial elections, of a need to mark the significance of the change in General Council membership and set the tone for the Council to serve and support the reader community during the next three years. As Cristina put it, “the sacredness of our task is in cooperation with each other and our celestial helpers. We may not always know the consequence and importance of our work.” Inspired by a ceremony used by the Garden Project, she suggested the idea during preparations for this summer’s Triennial elections, and took on the work of organizing it.

<figure id="Figure_20" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2009_Winter/005724.jpg">
</figure>

Cristina set out to create an event that would incorporate meaningful symbolism without being overly ritualistic. She recruited three Urantia women who were recently ordained through InnerLife International: Aurora Hill, Christilyn Biek Larson, and Meredith Tenney. Francyl Gawryn and Barbara Hester provided music, to help create a sacred space. Other helpers included Jo Ann Weidman, Robert Burns, Paula Thompson, Michael Tanesky, Phil Taylor, Dolores Nice and Charles Olivea. Commented Cristina, “The spiritual power of the ceremony at the beginning was so much more than I had imagined. I believe all our angels were celebrating with us too.”

With a template now in place, Cristina hopes that this will become a new tradition. “Humans love ceremony. There is a memory to reflect on that will encourage you when you get down to doing the real work.” 

## From the Finance Committee

As the days grow short and winter begins to set in, the whole world gets ready to celebrate the birth of Jesus on our world. We who believe _The Urantia Book_ know that in fact and in truth he is our beloved Creator Son, Michael, starting out on his seventh and final bestowal as a babe born in Bethlehem and laid in a manger, while angels sang His praises on high.

Although Christmas seems to have taken on a more commercial feeling these days than a spiritual one, it still carries with it the spirit of giving to and of loving one another. Families put away their daily chores and come together as families once again, and joy and happiness fills the air.

This past year has been a tough one for all of us. Many of our friends have lost their jobs or seen their pensions and savings disappear overnight as we all are tightening our belts to get through these lean times.

We realize that you may not be able to give as generously this year as you have in the past, but be assured, that as the old woman who only had two mites to put in the offering gave more than all the others, any amount you can give this year to help us out would be greatly appreciated.

The best way to give ‘the gift that keeps on giving’ is to sign up for our auto debit program. Just go to our website at www.urantiabook.org and click on ‘contribute’ at the top of the page and follow the instructions to sign up for the auto debit program. Or you can send us your donation in the enclosed return envelope.

Meanwhile, here at the Fellowship, with over 1000 members worldwide, our twelve standing and ad hoc committees of volunteers are busy at work:
- Reaching out to new readers and religious leaders, and distributing Urantia Books through 1000 bookstores and over the internet. We will distribute over 3000 Urantia Books in 2009.
- We have built and are continually improving a very good website (www.Urantiabook.org) which reached over four million unique visitors this past year. You can download the book in seven different languages from this site; and you can listen to and download any paper or the entire book in audio from this website. This past year over 235,000 people downloaded at least one Paper to listen to.
- Our International Fellowship Committee (IFC) has outreach programs going next year in India, Africa, Korea, and throughout Latin America, and IFC actually sends representatives to these countries to encourage and spiritually support the readers there.
- Our Publications Committee publishes the Mighty Messenger and the Herald and sends them out to over 10,000 readers annually. Our past President, Robert Burns, is also sending out e-News letters to our 4000 member email list every month.
- Our Education Committee is expanding its efforts to train new teachers while continuing to hold its annual 3-day Study Sessions each summer. We had over 100 attendees this past summer in Chicago.

These are but some of the efforts that the Fellowship has embarked upon to further its mission of cultivating the spirit of religion by spreading _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. 

The good ship, Urantia, has moved out of her safe harbor, out onto the open seas of her future destiny.

Welcome aboard.

John Hay – Chair: Finance Committee

## “God-Consciousness: A Living University” Inspires In-depth Study

By _Barbara Newsom_ and _Charles Olivea_

”Beautiful! Beautiful!” “The workshops were great! The participants were supportive and enthusiastic. Great topic.” “I see growth in the people—in the community—and it shows in the depth of the program.” “A lifetransforming experience.”

These responses describe the soul-satisfying experiences of participants in the Summer Study Session at Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois, July 31-August 2. Have you ever noticed _The Urantia Book_ places definitions of God-consciousness in the last sentence of the Foreword and the first sentence of the last paragraph of the whole book? With these inspiring words, 116 participants from Canada, Germany, and the United States were invited to join in a study and celebration of the teachings in the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

Sponsored by the Education Committee of the Fellowship, in-depth study sessions have been held regularly since 1963. This year the three-day program featured principal themes of God-Consciousness each day: God the Father, our Brothers and Sisters, and our Master Son, Michael. A site on campus served as a Temple of the Father’s invisible presence, inspired by the example of the Garden of Eden, where participants gathered for morning and evening meditation. The Education Committee of the Fellowship believes strongly that a formal place set aside at every conference for the worshipful recognition of our Father helps to anchor the individual/collective consciousness of the divine presence. “The centering silence was a great asset in balancing head and heart,” said one participant. 

Following a morning plenary session with music, worship and a presentation in the auditorium, two-hour workshops in the morning and afternoon explored the topics intensively. Twenty faculty members presented a farreaching program. Fellowship President Robert Burns opened and closed the program. Education Committee members Lila Dogim and Barbara Newsom co-chaired the event, managing arrangements and program, respectively, with Gary Deinstadt, outgoing Education Committee chair. Fellowship director Paula Thompson coordinated registration assisted by her daughter Mae. Cristina Seaborn coordinated music and worship.

An extensive bookstore was staffed by Mike Wood, Urantia Foundation; Mark Kulieke and Pat Hilger, Morning Star Foundation, and Paula Thompson, Urantia Book Fellowship. “Evangels of Revelation” met daily to develop their public speaking skills with Education Committee member and speech coach Nick Stefero. Nick also coordinated our feedback sessions at the end of each day during which students, not faculty, gave short talks on their respective workshops. Mark Erickson provided audio recordings of presentations and workshops. Study materials are being added to the committee’s website www.urantia-education.org:
- **Friday, July 31**: Plenary, Charles Olivea, God the Father. Workshops: Paper 5, God’s Relation to the Individual, Benet Rutenberg; God-Consciousness and the Purpose of _The Urantia Book_, David Kulieke; Evolutionary “Inevitabilities” in Growing a God-Consciousness, Tony Finstad; God-Consciousness in Everyday Living, Barbara Newsom; Race and the Consciousness of God, Charles Olivea and Katharina Becker; Resting in the Arms of God, Andre Traversa; The Word of God: Seven Sentences-Seven Words, Robert Moyers; A Liberating Partnership, Vicki Arkens.
- **Saturday, August 1**: Plenary, Barbara Newsom, God-Consciousness: Our Brothers and Sisters. Workshops: Urantia-University and The Windows of Sleep, David Nash; Taking the Path to God-Consciousness: Supremacy, Ultimacy, Absoluteness, Infinity, David Glass; Where in the Universe are We? John Causland; repeat of the Race workshop; Some Universe Romancing: God-Consciousness in Art, Architecture, and Literature of the Last Andites, David Kantor; Can the Brotherhood of the Kingdom Really Transform Society? Jo Ann Wiedman; Revving Up the Revelation, Thomas Orjala; Power of Unconditional Love, Robert Moyers. 
- **Sunday, August 2**: Plenary, Phil Taylor, Our Master Son, Michael. Workshops: The Religious Life of Jesus, Lila Dogim; Spiritual Practices for Deepening our Relationship with God, Chris Hyde; Learning to Love Others, or, How to Love our Enemies, Christilyn Biek Larson; Powerful Peaceful Thinking: How to Know Jesus Christ as Savior, Lord, Master, Friend, and King, Robert Moyers.

Lila Dogim coordinated fellowship each evening. Music and worship were coordinated by Cristina Seaborn and provided by Kurt Cira, Francyl and Marvin Gawryn, Barbara Hester, and James Woodward. A pre-conference day on Thursday included an Education Workshop on the future of education in our community, led by Charles Olivea and Katharina Becker; “Art in Chicago,” a tour of some of Chicago’s great art and architecture, led by Marilynn Kulieke, and a Spiritual Retreat, led by Bobbie Dreier.

All workshop leaders expected participants to bring their Urantia Books to the sessions. Several workshop leaders conducted pre-conference study with their study groups and societies; they are also continuing the 2009 theme of study with post-conference study in their local areas. Some of the workshop leaders posted recommended reading prior to the conference. One workshop required pre-registration, with required reading assignments. All of these features were well-received, as evidenced from written feedback and evaluations submitted by participants. Participants’ suggestions for improvement are being incorporated into the 2010 summer study session.

The Education Committee is strongly committed to deepening and broadening the nature of study among students of the revelation, having noted that “voluntary study” becomes a norm by the Fifth Mansion World for the majority of ascenders. Study of the revelation is a complement to “unselfish service” and “spontaneous worship,” also commonplace on the Fifth Mansion World [[UB 47:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_5)]. To what extent can we actualize these potentials now? As one participant enthusiastically said, “I do feel more real!”

## God-Consciousness & Cosmic Morality: Living the Gospel 

### Summer Study Seminar, July 21-July 26, 2010

> _The temporal relation of man to the Supreme is the foundation for cosmic morality, the universal sensitivity to, and acceptance of duty. This is a morality which transcends the temporal sense of relative right and wrong; it is a morality directly predicated on the self-conscious creature’s appreciation of experiential obligation to experiential Deity._ [Paper 117:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p4_8)

Please join us in a study of the way cosmic morality is shaped by the quality of how we live the gospel; for us, living the revelatory teachings of _The Urantia Book_. The Education Committee of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship invites you to consider opportunities to teach and serve, possibly as a plenary speaker, workshop/seminar facilitator, pre-conference activities, entertainment, etc. For pre-registration for a special seminar at the conference, see the following article.

Techny Towers is a conference and retreat center located on Chicago’s North Shore. It is designed for people who want to study, worship, and enjoy each other in fellowship. Techny Towers has become a landmark; historically as an early 20th century seminary for the Society of the Divine Word; today, as an ecumenical center fostering creativity and strategic thinking. The Education Committee spent a weekend there in October of 2009 and thinks it will be a good location for the Fellowship’s Conference. The grounds were lovely and peaceful, and the sleeping accommodations and food were both very good. We encourage you to visit their website www.Technytowers.org. 

To volunteer for service please contact Lara Amyx at 772-466-7950 or lara10@bellsouth.net

## A Life of Service

<figure id="Figure_21" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2009_Winter/Lynda_DArcangelo.jpg">
</figure>

Lynda D’Arcangelo, an invaluable member of the Publications Committee, began her transition to the mansion worlds on October 21st. A long-time reader, Lynda joined the committee in 2001. Due to her past experience in publishing, she immediately became our expert and final word on the quality of language usage in our publications, particularly the Fellowship Herald. It was typical of her generous and loving personality that she especially enjoyed working with new authors, helping them to gain confidence in their writing. 

She began her career in social work, and throughout her life continued to volunteer her time and effort in loving service to her family, friends, and the Urantia revelation. Lynda was very active in the Urantia Society of Greater New York, serving several terms as an officer. 

Those of us who worked with and loved her consider it a privilege to have known her. We will miss her.

## Pipeline Of Light Report

Since my last report, Pipeline of Light volunteers have placed copies of _The Urantia Book_ into eleven countries. Your donations to the Pipeline helped us deliver books to readers and study groups in Costa Rica, India, England, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and Ecuador.

In addition, we placed books in three new countries this quarter! We sent a Spanish translation to Honduras, a French book to Cameroon, and an English book to Botswana. Book totals by language this quarter included three Russian, forty-six Spanish, seven English, and one French translation.

This quarter’s placements bring our Pipeline all-time totals to 2,412 books placed into sixty-six countries around the world.

We deeply appreciate your continuing financial help. If you would like to contribute to this work, donations can be made online at www.urantiabook.org/support or by mail to _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, PO Box 6631, Broomfield, CO 80021.

## Fellowship International Activities

**South Korea**: The Seoul International Book Fair 2009, May 13-17, was held in a downtown conference center with over 211 booths represented by authors, printers, and distributors. Local reader Sy Young Chang was responsible for organizing, planning, and setting up the booth, and was assisted by Barry Clark of _The Urantia Book_ Society of Greater New York, and International Committee Chair, Buck Weimer. 

From the beginning, the booth was planned and designed as a joint effort between the Fellowship and the Foundation because of the two different translations of _The Urantia Book_ in the Korean language, and expressed our desire for a united effort in presenting the book not only to the Korean people, but to the many international visitors attending the book fair. 

The five days of the fair were filled with activities: a public presentation at the Fair, a short interview on Korean television, the printing and distribution of “spiritual vitamins” in Korean as well as English and many pamphlets and brochures, and a visit to a local study group. This experience reinforced the opinion of the Urantian participants that South Korea is now, and will become, the major launching pad for the Revelation in Asia–even if it is one sentence at a time. 

**Mexico**: The 9th National Congress of readers of El Libro de Urantia was held in Monterrey, Mexico, April 12- 14 and was organized by Agustin Arellano and the El Grupo Orvonton Society of Mexico City. The conference on “Celebrating Life” formally opened with a presentation by Ricardo G. Van Dyck, of Mexico City, the new president of El Grupo Orvonton, and was followed by a power point presentation by Nelida Oliver (Ecuador). 

Additional delightful presentations were made over the next two days by Dr. Elyr Silva of Brazil, Dr. Rafael Fco. Arias of Costa Rica, Griselda Cantu of Monterrey, and Lourdes Salazar (Mexico). A mandala video by Jorge Ortega (Mexico) had participants sporting chroma depth high definition glasses. Dolores Nice and Buck Weimer of the Fellowship’s International Committee also made presentations, as well as Alfonso Garcia. The conference concluded with a brainstorming session on how to best further the Revelation in Latin America. 

**Costa Rica**: The first bilingual conference in Costa Rica was held June 16-20 in Puntarenas, Costa Rica. As the first of its kind, it drew readers from as far away as Alaska (Ed Harrigan) and as far south as Ecuador (Nelida Oliver) as the Costa Rican community took the lead. The different presentations at the conference took various forms: dancing to Latin music, slide shows of great words, beauty, and uplifting music, and some workshops that facilitated deep thought processes. 

This conference laid the groundwork for future multilingual events outside the United States. Four of the six members of the International Committee (Dolores Nice, Charlene Morrow, Cristina Seaborn, and Chair, Buck Weimer) were present, with a total of 33 people attending. Many thanks to Agustin Arellano, who did a yeoman’s job with translating and allowing a better way for translation to emerge. And many thanks for all the efforts of the Spanish-English speaking reader community for their help in making this conference a memorable experience.
