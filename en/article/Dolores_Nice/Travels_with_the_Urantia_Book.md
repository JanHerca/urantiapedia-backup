During the twenty plus years I have served on the International Committee of the Fellowship, I have had the opportunity and privilege to travel with my co-workers to different countries to work on book fairs and gatherings regarding the Urantia Book. Most of my work has been in Latin America, but I also went to Korea, the Philippines, and Turkey. In Latin America, I went to Costa Rica, Mexico, Ecuador (numerous times), Argentina, Guatemala, and Colombia. I was not able to go to Cuba because of travel restrictions for Americans, but I was able to partner with the readers from Mexico who went with Urantia related materials and supplies.

Besides book fairs and gatherings, we have participated in radio and television programs with people calling in with comments and questions. We also held classes on how to

conduct a study group, secondary works, and leadership roles. One of the most interesting experiences was the road trip to four cities in Ecuador. We rented a mini bus and went to Quito, Guayaquil, Ambato, and Ibarra. What an adventure adjusting to the roads in the Andes Mountains, and trying to breath at high altitudes!

In Ibarra we had rented a meeting hall to give our presentations. We were surprised to see a full house and afterwards many came forward to talk with us. I especially remember two young men who had so many questions and proudly showed me the wellworn pages they had copied from the Urantia Book.

I had a small suitcase full of Urantia Books with me, so I asked if they would like to have one. They were thrilled! Books were very expensive. It gave me such joy to give them this gift. On our last night, Ecuador said good-by with an earthquake. My roommate Susan Ransbottom from Colorado was quite shaken, but being from California I took it in stride. It only felt like a 4.5! 

In Argentina, we stopped at a town called Capilla del Monte. We found out that it was well known for extraterrestrial activity, which explained the displays of spaceships and ETs around town! We had a good attendance at our gathering. We did a radio show and had many callers with questions and comments.

At one of the airports, I was questioned at customs about the plastic bags full of spiritual vitamins I had in my suitcase. They thought I was bringing in drugs! The spiritual vitamins are short quotes from the Urantia Book and were very popular and good conversation starters. In Manila one of the hotel maids chased me down the hall because she thought I had forgotten my suitcase. It was the one I had used to carry the Urantia Books. I told her she could keep it and she was surprised but pleased.

A scary experience was in Istanbul, Turkey. Charlene Morrow and I were in a cab returning to our hotel. We were on a busy highway and the driver refused to continue to the hotel because of a long line of cars. We had to walk on the side of the road for about three blocks. I made a police report when we got back to the hotel!

These travels have given me the opportunity to meet many readers and the ability to introduce the Urantia Book to new truth seekers. I feel very grateful and humbled to have been able to be part of this important service and to be a member of a team of workers for the Revelation.
