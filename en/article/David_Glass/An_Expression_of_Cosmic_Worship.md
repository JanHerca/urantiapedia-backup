<p style="text-align:center;">
Oh, Father of all the inhabited worlds, 
true Godhead of galaxies, star-drifts, and suns, 
we adore your Enormity. Stupendous whirls 
of great nebular arms and vast space-sweeping runs 
of subliminal energies infinitesimal, 
ranging the star-fields, are shining on earths 
far remote from our world, which is experimental 
and finding its place in your cosmos; new births 
of galactic star-clouds taking form in the ethers, 
encircling the cosmic domain’s shining brilliance, 
awaken great wonder in all God-believers 
who take in the vastness and utter resilience 
of all the wide, fanciful, cosmic parameters, 
lit by a myriad space-borne light-emitters. 

Radiant glories untold from your heartbeats 
are pulsing throughout all the circuits and lanes 
of the starry dimensions in regular repeats 
of outward-gushed energiesósovereign reigns 
of Omnipotent Power upholding each atom 
and every ultimaton throughout the regions. 
Life permeates all the series of atomic, 
vivified life -forms, now numbering legions, 
and all the assemblage of God-produced creatures, 
observant and growing bright Children of Light, 
sing their anthems of homage to you, whose vast features 
are beamed from your Prior, Pre-manifest Brightness 
of Absolute Oneness, turned Ceaseless Endeavor, 
unending expansion for your and our pleasure.

Since he discovered the book in 1972, David Glass’ poems and articles inspired by the revelation have appeared in many Urantia movement publications. After two years in the Portland, OR area, David recently relocated back to Dallas-Ft.Worth.
