Why should E.T. be the only one to phone home across the light-years of the universe? We would probably be staggered by the amount of his phone bill. E.T.'s advanced technical knowledge enabled him to construct a cosmic telephone out of the odds and ends he found around his host's house. That requires quite a bit of ingenuity, but fortunately, we do not have to have the advanced capability to construct such an interplanetary communications system. If we ever try to communicate cosmically, we discover to our delight that to call the Designer of the entire universe conversational apparatus, the phone we need is already installed and ready for use. There is no installation charge, no need for repair with normal use, and no activation fee. Even the expense of the receiver and sender is abrogated by the prior preparation of the Master Communications Executive. Just as we discovered that we have the vocal apparatus to converse with as a child, so is it revealed to us that a far more intricate and critically designed cosmic phone system is already at our disposal.

Just as a caring and loving parent is delighted to receive a phone call from a son or daughter whom they have not heard from recently, so does the Phone designer likewise eagerly await our calls. When we see the flashing red light on our mechanical phone answering machine, we pick up the receiver and discover that the Phone Fashioner has already left a message of love and truth to start off our use of the cosmic phone. The Fashioner has left his number and the area code of astronomic region of his phone which is used on the initial phone home experience. It seems to be up to the client as to whether he will return a response to the message recorded on his call-receiving machine. After the phoner chooses to answer the call, utilizing the priorly prepared phone system, it is no longer necessary to employ either the phone number nor area code. Thereafter, the phoner needs only pick up the receiver and the Designer is already on the line waiting to receive his calls.

These phones are now available in a cordless style which affords the phoner the liberty to walk or even travel about taking the phone mechanics with him. Once the system is grounded in the receiving unit at the phoner's home, the remote cosmic phone can be employed at any place and at any time. The Designer has a little-understood immeasurable personal fortitude and does not require sleep to continue his 24-hour-a-day availability. Mysteriously, the Designer is able to work all the shifts of the phone company.

As we remarked above, the Designer has made an ample allotment of energy to keep the phone system going and he insists on our calling collect, which is a great relief, seeing that we could hardly afford very many such ExtraLong-Distant phone calls. Since the Designer is always already on the line waiting to be called, it is as though there is no “extra-long-distance” to be overcome whatsoever. In a scientifically inexplicable way, our individual receivers are instantaneously in touch with the Designer, and as use becomes a frequent activity, it is just as though the Designer's Being were in the receiver itself.

One advantage of the cosmic phone system is that it provides a way for us to get the Designer's. viewpoint on the evolving and improving communications systems throughout the universe. While there. are many crews still working in the open field with more and more communicators signing up every day, there remains a lot to be mastered in the intra-universe, client-to-client communications. However, there are “clearing house” activities available which can be dispatched through our receivers which will be referred to the appropriate party. Once a client signs up for a portable model, the incompletion of the whole of the cosmic communications network ceases to be an impediment. Likewise can receivers get in touch with other receivers, but that technology is so advanced that we really have no complete operations manual to explain its functions.

The receiver cones with a built in device which makes it possible for it to function with the wisdom of the Designer and work in the association of the universe of phone subscribers who have “Independent Receiver Activities”. IRA's are able to place calls with other parties and to store valuable information which it can later pass on to its client when he has improved his phone-call-comprehension capacity sufficiently to understand these messages from on high.

On earth we can transcend the immediate situations of life by talking with the Designer over our portable phone modules, someone who has real knowledge about reality and unconditional know-how concerning all the networking desires of all clients. Getting the glimpse that the Designer can get to us without over-powering the circuit breaker and causing faulty transmission, affords us something of his perspective on the entire network. He is able to respond to any functional or personal need of any client. What a resource connection!

The Designer has an unlimited capacity to have new phone lines opening all the time. Incomprehensibly, he can talk with us with what we would call “total attention and solicitous listening” even though he is also connected with a wide array of other phone clients in all universe phone localities.

When there are occasional storms in various regions, some of the power line and communications lines may be temporarily severed, but there are already every possible back-up communications systems which operate while the repair is going on in the storm areas.

The Cosmic Phone Designer is immeasurably superior to our Urantia experts of interpersonal communications devices, even including the Icarus-like communications devices orbitting Urantia and relaying communications. All such devices, however, do have a finite life-expectation and will eventually experience the wax being melted as the sky soaring device returns to plunge into a planetary ocean.

Among the superior factors of the Cosmic Phone System are: One never places a call and receives a busy signal, nor the delay of a message-taking contrivance. There are always more operators than are necessary to respond to or forward our calls to the Designer and his Phone Staff. We will, therefore, never be put “on hold”.

While we will never receive a phone bill, the Designer would appreciate it sometime if we would share his special 800 toll-free number with any of our associates or acquaintances who are oblivious to the Cosmic Phone Network. The Designer has such a transcendental communications ideal he is seeking to realize that it is highly important that every possible receiver should be activated in all potential clients.

When there are confusions on Urantia, picking up the phone to the Designer is a sure way to receive a message of comfort and conciliation with a reminder that there were some phone vandals in our area code the effects of which have not all been yet eradicated.

If we have no special message to relay, the Cosmic Caller always is delighted to send us messages as well. His favorite message is that all is going well for each client and the technological progress of the entire phone system. Actually, all clients are already having their communications improved upon and attunement to the “Designer in the Receiver” makes direct non-circuit-transmitted communications with the Celestial Caller possible.

There is speculation as to whether the Designer's communications system shall so improve as to make it possible for a planet-wide phone-a-thon, in which subscribers to the Cosmic Phone System will call every subscriber in the Designer's phone book so that all planetary individuals will be contacted with and inspired by the discovery of a worldwide, person-to-person relationship which can be had when phone subscriptions become virtually universal.

The free use of one's receiver is unqualified. All phone calls are voluntary, and can be limitlessly beneficial. The Designer installs potential phones in every client, but he doesn't use them to dictate instructions to clients. Those who subscribe to the Phone Company do so for the delight and incomparable improvement which such calls make possible.But it must remain possible for a potential client to have his own phone disconnected. However, withdrawal from the Celestial Phone Circuits which renders impaired and sometimes negated communications possibilities, with the Designer a new problem, also disconnects one's communications with other clients. When this happens, special agents call the 911 numbers and every effort is made to convey the advantages of network membership, and sometimes this is successful and inclusion in the universal phone ship is restored.

The Designer is fully capable of setting up unlimited conference-calling with enormous numbers of his phone staff. It is through such group communications as these that the overall system of phone ship continues to improve, grow, and acquire new features. The Designer does actually confer co-designer ship with his clients and is open for their creative suggestions as to how the overall network can be improved. Crucial in the functioning of the phone-domain is the individual attention which must be rendered to every potential subscriber, and this keeps in creative readiness a tremendous Staff which can even include phone clients themselves. It seems that some of the best messages that will ever come through await the improvement of the communications consolidarity which, it is speculated, is one of the Designer's original intents and goals for the entire phone ship. Obviously, all forms of sound communications can be introduced into the overall phone systems, and a musical piece is sometimes aired over the network through which the celestial choruses can sing, 'The Sweetest Sounds I'11 Ever Hear Are Waiting To Be Heard", one of the favorite cosmic tunes.

Head sets can be Adjusted so that one can remain attuned to the cosmic broadcasts of the communications systems, but these head sets fit over only one ear, and subscribers learn to function with receivership of celestial and planetary information. The improvement in function is marked and this motivates some subscribers to encourage their associates to have their own headsets Adjusted. Adjusted head-sets can also be used, walky-talky fashion, to communicate with other subscribers in relatively short-range transmission and reception. This capacity of the transmitters and receivers can become so “modernized” as to make intra-short-distance dialing. As this increases the overall phone ship capacity of the individual, the Designer has sent to such a communicator the phone books of neighbouring cosmic areas on microfilm. because a printed-out phonebook would be so heavy that a client would be unable to move it, nor even turn its tremendous pages.

The phone ship is currently having this micro-film technology replaced by voice operated service systems which can provide directory assistance upon vocal command by any client.

The phone-function is continuously improving and now even the evidence and record of malfunctions owing to local cosmic disruptions in the communications network are being positively utilized in the actualization of an ever-more-effective universe network of near-instantaneous communications capabilities.

All appreciation and hamage for the supreme effectiveness of the assembling cosmic phone system can be forwarded to the First and Central Caller of All Universal Sectors of Telephonics.

Send not to know for wham the phone rings ...

it rings for us!
