<p style="text-align:center;">
We all shall know the harmony of spirit <br>
attuning us to inner unity<br>
a demonstration of our kindred spirit <br>
as children of the same One Deity <br>
The many variations that divide us <br>
shall be eclipsed by universal love <br>
the inner spirit's guidance shall unite us <br>
in oneness on the earth and then above<br>
As rays projected out from One Bright Center<br>
retracted to divinity shall we<br>
be drawn unto the Universal Center<br>
the Focus of Eternal Harmony<br>
The primacy of spirit gives us kinship<br>
a universal family of friendship
