Our life's a gift with God's own guarantee 
That all its many blessings shall not cease.
The life that throbs in human forms we see 
Shall go with us; our forms here rest in peace. 
One's soul is like a lightweight ping-pong sphere
One far immersed beneath the ocean's deep.
But once released, it swims up to be near
The sunlit brilliance of the sky, to sleep
No more, by dark and drifting shadows kept
From finding the blue sky's resplendent gold.
No need is there to have the shadows swept,
Because no soul will linger there once told
Of all the liberty that lives in skies
Where souls find universal family ties.
