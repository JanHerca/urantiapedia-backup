How often in reflection I advise
Myself: “Your Father God did make the skies”
His velvet black he flung across the heavens
And organized the universe by sevens.

The many types of being blessed with life 
Throughout extensions seeming without end 
Are cosmic citizens, reducing strife, 
Discovering each person is a friend.

Throughout the asst dark kingdoms of the skies 
The never ceasing pulse of perfect power 
Sustains the universe, though no one spies 
The Maker in creation who, each hour,

Renews the cosmos Spirit, love, and energy. 
Are sweeping through the far-flung firmament, 
Establishing new living entities, 
Intending to make clear and eminent

The many jewels of wisdom's timelessness 
Which wo increasingly can understand, 
True gens of thoughts revealed from spacelessness 
From God's infinity beyond what stands.

For more remains forever in God's mind 
To learn, to do, to give to be, to share
Than we shall ever ultimately find
While always are we in our Father's care.

So let us live with boldness and conviction, 
Remembering, each moment, God-within, 
While seeking to discover God's intentions, 
Our Boundless father and Eternal Friend.

For many are the joys of endless service, 
As pre existence breaks above the surface 
Of all that shoreless sea of what could be 
Throughout the Father's vast Infinity.
