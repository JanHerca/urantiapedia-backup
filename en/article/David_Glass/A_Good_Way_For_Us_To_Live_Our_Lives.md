One law the Master shared with all of us; 
One precept which surpasses every thought; 
He taught that men in timeless Brotherhood 
Are sons of one true Father. Truth has sought  

To be the Center of our outward Love; 
The Truth of Living Sonship with one’s God; 
The global and the universal Truth 
That gives us heav’nly glory. We have trod  

Upon this planet several years and seen 
Its ghastly ironies and untold sorrow; 
But we do know that should we now proclaim 
God’s timeless Truths, there will come a tomorrow  

In which the conflicts of our present globe 
Shall be refashioned in a better light 
In which the Father’s bidding will be done 
And Truth will spread her radiant beams of Light.  

We have an opportunity to Serve: 
Proclaiming Jesus’ Truth and sharing Love 
That all may be in-gathered to his Heart 
And life below resemble life above.
