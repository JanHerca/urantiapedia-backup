Dear Friends, I have written a poem inspired by a brief and famous verse by the celebrated English Victorian poet, Robert Browning, “Pippa Passes.” The poem I have written takes Browning's as its base, from which I have composed a poem of my own. My poem is intended to express the idea that, no matter on what universe level we may find ourselves, whether on earth or upon some higher sphere—we shall always maintain an awareness of the reality of the personality relationships and group identities we established here on earth. True and real relationships we form and develop here—whether as friends or fellows, in families or teamwork groups—will continue to relate us, each to each and all together, as we continue to pursue God’s plan, to better comprehend it, and thereby further cultivate the fellowship we formed on Earth. 

Our unity of purpose, our voluntary teamwork, continues ever afterward to vitalize our relationships on ever-heightening levels. Personality relationships, as we know, are an end in themselves. As such they are among the tiny number of revealed realities that can be distinguished in that way. Like the personalities themselves of which they are composed, personality relationships maintain a constant value. They are possessed of a unique and unaltering reality, an enduring and final survival value, that never can or ever shall be diminished or destroyed to any degree. Personality relationships as unique universe realities will only be rendered more profound, more enriched, and more meaningful by the numberless, expanding and diversifying experiences that lie ahead throughout our lengthy and intriguing universe journeys. 

All of us are one in love, unified by one purpose, and united in one destiny, forever to pursue and to realize our Creator’s never- ending plan of universe expansion. We are one family who together make real the fullness of our Father’s dreams. 

## Song for Papa’s Family 

by David Glass 

The year is at autumn, arriving so soon, 
The morning’s at seven and climbing toward noon, 
The lark has ascended, she sails through the sky, 
The snail’s on the thorn, though he’s looking on high. 
God's in Havona, but dwells in us too, 
Singing a love song to each one of you. 
Spirit, advancing through all cosmic space, 
Transmits our love to our friends in their place. 
Whether in heaven or Earth we may seek 
To do God’s will, there the Spirit will speak, 
Saying to each of us: “This is the way. 
Let no misgivings come near you today. 
Whether or not your friends walk by your side, 
Walk in My light, let My love be your guide.” 
We know the truth that expands every day 
Leading us all to that new brighter day 
We seek by our service to manifest here 
At one with our friends on higher new spheres. 
Knowing our labors with theirs are entwined 
We sense how deeply our wills are aligned, 
Bridging the gap that seems otherwise strong 
When all sing together God’s “uni-verse” song, 
That “one-song” of love and of spirit divine 
That unites our service as upward we climb. 
We have assurances, here and above: 
Nothing is greater or stronger than Love. 
It links each level of heaven and earth, 
Bringing from losses a sense of rebirth: 
We honor One Spirit and serve but One Son. 
Whatever our station, our efforts are one. 
Our voices in unison sing out our praise 
With hope for the future to last all our days. 
Our service is cosmic wherever we strive. 
That oneness of spirit unites all our lives 
To do all the biddings of Light and of Love 
Till God's reign on Earth is like that above.
