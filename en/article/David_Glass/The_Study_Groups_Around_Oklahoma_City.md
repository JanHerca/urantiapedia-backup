_Reported by David Glass, Fort Worth, Texas_

> “_Then Jesus spoke, saying: ‘Now that you are ambassadors of my Father's kingdom, you have become a class of men separate and distinct from all other men on earth. You are not now as men among men but as the enlightened citizens of another and heavenly country among the ignorant creatures of this dark world. It is not enough that you live as you were before this hour, but henceforth must you live as those who have tasted the glories of a better life and have been sent back to earth as ambassadors of the sovereign of that new and better world’._” <a id="a38_554"></a>[UB 140:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_1)

## The First Society Of Oklahoma

The First Society of Oklahoma has grown into what is today the largest society of readers in the world with a current enrollment of 186 members. A chronicle of the development of this society is an intriguing tale of leadership, teamwork, initiative, and creativity. One of the inspiring features is that it grew out of a single study group.

The story begins in the year of the publication of _The Urantia Book_, 1955, when a small group of readers came into being. This early group was visited by William Sadler, Jr. and Marian Rowley from Chicago. It grew rapidly and in 1957 was chartered as The First Urantia Society of Oklahoma. Among the 26 founding and charter members were: Berkeley Elliott, Faye Brown, Van and Helen Butler, Mary Kathryn and Bill Grisso (the first president of the society), Mary Lou and Bill Hales, Bob and Ruth Burton, Clyde and Frankie Goodman, and B.M. Salyer, Jr. The current officers of the society are: Tom Allen, President; Jeralie Scanlan, Vice President; Charlene Morrow, Secretary; Mike Challis, Treasurer; and Susan Cook, Historian.

The Oklahoma Society was the fourth chartered society of the Urantia Brotherhood and it was the first to grow from its own instigation and roots without inheriting readers from a preexistent group such as the Forum or another society.

The Oklahoma readership first became visible when it hosted the celebrated 1976 International Conference at the Fountain-head Lodge in Eufaula, Oklahoma, the second International Conference. The very scope of this conference made it remarkable. The previous International Conference (in 1973) had attracted 175 readers, the largest gathering of Urantia Book readers ever to take place up to that time. The International Conference in Eufaula, Oklahoma, however, attracted no less than 435 readers assembled from near and far.

The theme of this conference was, “Matter, Mind, and Spirit — Past, Present, and Future.” Two multi-media presentations were prepared by readers from California: “Matter, Mind, Metamorphosis,” by David and Sue Kantor and friends, tracing the evolution of biological life on Urantia, and another, by Larry Geis, Stephen Zendt, and friends which was a far-ranging survey of Urantia's stormy history and the fate of our first four epochal revelations.

The Oklahomans held another (regional) conference in 1977 for which they created a multi-media presentation on the Life and Teachings of Jesus. Berkeley discovered Larry Mullins' gift for poetic prose and he and several other artists began work on what turned out to be a masterpiece: “Jesus — God and Man”, a three hour detailed account of the life, teachings, death, resurrection and current status of Michael of Nebadon-Jesus of Nazareth. This presentation was the product of the combined work of a writer (Larry Mullins), a composer (Sandy Garrick), and other musicians, photographers, and visual artists, as well as assemblers and coordinators of the work: Tom Allen and Berkeley Elliott, and many other members of the Society who somehow organized their efforts from distant points of North America. “Jesus — God and Man”, along with other multi-media productions are now available for rental directly from the Oklahoma Society or from the Brotherhood of Man Library. The text, “Jesus — God and Man”, beautifully and profusely illustrated, is available in book form from the Oklahoma Society for $ 10.50. Write Berkeley Elliott, 14 SW 97th Street, Oklahoma City, OK 73139.

The Oklahoma group is richly endowed with musically talented readers who have been _responsive_, producing music specifically for the various conferences; and _prolific_, having produced an impressive repertoire of compositions. Instrumental and vocal music written specifically for forum or regional conferences are: “Forward with the Foreword”, “Behold the Man!”, “Who Do You Say That I Am?”, and several other titles. Among their other works is a complete musical presented at the Snowmass International Conference, “The Power From Within”, written and composed by Susan Wright. A highly successful group of Oklahoma musicians, named “Mota”, have produced such record albums and tapes as: “Kindred Spirits”, “Music from Beyond the Brain”, a collection entitled, “Songs for Peace”, “Under the Influence”, and others.

## The Children's Hour

Like some other readers' groups, the Oklahoma Society has a program for children. It convenes each third Saturday at the home of one or more of the children whose parent (or parents) serve as host while another parent (or pair of parents) lead the children in activities of their selection. Sometimes a song or prayer opens the activities. The prepared class immediately follows and consists of information or stories from the revelation creatively adapted to a child's level of comprehension. One program consisted of a puppet show. Another involved the children in drawing representations of the concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness. (Could you do that?). Sometimes a story from “Tales of Joshua” by Dr. Robert Slagle is read. There are usually between five and ten children in attendance ranging in age from two to eleven years. _The Urantia Book_ is not read during these children's meetings although some of the older kids may have begun reading the book at home. Among these children and their parents are: Berkeley, Sammy, and Claire (9, 5, and 1 1/2), children of Mike and Beth Challis; Coury and Ryan (11 and 3), children of Lyn and Mike Davis; Jessica (4 1/2), daughter of Barbara Hester; Michelle (7), daughter of Colleen Holden; Cory (9), son of Don Muir, Janelle (8), daughter of David Muir, and others.

One of the signal achievements of the Oklahoma Society has been its development of celebrations commemorating Jesus' Birthday on August 21st. This celebration began in 1956 and has become a grand tradition of the Society. Last year the celebration took place in a large banquet hall in a beautiful hotel. Well over a hundred people attended the event. Each year Bill Allen sings “The Birthday Party of The King” accompanied by Tom on the piano, and invited speakers deliver inspiring addresses. This year, the speaker was Carol Hay of Boulder, Colorado, who is known by many for her remarkable presentation at Snowmass, 1990.

## The Study Groups

Perhaps the most important factor contributing to the progress of this cohesive society is its study groups. On Sunday and Monday nights, large study groups meet at the home of Berkeley Elliott. These meetings focus on the diverse special interests of the readers themselves. One individual assumes the responsibility of facilitating the group study on a particular theme which he or she has chosen. These special studies continue for about six to ten weeks when the facilitator and topic is changed. The Sunday group is currently being conducted by Richard Randall who has chosen an interesting theme for his period of leadership, personality. Each reader is sharing and discussing his or her favorite passages from _The Urantia Book_ and commenting on its special meaning.

The Monday group is progressing through part IV very slowly and with much discussion. As of this writing they are devoting two successive meetings to just one section of one of the “Jesus Papers”. This assembly has adopted the unusual title: “The Self-Conscious and Slightly Self-Centered Urantia Book Study Group”. Clyde Lewis, contact person for this study group is one of its prominent members.

The Tuesday night group gathers at the home of Van and Helen Butler. This group is the original cluster of friends who gave rise to the Oklahoma Society, some of whom have been studying together since 1957. They have met at several different places during their extended history and have an average of 12 to 18 members in attendance. The meeting usually begins with prayer, after which members read sequentially through the book, as they always have. When one of the more difficult papers is to be read, some of the meeting time is spent on one of the Jesus Papers as well.

There is a meeting on Wednesdays hosted by John Burchell in Bethany, a suburb of Oklahoma City (as well as of Jerusalem). In contrast with the thirtyfive years of experience of the Oklahoma Society, this group is in its infancy, having been organized only three months ago (as of this writing). John was pursuing a twelve step program where he made some acquaintances who became friends. John had read the book through twice, and when he asked some of these close friends over to read a little from the book, they were immediately taken with it, and that was the foundation of the new study group. John and the group intend to experiment with different ways to approach the study of _The Urantia Book_. The group has grown rapidly and there is a strong desire on John's part, for himself and his friends, to improve their comprehension of the book, their general understanding of reality, and to achieve a more definite “conscious contact”, as he put it, “with all of what is going on”.

Thursday a study group meets in Tulsa at the home of Wanda and Mike Smith. Among the regular members are: Nancy Oakley, Kathy Miller, Kathy Madison, Don Gardner, Gary Dangerfield, and Charles Audraine. Some members of this group have been meeting for over twenty years. Nancy Oakley shared with me that this group has developed a pervasive sense of unconditional love and acceptance. She commented that although all members do not always agree on every issue, there is always a strong group feeling of approval which she described as: “I love you no matter what.” Sometimes, meetings begin or end with prayer, the group standing in a circle holding hands. The sense of spiritual closeness, Nancy shared, makes these meetings a special experience for its members. About once a month, Tom and Karen Allen, Berkeley Elliott, and sometimes others make the ninety-mile journey to Tulsa to fellowship with these readers.

I have been present at a few of the meetings at Berkeley's home and I was strongly impressed when I observed that, unlike the majority of study groups that I have attended, the quiet and concentration was remarkable. Small, simultaneous exchanges between two or a few readers while consideration is being directed toward the subject for the evening are strictly prohibited. This rule is upheld by the facilitator as one of her or his assigned duties. Readers hear each other out and do not interrupt the reading of passages. This stipulation is observed so considerately and completely that I did not witness even a mild reprimand from the facilitator or anyone else throughout.

Group worship is another important feature of these Sunday and Monday night meetings. These expressions of love, gratitude, and reverence for the Father and His celestial family are a natural, spiritual overflow of the loving feelings and personal appreciation evoked by the evening's reading. These periods of worship are customarily enhanced by instrumental and vocal music. The sharing, socializing, study, worship, mưsic, and conversation at these gatherings do not take place within a couple of hours, but generally last the entire evening.

The Oklahoma Society does not proselytize. To join, one simply expresses his desire to become a member and, after compliance with the specific responsibilities of membership, arrangements are made for him or her to be inducted at the next celebration of Jesus' Birthday. Membership includes several factors including a commitment to assist in the dissemination of the teachings and to incorporate the values and ideals into one's life.

The numerous creative projects which are always under way involve many society members and lend further substance and cohesiveness to the Oklahoma society of readers. A revelator remarks that Thought Adjusters are often able to achieve a more effective transmission of their ideals and values into the minds of their mortal hosts when these indwelt personalities are engaged in the flowing idea-streams of creativity.

Another leader in the Oklahoma Society who does such creative work and who contributes very much to the life of the society is Harry McMullan III. Harry has written two booklets: “Why I believe _The Urantia Book_” and “Jesus and _The Urantia Book_.” He is also author of, “21 Steps to a Spiritual Awakening” and is working on “A Dictionary of _The Urantia Book_.”

Apart from their many accomplishments, the members of the Oklahoma Society radiate an inviting and welcoming attitude toward all who come to meet and fellowship with them, whatever the occasion. Tom Allen, the current president of First Society of Oklahoma, extends his invitation to all readers to visit the Oklahoma group whenever possible. Berkeley is a most congenial hostess and always makes sure that newcomers and guests are introduced around the circle of these gregarious readers. Such hospitality and warmth gives clear evidence that cooperative service is transformative and that genuine love is lastingly contagious and elicitous of mutual affection as well.
