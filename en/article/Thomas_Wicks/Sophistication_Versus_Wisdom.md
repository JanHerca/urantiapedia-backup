Sophistication is not just an echo from the past, a place marker in history reserved for Socrates and the Sophists. It is alive and well and continues to permeate our daily lives. Sophistication can be found in economics, politics, philosophy, music, and every other by-product of the free-willed mind. It masquerades as truth, wisdom, and love when, in reality, it is self-deception and fallacy. The Lucifer manifesto was pure sophistication. More often than not, it is borne out of selfishness, ego, pride, and gross ignorance. Hence, “Coke adds life.”

In this sophistry drunk world, we all see the need for a Foundation to protect the purity and life of _The URANTIA Book_ text. I declare that we all are ‘foundations,’ in and of ourselves. Our responsibility lies not only with what is written but also with what will be written and said.

The value of this Journal or any other medium of expression is its capacity to share thought, experiences, etc. “Sharing” is a key to perfection. Yet, what we sometimes spout with an all-wise smile, is the very subject matter that undoubtedly has had many a Divine Counselor working overtime. The purpose of _The URANTIA Book_ and all Spirit-led beings is to bring man closer to God, not sophistication. Rhetorical or verbal heroism is not achieved by baroque exuberance or imaginative speculation. The weeds of sophistication are ever choking the flowers of simplicity. We often cannot be heard for our words. Our message of salvation is soon to be consumed by the fires of overmuch verbal flag waving. The key to communication is simplicity.

Simplicity is shunned by the sophists and latter day word-prophets but consider this: the New York Philharmonic once recorded eight minutes under the title “480 seconds of silence.” The natural windsong dancing over the instruments on the open air stage, was indeed, a million seller. If the sounds of silence can literally penetrate the music world, think of the concert a few simple words can perform on one's vocal chords. We can share the most with as many people by not allowing our words to interfere with our ministry and service.
