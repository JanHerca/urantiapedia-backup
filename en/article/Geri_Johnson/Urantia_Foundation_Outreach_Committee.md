Urantia Foundation's Outreach Committee has been activated with the following committee members: Minoo Claire, Gary Deinstadt, Geri Johnson, Guy Perron, Mo Siegel, and Tamara Strumfeld. Since our first meeting in October 2020, we have defined our purpose, have set an agenda to work cooperatively with Urantia organizations, and have begun to explore ways to support new readers while also drawing individuals to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

As we have done in the past, the board and staff of Urantia Foundation will continue to support the Urantia readership community through conferences, book fairs, free book distribution efforts, and by creating promotional material that can be used on websites and social media.

We commend the joint Study Group Directory team in their efforts to identify study groups that are friendly to new readers. We are looking forward to developing avenues of outreach activities that will attract and support individuals who are new to the incomparable teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Expect to hear more from this committee as our ideas evolve from _potentials to actuals_.
