Over the past few months, we have developed a Graduation Memorial Page on the new Urantia Book Fellowship website at https://urantiabook.org/

We would like to hear your feedback and user experience so that we can best proceed with the development and improvement of the Graduation Memorial Page.

Please submit details to an administrator (Cristina Seaborn) of a loved one you would like to see included here. Please send a photo, and a paragraph or more about the person's life.

Graduation Memorial Page https://urantiabook.org/graduation-memorial

In addition, please comment on the Graduation Memorial Forum. Anybody can leave a story about a graduate here: https:// urantiabook.org/Graduation-Memorial-Forum

Please send a name with a photo and story you would like to see here to: cristina.seaborn7@gmail.com

Thank you for your help! We can't do this alone!

Cristina Seaborn, Joshua Wilson, Jena Lassiter, and Richard Daunt
