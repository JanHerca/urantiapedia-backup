It's Summer Study Session time again! A Fellowship tradition since 1963 the Summer Study Session has provided readers with the opportunity to present and participate in high quality workshops, prayerful meditation, and the joy of fellowship. Once again this year readers have planned a variety of intensive workshops for experienced students and an “Introduction to _The Urantia Book_” for new or non-readers. The Education Committee has incorporated a new format for this summer's program. In addition to the self-contained workshops, there will be short talks followed by small groups who will stay together to discuss focused questions. These talks and question-driven discussions will explore the conference theme aligned with strong educational principles.

This year's plenary speakers, Elisabeth Callahan, Angie Thurston, Mike MacIsaac, and Avi Dogim will share insights about experiencing God's presence through study, socialization, service, and spiritual communion. The evening plenary sessions will open with short worshipful experiences to provide attendees with exposure to “...other religious experiences (the diverse interpretations of other and diverse mortals) to the end that you may prevent your religious life from becoming egocentric-circumscribed, selfish, and unsocial.” ([UB 103:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_3)) The worship program will conclude on Sunday morning with a Urantia Book inspired ceremony - an invitation to worship. Although we can't begin to imagine worship on Paradise “...the spirit of it you can begin to appreciate even down here on Urantia, for the spirits of the Gods even now indwell you, hover over you, and inspire you to true worship.” [UB 27:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_5)

Saturday night socials are always special. At the Summer Study Session in 2015 , we enjoyed a celebration of the 60 th anniversary of the publishing of _The Urantia Book_ and the beginning of Urantia Brotherhood. Those who attended SSS18 will remember non-stop laughter during the party that included the “Apostles” “Musical Chairs.” This year's Saturday Evening Social is dedicated to our Universe Mother Spirit and the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing! Plan to be there to discover the relationship! The Reversion Directors envision short talks, videos, humor and great refreshments.

Pre-conference events include a spiritual retreat “Getting to Know Your Spiritual Parents,” with Kaye and Bill Cooper, Sharon Porter and Mary Huggins, meeting from Tuesday, June 25^th^ at dinner to Thursday, June 27^th^ at noon, and a Society Conclave scheduled on Thursday, June 25^th^. After the conference the Fellowship's General Council will meet from Sunday, June 25^th^ after lunch through Tuesday, June 2 nd at noon. Visitors are welcome to observe.
