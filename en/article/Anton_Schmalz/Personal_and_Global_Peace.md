_To the caterpillar it is the end of the world — to the rest of us it's a butterfly._

Can this be the analogy for a non-violent transfiguration process to a culture of peace? The ideal of the inner peace of many individuals multiplying into increasing global peace is an energizing ideal, indeed.

But, first, consider: Is peace a natural or intended condition of humankind? Is peace a realistic or achievable possibility for day-to-day living? If so, what's holding up the parade? Other questions confront us. Are ideals merely fantasies unlikely to be experienced in our “reality”? Given the state of human egos, motives, behaviors, relationships and fears in our world today, where do we start, and where do we look for the inspiration and confidence to pursue ideals?

I propose that we start with our own consciousness, and look there for the answers to these questions. A change in consciousness can generate strange tensions as well as revelations. Suddenly we see what was there all the time and wonder how it could have been “invisible” to us for so long.

## The choices we make for inner peace

The prospects for peace at all levels have been expressed with loving confidence many times over the millennia. Ancient beliefs which inspired authors of some of the Dead Sea Scrolls include a faith in the collective power of humanity to choose which future we will experience. From the Gregg Braden translation of the two-millennia-old Scroll of Isaiah we are assured that: “_We may change the outcome of our future through the choices we make in each moment of the present. Through our choice of peace in our lives, we ensure the survival of our species, and the future of the only home we know._”

You are a reservoir of reassuring experiences in your own life. As you reflect on your own and others experiences through human history, you can appreciate that ideals have transformed many times into functional reality. Your reflections can also inspire patience. While ideals do materialize all the time, they tend to do so as a process, rather than as a “magical” event. Gandhi reminds us that: “_Our greatness lies not so much in being able to change the world as in being able to change ourselves._”

What are some of the resources available to help us achieve our own ideal of an increasingly peaceful humanity in these times? Well, for openers, the Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded for Physics in 2001 was powerfully encouraging.

## One energy in the universe?

The 2001 prize was awarded essentially for demonstrating that there is only one energy in the universe. This single energy simply manifests at different levels of vibration, frequency, and intensity. This single cosmic energy renders the full spectrum of possibilities from visible to invisible; from liquid to solid to gas; from positive to negative; from violence in both its verbal and physical forms to compassionate nurturing of both inner and outer peace.

Increasing evidence is accumulating that proves that this single energy is susceptible to outside influences. This energy is the “stuff' of eternal, impersonal, creative, and sometimes revolutionary possibilities in the universe. It is also responsive to influences such as human thoughts, needs, values, fears, interpretations, emotions, beliefs, etc.. Further, it is responsive to your thoughts, to my thoughts, to group thoughts, and to a ”critical mass" of thought focused on a single ideal such as peace. Now we can consciously influence other people and institutions more powerfully then we may presently realize. Change is the only certainty.

Each of us is a work in progress. A smorgasbord of possibilities awaits our individual choices. ***Ultimately it is by the wisdom of our choices and consistency between our talk and our actions expressed through people and human relationships that we get things done.***

“One's philosophy is not best expressed by words: It is expressed in the choices one makes. In the long run, we shape ourselves. The process never _ends until we die. And, the choices we make are ultimately our personal responsibility._” Eleanor Roosevelt

Our deepest wisdom counsels that we need each other. The grace with which we adapt to life's changes and other realities can be a measure of our maturity. We are invited to be accepting and forgiving of people who do not universally share the same customs, values and priorities. We think and function differently. And that often makes life more interesting and challenging.

## Was 9/11 a call to a new level of consciousness?

Many people around the world regarded the 9/11 tragedy as a wake up call. They were motivated to choose to commit their energies to more peaceful attitudes and lifestyles. For example, increasing numbers of people are learning to be more sincere and open to new ideas. They are finding that the benefits are remarkable in terms of health, happiness, time together as families, less stress, etc.

Today, global humanity is rapidly embracing the painful reality that the old ways just don't work anymore. Obviously then, more universally conscious and wiser ways are needed now to transcend the old ways — many of which are now recognized as ultimately destructive. The “new ways” we evolve are likely to require a better and higher level of aspiration and achieving goals.

_A “can do” attitude seems to multiply itself into faith, enthusiasm, confidence, and active support._ On the other hand, traditional behaviors based on promises, excuses, blaming, forms of intimidation, “cleverness,” and other deceptions, no longer work — and perhaps they never have.

Today, increasing numbers of scientists are maturing and “making friends” with the likely eventuality that they may never know “everything” they would like to know. With what they do know, however, these scientists seem comfortable bestowing credence to an optimistic spectrum of both ancient and modern beliefs, prophecies and “revelations.” The essence of these expressions includes:

- **We are one humanity** sharing, and responsible for, all aspects of one environment.
- **Natural law** pervades and ultimately controls everything in the cosmos. The core intent of natural law is balance. It is incredibly elastic and forgiving. At our peril, we abuse its limits. 
- **Infinite possibilities** can be energized by the fountain of everything potential and existent, the “Divine,” if you will. And this source is within and available to each of us equally for the full range of human choices and expressions from peace to violence, from health to illness, from compassion to hurtfulness. You can make your own list of polarized choices. We make our own heavens and hells.
- **Gender equality** transcending separatism in all its forms is the intent of natural law. Balance, cooperation, harmony, forgiveness and compassion are the prominent building blocks underlying peaceful conditions. Though the genders do, indeed, have differences, one gender is not superior to the other!
- **We can choose** to open our individual aviaries and let our doves of peace fly everywhere freely.

Tragically, the hearts of many women and men are still afflicted with the persuasion that computers and other technologies will save us from our sometimes stubborn and downright stupid ways and decisions.

## Finding the human in technology

In his 2002 Nobel Prize Award Keynote Speech, the “Father of the Internet,” Vint Cerf, patiently counsels those who over-invest their hopes in technologies:

“_The Internet is a place, an environment, made up of people and their myriad interactions. It is not merely a technology but a new way of cooperating, sharing and caring. Businesses that recognize the human aspect of the Internet will be more likely to find success in the artificial worlds of the Digital Age, for they will understand that the artificial is rooted in reality and reality is rooted in our hearts._”

What is the conviction of my heart and of your heart today? Every person on the planet is conditioned by, and in varying degrees continues to be influenced by, the status quo. “The way we've always done things around here,” is attractive to some egos, and exceedingly satisfying for the bottom lines of some very powerful interests.

Persuasive incentives are embedded in the status quo. For some people it is extremely profitable. For others, the cultural and economic status quo bestows considerable power, even life or death power. In some cases, intimidation and domineering can be the functional reality — literally an addiction — at all levels of human relationships — in families, communities, work-places and governments, etc.

After all, for a very long time now, considerable profits, jobs, and other economic benefits have too often been accruing to violence-oriented behaviors. In a very real sense, humanity has rewarded, and perhaps even become dependent on, violence.

Fortunately, the ideal of Peace has also been “germinating” in human consciousness in some form since our earliest beginnings. How and what can we do to make Peace attractive enough to be _profitable_ — _more profitable_ than our current ways? In _The Power of Myth_ TV series, Joseph Campbell declares that: “_The myths and legends of cultures and traditions across all of humanity have the same intention — to help each of us to open up, to be in touch with the Divine within._”

In _The Urantia Book_, we are reminded that: “_Peace is the social yardstick measuring civilization's advancement ... War is rapidly becoming culturally bankrupt ... incapable of producing dividends of social gain in any way commensurate with the terrible losses attendant upon its invocation. ... While antagonisms are natural, peace is secured only by some sort of social regulative system._” <a id="a96_395"></a>[[UB 70:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_1)]

Asking the truly comprehensive questions then, and sincerely listening to and considering the answers as early in the manifestation process as possible, can be decisive for the desired outcome. Otherwise, the unacknowledged or rejected questions persist in their unattended festering. Have you noticed that unresolved issues tend to persist unless, and until, they claim our attention?

How sincerely are you willing to consider, to learn from and to benefit from, the generous lessons from your own life's relationships and experiences, as well as those from other histories? Michelangelo is an impressive role model. In the 87^th^ of his 89 years of unsurpassed creativity in several art forms, he declared, “***I am still learning.***”

## Nurturing a culture of peace

What can we do about our personal and culturally limited habits and perceptions? They are too often narrow rather than comprehensive and wise. Do you think that you and many other people would be willing to “sacrifice” thoughtless, reactive and hurtful habits of dealing with issues? In 5,000 years of recorded history, there is little detectable learning about evolving and committing to a culture of peace. With the power of personal choices and commitments we can change, and we can motivate others to change, course toward the ideal of more peaceful lifestyles.

A couple of Albert Einstein's famous observations help focus our challenge to become increasingly peaceful: “_Today's problems cannot be solved with the same mentality that created them.” “Imagination is more powerful than intellect._”

Clearly then, different conditions and different outcomes in our lives will demand that we redirect our life's energies into different needs, values, beliefs, ideals, priorities and incentives.

Can we visualize some overwhelming incentives to embrace more peaceful ways? What are some of the barriers to transcending the status quo? Is there an unspoken competition between the two? How motivated are you to devote your own energies into increasingly peaceful lifestyles?

In our personal and workplace lives, our desires and possibilities often fall short of expectations and even actual needs. We overlook, deny, or otherwise avoid asking the pertinent questions which would ensure the most comprehensive answers, including the identification of things we do not know and may have to research further. For example:

- How routinely and comprehensively is the **context** of the issue acknowledged?
- Are the realities of **time** considered beyond the blinding incentives to merely promise for a budget or a fiscal year or an electoral cycle?
- How can **resources** be redistributed to establish peaceful and routinely functioning behaviors, relationships and institutions?

What would be a wise and constructive alternative to any form of violence — verbal or physical? Again, are we now ready and willing to profit from the learning curve of human history regarding our failures to understand ourselves, to acknowledge our errors, and to emphasize the peaceful — the wise — resolution of differences and other issues in all our relationships? _It is beneficial to remember that knowledge and credentials do not ensure wisdom._

## A peace action plan for individuals

What are we doing today to become increasingly peaceful individuals? What are we doing to prepare for an increasingly peaceful global humanity? How do we redirect the energies we have habitually channeled negatively? How do we redirect the adrenaline to which we may have become addicted?

The fact of a single energy in the universe clearly anoints each of us to be “stewards” of our personal energy, our consciousness, our environment and all of our resources. Let us transcend the temptation to regard ourselves as helpless and fearful “victims” on the planet.

Choices themselves are expressions of energy. And, a central tenant of many ancient and modern prophecies and belief systems is that “energy follows thought and form flows from energy.” Additionally, it seems to follow that a state of consciousness — a thought, an idea — which is embraced wholeheartedly will translate into action, experiential or material. 

The “feel good” word “peace” is freely expressed by many people, their governments and other institutions. But, how freely do we experience peace in our day-to-day choices, relationships and experiences? Is there a reasonable consistency between our talk and our actions? If you are holding out for a supernatural epiphany of all humankind, perhaps peace is not achievable after all. If you expect the roots of peace to be someone else's responsibility, it might be more useful to rethink that expectation.

2500 years ago, the Chinese leader and philosopher, Lao Tse, explained how each of us is a pathway to peace:

“_If there is to be peace in the world, There must be peace in the nations._”

“_If there is to be peace in the nations, There must be peace in the cities._”

“_If there is to be peace in the cities, There must be peace between neighbors._”
“_If there is to be peace between neighbors, There must be peace in the home._”

“_If there is to be peace in the home, There must be peace in the heart._”

Peace will not be a magical bestowal or an event. Can you believe in the possibility that peace is a work already in evolutionary process? It appears to be flowing from, and paced by, the cumulative commitments of one individual at a time. Globally, the numbers of these indivduals do seem to be swelling dramatically.

Even in what often seems to be the perceived absence of trusted, respected and inspiring leaders such as a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King, a Mandela, a Franklin, a Jefferson, a Lincoln, a Churchill, or a Roosevelt, the peace process may already be evolving from the bottom up rather than from the top down in the rhetoric of leaders.

A wise process for achieving a culture of peace is offered every week as the opening declaration of purpose for the National Public Radio program _New Dimensions_:

“_It is only through a change in human consciousness that the world will be transformed. The personal and the planetary are one. As we expand our awareness of mind, body, psyche and spirit, and bring that awareness actively into the world, so, also, will the world be changed. This is our quest._”

You, too, have much to contribute to the peace process through your own choices. Everyone is welcome to contribute to helping this ideal materialize. The “golden rule” is the central tenant of all the world's religions, a common thread of ethical living and charitable behavior. If you sincerely think peace, act accordingly in all your attitudes, habits, relationships and other experiences.

Can peace — personal and global — be the Holy Grail of so many legends and quests?

_A Course in Miracles_ encourages a powerfully succinct self concept for our quest:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>“I am the light of the world.</li><br>
<i>Forgiveness is my function.</li><br>
<i>Love is my purpose.</li><br>
<i>Peace is my destiny.”</li><br>
</p>

Your commitment is always welcome in the process to evolve the culture of peace. Today's choices are tomorrow's opportunities — and outcomes.

***There may not be a “way” to peace. Peace is the way!***
