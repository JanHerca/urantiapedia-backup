We invite and encourage all students of _The Urantia Book_ to attend this year’s Midwest Conference in Normal, Illinois **16—18 August, 2019**.

The uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence do not in any manner contradict the concept of the universal sovereignty of God. All evolutionary creature life is beset by certain inevitabilities that, while wise in their manner of teaching and problem-solving development, make life seem harsh and confusing to us mortals. The ultimate question being: “Why do bad things happen to good people?” That is sometimes followed by: “If God loves me, then why does he not remove the cruel and unjust situations of life?” or “Why didn’t Jesus just heal everyone?”

Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure. The Inevitabilities illustrate the uncertainty we have unified with the security we need—uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of our lives, uncertainty as an inexperienced citizen of the universe—a “child” of God; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father; security as an ascending child of an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-loving Father.

Our indwelling Adjuster cannot stop or even materially alter our career struggles of time; the Adjuster cannot lessen the hardships of life as we journey through this world of toil. The divine indweller can only patiently look on as we fight the battles of life as it is lived on Urantia. But the valiant Adjuster will fight with us and for us if we invite and allow him to do so. We can be comforted and inspired, enthralled and intrigued, if we allow our Adjuster to show us the real motive and the eternal purpose of all this difficult, uphill struggle with the commonplace problems of daily life.

Through the Inevitabilities, we see both the hardships of life but the reason and purpose for them. How can we calm and strengthen ourselves to bear these burdens and work with our Adjusters to turn them into blessings and recognize the benefits and value of this forward struggle? How do we conquer our fears of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, avoid doubts of failure or perplexing confusion, and not falter or question our status and standing as a child of God?

At the 2019 Urantia Midwest Conference, we hope to learn how to recognize the spiritual counterpart of all these strenuous life struggles; allow our Adjuster to strengthen us with spiritual truths while we wrestle with the difficulties of “such a life on such a planet,” be encouraged by the heavenly helper to cheer us with a clear vision of the eternal life as we gaze in perplexity at the problems of the day.

We hope that by attending our event you will be enlightened and inspired by a cosmic viewpoint while you toil amidst the handicaps of time and flounder in the maze of uncertainties.

The main program will consist of three study periods. In each study period, Benet Rutenberg will introduce three of the Inevitabilities. We will then break up into discussion groups with an assigned leader and one of the Inevitabilities. Michael Painter will then lead the group discussion at the end of each period.

On Sunday, Alice Wood will conduct a wonderful worship based on a service by Marcia McFee but adapted to the Urantia teachings. This will include some musical worship as well.

Following Alice will be a presentation by Jimmer Prieto of Goshen, Indiana about “The Lord’s Prayer.” Jimmer gave this presentation in a workshop at the Netherlands conference. We heard many good things about this presentation and participated in it as a study group lesson. You will find it very interesting and inspiring. Jimmer will also be offering his spiritual Tae Chi each morning.

You will also have the opportunity to meet leaders of this revelation in the United States as the Council of Local Presidents from Urantia Association of the United States will be hosting their annual meeting on Friday afternoon.

Normal, Illinois, is a true midwestern town with the feel and hospitality midwesterners are known for. We invite all students of _The Urantia Book_ to join us and participate in this event.
