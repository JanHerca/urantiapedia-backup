I’m composed and full of feeling  
I’m en-wrapped in silent healing  
The air flows cool in the Father’s mountains  
There isn’t much to say  
How we spend each pleasant day,  
But know, deep down within,  
That God’s Spark is close to Him

Our walks of life take different tolls  
Of moods, of thoughts, we’re all different moulds  
Sometimes we cry for inner peace  
We’re glad to have a part, a piece  
of life adjusting—inwardly and outwards

Then the chores of climbing and the upward search  
To find a cloud, a rising perch  
The pilot watches, waits and prompts us  
The waiting seems in patience dwells  
We burn the midnight oils of searching  
To do the will, within ourselves

I’m looking back on years of thinking  
I’m slowly moving, surely not sinking  
And while I have the goal in sight,  
I’ll carry on my God-ward flight,  
Merging, feeling, it’s a pleasant surprise  
To grasp, enjoy and embrace all my ties
