## Bio

Berkeley left Urantia in 1995, but what she really left to those of us who knew her as a best friend, was an amazing devotion and startling affection. Her involvement in Urantia affairs began in the late 1950s when she inherited the Herculean task of compiling and publishing Bill Sadlerâ€™s A Study of the Master Universe and the Appendices. She was instrumental in the development and chartering of several societies, led several weekly study groups in her home, and she was compelling in getting others to serve. She was chair of the International Fellowship Committee, masterfully organized numerous conferences, traveled extensively, and had unparalleled endurance and energy. Her humor was infectious, her friendship superb, and her ideas about how the Urantia community should be were strong. Those of us who knew her well knew her faults, but they pale to insignificance in the face of the legendary service and love she provided to everyone she met.
