_By Ralph and Betty Zehr, New York, United States_

_Editor's Note: Marjorie Reed, a Iongtime reader of _The Urantia Book_ and a friend of Urantia Foundation, has graduated to the mansion worlds. On behalf of the expanded board, we all miss her, cherish our times with her, and are so grateful to her service and contributions to Urantia Foundation._

Marjorie Reed touched many lives as a result of her long and deep commitment to the Urantia community. She was indeed a remarkable woman. And for those who were privileged to know her, she was a dear friend, a role model, a mentor, and a most delightful fellow worker on Urantia Book projects and committees. She was dedicated to spreading the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and raising the necessary funds to seed it throughout the world.

As a long-term, dedicated member of the Education Committee, Marjorie made a personal commitment to share the teachings. She was responsible for planning programs for the intensive Summer Study Sessions at Lake Forest College year after year when they were held there during the 1980s. As a resident of Lake Forest, she was able to arrange this beautiful and serene setting as the venue. She hosted many of the committee meetings in her home, providing lodging during the two- to three-day committee sessions along with simple, elegant meals at her home and transportation to and from the airport. She also worked behind the scenes at these conferences, personally supplying various needed services, especially to international attendees. In addition to her extensive work sharing the teachings, Marjorie was also dedicated to providing funds necessary to support the widespread distribution of Urantia Books throughout the world. She served on the Urantia Foundation Fundraising Committee, a job for which she possessed considerable experience and expertise. Not only was she an effective fundraiser, Marjorie set an excellent example by her most generous personal contributions given over the years.

While she is no longer with us, her inspiration continues. Let us all work together with continued service and the raising of much-needed funds that allow us to share the teachings and achieve the world that Marjorie so clearly envisioned.
