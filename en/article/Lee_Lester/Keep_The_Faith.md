_By Lee Lester, Saratosa, Florida_

We greatly enjoyed the recent celebration of the Master's birth on our planetary home. Although we couldn't gather together in one place as we are scattered from one end of the planet to the other, the brotherhood of faith sons were united in spirit if not in locality. The newsletters after the event seemed like the echo of the same note — “This was definitely the best yet.” We in Sarasota, Florida, USA, like many others, observed the remembrance of Michael's planetary bestowal. Our's was a joyous occasion, commemorating the life Jesus lived among his fellows and the faith he had for their faith in his Father. Our thoughts were turned back like pages in time to the evening when Jesus established the remembrance with his mortal associates so long ago.

The twelve arrived at the upper chamber before the Master. They noticed pitchers of water, the basins, and towels for washing their dusty feet, but no servant had been provided to render this service. The apostles began to think to themselves, each one refusing in his own heart to act as a servant to the others.

As they stood there debating in their hearts, they surveyed the seating arrangement of the table. Traditionally the preferred guest reclined at the seat of honor to the left of the host. A certain apostle chose this place for himself, setting in motion a scene of angry recriminations, personal exultation, and uncomplimentary remarks.

When the Master appeared in the doorway, the room fell quiet. Jesus looked at each one and eased the tension with a smile.

“_Why are you so slow to learn that the secret of greatness in the spirit is not like the methods of power in the material world?_”

“_Jesus feared none of those who sought his spiritual overthrow anymore than those who sought his death. He had but one anxiety, the safety and salvation of his earthly brethren._”

“_Now the Master instituted a new remembrance as a symbol of the new dispensation, a new spirit wherein the enslaved individual emerges from the bondage of ceremonialism and selfishness into the spiritual joy of the brotherhood of the liberated faith sons of the living God._”

We have all had experiences when beliefs have caused divisions between even the closest associates. Faith on the other hand, unites those who share even the most diverse beliefs. If you were to search for the definition of belief in the dictionary, you would find the word ‘faith’. Likewise if you sought the word ‘faith’, you would find the word 'belief. The only way to know the true meaning of either is through living experience.

At some point in our experience we may even find it necessary to choose between what we believe and the faith we have within. Jesus walked this path as a young boy when he made his first journey to Jerusalem with his parents.

Jesus would not accept belief in the wrath of God or the anger of the Almighty. When his father became mildly insistent that he accept the orthodox Jewish beliefs, Jesus refused to believe anything that should assault his faith in his Paradise Father's love.

Diversity of beliefs unquestionably provides the basis for insightful exchange between progressive and truth searching personalities, but as Jesus demonstrated through a faith-choice decision, the highest ideal should never be sacrificed for an inferior idea.

Each of us are the captains of our own ships. The indwelling fragments of Deity are the pilots charting the course of progressive evolutionary destiny, but as the Master once said, “_faith is like the sails of a ship_”. And unless the sails of our ship are hoisted up, the ship will either drift aimlessly, remain motionless, or can even flounder and crash when the waves of adversity strike.

Jesus also once said, “_if you have faith that your Paradise Father loves you with an infinite love, you are already in the kingdom of heaven_”. This faith can only be realized by trusting in God's infinite goodness.

The religion of Jesus Christ will forever stand in contrast to complicated, intricate, and dictatorial forms of philosophical beliefs. So simple, that even the most wide-eyed child can understand: God loves you and we are all his children.
