Some time past, on a fortunate day,
without intention I chanced to stray,
a trifle from my appointed way.
To a used bookstore with crowded aisles.
Books everywhere in stacks and piles.

As my eyes adjusted to the gloom,
within this dim-lit dusky room,
the shadows all but did consume
the legends on each titled spine.
One beckoned me, and I read the line.

“The Central and Super Universe
Complete.”
What a singularly awesome feat,
an astounding literary treat.
A bright blue volume tooled in gold.
What treasured knowledge could it hold.

Perhaps chance was not my guide that day.
Deliberate plan may have paved the way,
while unseen forces were brought into play.
Closer I peered for a better look.
A strange title…”_The Urantia Book_.”

Urantia? What a curious word.
A peculiar one I’d never heard.
Was it profound, or merely absurd?
The first line of the book, made claim,
“Urantia” is the Spiritual name,

Of this our planet, our home, our world.
While around the sun our system hurled,
And far beyond, the universe swirled.
With endless systems much like ours.
All made by design of higher powers.

If this, in fact, is the actual case.
Then we’re not alone in infinite space.
There’s real purpose to the human race.
Our existence has rationality,
with order, design and destiny.

Could I dare to hope, trust or surmise,
that here in my hands, before my eyes
lay revealed an unparalleled prize?
Would answers now be given me?
To questions that have driven me?

Would this knowledge now at my command,
Finally help me to understand.
How all of existence was really planned?
Great pearls of promise on every page,
dispatched to earth by celestial sage.

This just might be the golden key.
To answers that could set us free,
unlocking the door of mystery.
To the portal where enigma resides.
The scared place where wisdom abides.

Where all schools of thought are in
compliance,
Philosophy, Art, Religion and Science.
In one harmonious alliance.
To a table in a near-by nook
with eager hands I carried the book.

My mind with curiosity burned.
For printed on each page I turned,
were new perceptions to be learned.
Data extracted from time and space.
Bestowed on us from a lofty place.

On each fascinating page I read,
the incredible things the volume said.
Not the deceit of victors, long dead.
Who, truth had twisted, then realigned
to sooth their conscience and quiet their
mind.

Retreating in time to the absolute start.
To when the “I AM” first moved apart.
Beyond all beginnings that we can chart,
Infinity, Eternity, time and space.
Each one assigned to its rightful place.

To the Creator’s first volitional act.
When endless void was forever cracked,
When time and space became a fact.
Unfolding eons from then ‘til now.
Revealing why, what, where, when and how.

It said we’re a part of that infinite source.
Alive within the eternal force,
embarking on an immortal course.
For every soul that seeks survival,
a place awaits for their arrival.

On the far off shore of our endless quest,
we’ll be greeted as a welcome guest
and treated to a well earned rest.
A brief sojourn on this mansion sphere,
then onward with our immortal career.

Once you’ve chosen this course to stay,
Forever within, the spirit will say
“doubt not, nor falter, this is the way.”
As you listen to that still small voice
Reminding, you it’s always your choice.

In the darkness every soul is blind.
Face into the light and you will find,
the shadows of fear all fall behind.
While deep in your mind it still rings true
And you realize that you always knew.

Although you’ll encounter shades of gray,
by seeking the light, come what may,
there is no failure, only delay.
Your destiny is never in doubt.
The survival plan is all worked out.

Because we host the creator’s spark.
It’s never too late for us to embark,
on the well-lit path out of the dark.
Inward and homeward age after age,
On a trek mapped out page after page.

There’s no adventure that is greater,
Than the Quest that sooner or later.
Returns us all to our Creator.
Even as our “Elder Brother” knew.
His Father is our Father, too.

With his life on earth he tried to show,
His love for us, so we would know.
God’s love for his children here below.
No cruel God of spite or jealousy.
But one who nurtures us lovingly.

Who reaches out across time and space.
A small fragment of himself to place,
within the minds of the human race.
Each living soul is his to cherish.
He never meant that any should perish.
