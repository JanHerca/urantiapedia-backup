## Volunteer Opportunities at IC '96

The IC '96 Planning committee would like to extend an invitation for conference attendees in the following areas:

**Toddler Program** — Work with children six months through four years in a stimulating outdoor play environment and also indoors with arts and crafts and stories. Although this is a cooperative parent program, non-parents are warmly encouraged to volunteer also. Call Beth Wenger at (602) 971-8247.

**Youth Program** — Imagine yourself living in the times of Jesus, with weaving and pottery and Roman soldiers looking over your shoulders. The five through 12 years olds will be creating a Jerusalem Fair and could use your help. Call Sara Blackstock at (707) 747-1854.

**Teen Program** — Challenge, adventure, music and games. The teens will be fully engaged during the entire conference getting to know each other and themselves. If you can help, call Doug Parker at (541) 994-3264.

**Transportation** — The Youth Program and Teen Program are planning offcampus activities that require transportation. Call Rhonda Grubb at (602) 841 7649 .

**Afternoon Activities** — We still need volunteers to help with family activities in the afternoon. Call Tony Finstad at (206) 402-4315.

**Moving Crews** — We need people to help move tables, chairs and production equipment each day. If you have a strong back and would like to help, call Arley Grubb at (602) 841-7649.

Thanks for your help.
