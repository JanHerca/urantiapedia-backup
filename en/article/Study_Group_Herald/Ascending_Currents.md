Thank you, Father-Mother, for the
gift of yourself to us through others.

We pray for love and tolerance that we 
may continue to grow in appreciation of

The beauty and goodness of this wonderful 
gift you have bestowed upon us:

The gift of our sisters and brothers.

Lead us into wisdom.

Guide us to truth and inspire us to love, 
that we may see more clearly

The closeness of Your presence in the 
faces of those around us.

As Your Son, our Creator-Father, lived 
a perfect life of service among us,

Help us to follow his example and love 
one another as he loved us.

We look forward with joyful anticipation 
to the fullness of the revelation of 
community,

When we will sometime experience it in 
your embrace on Paradise. Amen.

_Jim Schelstrate_

Loving Father, Tnder Mother,
You have blessed me with joy,

A warm happiness so deep as to define 
serenity.

I pray to You not only in appreciation 
but in continual wonder,

Of a small and simple thought that is 
the foundation of my being:

You are always in me and I in You.

_Matthew Klein_

Dear God, we pray

That we may more faithfully cooperate 
with the spirit of Your indwelling.

That we may more cheerfully endure 
the tasks of Your emplacement.

That we may more faithfully carry out 
the program of Your selection.

That we may more persistently tread 
the paths of Your choosing.

That we maymore humbly receive credit 
that may accrue as a result of your 
ceaseless endeavors.

Let us not ever forget Your divine 
affection and devotion for each and every 
one of us.

And may we avail ourselves of Your 
divine power and wisdom until the very 
end, until the last earth struggle is over.

The poetry of my soul is drawn from 
the well of human-divinity

Deep within this cavern of flesh flows 
the true river of refreshment
Life-giving wine
Divine drinking in
Thinking in thoughts

Well water, well water
Water me well with Your divine wine
spirits of sages
wisdom of the ages
fountain of youth 
fountain of truth

Building block, I am carved from the 
rock of human-divinity

And the river within flows forth with 
words and wishes like loaves and fishes

For Jesus lives inside of me with the 
Father fragment guide I see my soul of 
human-divinity

Watered well with words to tell of that 
which dwells within my soul

The spirit and mind are intertwined 
and God is the treasure at the heart 
of the whole creation 
the foundation 
the source

From which spring the waters of wonderful 
words that sing like birds

Winging through the air and angels 
bringing answers to my prayer

His most precious love is everywhere

_K. Brendi Poppel_
