**California**: I have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for 16 years, but just joined a study group one year ago. My primary motivation for seeking a group was to have contact with other readers so I could pick their brains about how to teach this stuff to my own daughters. Of course now my primary motivation for going to study group is that I LOVE the people and to study and discuss out loud is such a joy after 15 solitary years!

**New York**: Throughout the years we have always encouraged children to participate with the adults and when the “heavy thinking” occurs, to go by themselves and enjoy carefree association with one another.

**Washington**: Anything which promotes a loving, healthy family life should be supported and encouraged since that is possibly the saddest situation in our country today. There are so many poor influences attacking children - dangers my generation never had to face in most areas, when we were kids. And a lot of us grandparent types are very concerned.

**New York**: Our most meaningful experience was having our son ask for a Urantia Book after a conference. He was a teenager at the time. He read with us for a few meetings but now chooses not to participate.

**Massachusetts**: When attending a study group, a nine-year-old girl told about her friend who was killed in an automobile accident. We read the paper on the probationary nursery in Mansonia \#1. Later she made up a play and presented it at a regional conference.

**Virginia**: I have two children aged 12 & 15 who I would like to attend, but it really doesn't seem appropriate. This book and our study of it is very advanced and a normal child simply isn't into such things. My older son has his own book, is a believer and knows much of the book; I hope one day he will show interest in attending our meetings. I have told him we would love to have him if he had any desire to participate.

**Washington**: How can we help to enrich the already present structure of the family? If “study groups” form as a result of this, all the better. But let's strengthen our families first.

**Idaho**: My study group didn't think they could participate in this survey because we have no children hanging around the fringes these days. But I remember when my children and others were home, and I know the importance of making them feel comfortable and at home on study group night. I also knew the importance of not forcing them in any way to participate. But the times that my invitation to “hang out with the group” were accepted, I usually found some small way to include the curious child. Usually I would have them read a page or so about the lad Joshua when he was of their contemporary age. I.was always impressed with how well the children could read, and praised them a little, and thanked them for reading.

**Tennessee**: For me, accepting children and their needs encourages me to put aside my own wishes and respond to others. It is also a learning experience for me to accept children's concerns as being important to them. Thankfully, most of my children's friends are members of Urantia Book reading families so even informal socializing have Urantia Book or Jesusonian values as a backdrop.

**New York**: Each child who has come (to a study group) is given so much love and attention by the group that none has abused his privilege of making good comments and participating in other ways. They seem pleased to be incorporated into the group's activities.

**Connecticut**: The snag has been, for the most part, that parents have not taken (perhaps just don't know how) initiative to give the kids a good time and some Urantia insights. There is understandably a lot of reluctance on the part of in dividuals to miss blocks of meeting time to be with the kids. Here is another angle you may have already heard: at least two families have regretted bringing their children to meetings because the children resented the boredom and their parent's preoccupation. These parents believe that the children's later reactions of disinterest, even resistance to the book, had their origin in unpleasant memories of Urantia meetings! Not easy judgement for parents of young ones to make. 

**Indiana**: We have a “Thought Adjuster” party for children when they reach the age of six. We give each child a hand-made, embroidered, cloth medallion of three blue concentric circles on white background. We have a brief ceremony which the child lights a candle representing “the light that lights every person that comes into the world.” Then each adult in turn lights their candle from the child holding his (her) candle. We read a few lines from _The Urantia Book_ about Thought Adjusters. This is done in a party or or social atmosphere and not during a regular meeting 

**California**: When they (the children) ask questions about religion we behave and reply as I at least imagine Jesus might have, with complet confidence in the reality of God, and if you will the naturalness of our relationship to him. We NEVER impose a “religious” interpretation on everyday events. If the kids ASK, we never hesitate to suggest one, but we also are sure to communicate that this is OUR PERSONAL vision and interpretation, and they may also have their own.

**Wisconsin**: Our children have grown up with knowledge of _The Urantia Book_ and Urantia activities. Although they have never asked for their own book, we decided to give them one. We have always hoped that some day they would have an enjoy their own book — whenever they are ready. Realistically, when they do become ready we may not be around. We realize what a special gift would be if their book came from their own parents. We gave them _The Urantia Book_ on “Father Day”, explaining they were gifts in celebration of our heavenly Father's love. We each wrote a personal inscription of spiritual encouragement for their reassurance in the years to come. This all happened in June 1989 when our children were 10, 12, & 15. Their Urantia Books sit patiently on bedroom shelves and I dust them off occasionnally whispering “their time will come, I'm sure!”
