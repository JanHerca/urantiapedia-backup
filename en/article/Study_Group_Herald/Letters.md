To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

June 12, 1991

Thank you for publishing my article, “Race and _The Urantia Book_” in your first issue of the STUDY GROUP HERALD. I have received numerous congratulations and a few long distance phone calls. It is a subject that lays heavy on many minds, especially among whites. The few blacks I have met who read the Book did not experience the same trauma as I did.

Just in the last several weeks, we in the Washington, D.C. area, have come across a reading group comprised of seven black people. Their group is called, The Urantia Group of Greater Metropolitan Washington. The hosts for the group are William and Elise Gainor, (301)423-5353. I have visited their group (and they visit the group at my home) and noted that they are dedicated readers and have been reading as a group for two years. Their stories of how a few of them found the Book are heartwarming. I feel so happy knowing that more and more people of the black race are discovering _The Urantia Book_. I will encourage them to participate in local gatherings and attend conferences.

May Our Father smile upon the work you are doing.

Congratulations, your first issue of the STUDY GROUP HERALD is a success, and I wish to thank you sincerely for sending a copy to me so promptly.

I'm a Zambian national now residing in Zambia after spending ten years abroad of which seven were spent in the U.S.A, in New York. It was during this period in 1982 when a friend, Elona Saren, introduced _The Urantia Book_ to me. It came just at the right time. I later met Eileen and Peter Laurence who assisted me greatly and I still value their friendship.

I enjoy and treasure all literature sent to me regarding the U.B. I use them to spread the truth around to the many “kindred spirits”. I hope someday to form a study group here, in Kitwe. Please let the U.B. readers who may chance to be in this part of the world know how to get in touch with me, I enclose a business card for more details.

I hope you will introduce a foreign readers' page.

The angels and other divine beings are working “overtime” in this part of the world as well as everywhere. It is so wonderful to see their work carried out and to feel their presence around us.

I send warm greetings to you all from sunny Zambia. 

Yours in Kingdom building,

Please accept this statement of my appreciation in regards to your having forwarded to me a copy of the STUDY GROUP HERALD. I've enjoyed reading it and I appreciate it as a gift. I now look to the day when I can reciprocate by contributing to your efforts.

Presently, my incarceration inhibits my capacity to serve your cause actively or economically; nonetheless, I offer my gratitude as a token of my appreciation for the work you are doing, and I surreptitiously pray your evolvement will continue commensurate with your meritorious projects.

In addition I must say I'm delighted in having the opportunity to witness the metamorphosis of the Urantia Brotherhood. Indeed your activity indicates your group is composed of talented, creative, energetic, inspiring, and intelligent God-seeking people. Surely your works, your plans, your objectives, and your efforts are worthy of the enobling path of THE SUPREME the evolutionary foundation of Michael's adventuous, absonite eventuality through divine faith experience in our humanity actualize as it will the potential building blocks of the Urantia Fellowship and the ever resident Urantia Brotherhood.

Finally, now I'm certain that what you are doing, what must be done by others and will best be done by all, can be accomplished effectively once fellow believers, pilgrims, or vanguards of this new revelation give more of themselves individually as a testimony of duty to our collective desire to realize the supreme destiny which Michael has promised.

This letter from Linda Scott was written by a very new reader and first-time guest to our ' 89 Jesus Birthday Party:
_(Submitted by Adrienne Jarnagin)_

HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS

Last August, 1989, a dear friend invited me to attend a birthday dinner celebration for Jesus. I was introduced to _The Urantia Book_ by this same friend, only a few weeks earlier and I really didn't have a clear idea of what to expect. After all my years on Urantia, I was amazed to find out that Jesus had not been born on December 25th. That amazement was just the beginning of what I was soon to experience.

I thought I was going to the usual dinner party like I had attended so many times during the holiday season, but I was wrong! The first thing that became obvious to me was the attitude of the other guests. It wasn't only that they were nice and friendly, they were loving. I was put at ease immediately by the sweetness in their voices, a common thread that ran through all who were there. It didn't make any difference that I wasn't known. I wasn't made to feel like a stranger. I felt as if I were with family and friends that I had known for a long time.

We socialized for awhile and then had dinner. Food that everyone had brought to share. A short time after dinner, we were all asked to form a circle in the family room and take a little time to think about one thing that we were thankful for, as well as one prayer.

As each person in that circle, one by one spoke of their gratitude to GOD and uttered their prayer, I felt a rush of radiation that ran through my whole body. I knew that each one of us in that circle was sharing a oneness with each other and a deep heartfelt love for Jesus. Truly, this was a spiritual experience. I remembered what Jesus had said about loving each other as he loves us and I knew that had happened in that room. In those few precious moments I understood the meaning of brotherhood.

After the circle had broken, a few of us went outside to drink in the night air and to reflect.I I felt so peaceful, so happy, so free. It was the kind of feeling that I could imagine a bird has as it soars above the earth. I felt free from all the ties that bind my soul to materiality. Everything seemed so right and so good.

As I was looking into the clear night sky at all the heavenly bodies twinkling and blinking, a beautiful shooting star suddenly crossed the sky. I know that shooting stars are a common sight but this one was special to me and I will always believe that this one was to let us know that Jesus was with us and was very pleased with his birthday party.

I have read alot more in the Uranria Book since last August and one thing I now know for sure, our thought adjusters really enjoyed those few hours.

In looking back and reminiscing as I write this narrative, I find that my emotions have turned to excited expectation about going to this year's birthday party for Jesus.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

June 27, 1991

I was very happy to receive the Spring, ' 91 STUDY GROUP HERALD. Although I have read the complete Urantia Book, it is very good to go back over important parts and refresh one's mind. The study series you have set up will be very helpful in this as I am in a small town 90 miles from the nearest study group, and as I don't drive at night I'm unable to attend. I have tried my very best to interest others in this area in _The Urantia Book_ but I guess they just aren't ready for the growth it will give them.

Thanks so much,

I'm delighted to have the STUDY GROUP HERALD as I am the only reader for hundreds of miles and it makes me feel like I belong to a study group.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD:

Here is a prayer that I wrote the other day when I was upset:

Never feel unloved or unwanted by your own family.

Always convert your feelings of aloneness into prayers which God can carry to the situation to help. God loves you and wants you to feel rewarded even if you're stressed to your limit.

Spiritual rewards are yours for your effort.

If you don't feel that you're getting enough communication, just have faith that people love you. Your relationship with God actually exists.

Congratulations and thank you for publishing this interesting and informative paper for all Urantia Book readers - even the children.

We have a small study group in the southeast corner of Pennsylvania, but are unique in the fact that we have people who come from three different states in our group: Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. We call ourselves the Bubs (Believers in _The Urantia Book_). We meet once a week.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD:

We wanted to thank all of the folks involved in putting together The STUDY GROUP HERALD and are looking forward to the next issue. THANX!!!

Enclosed please find a copy of a letter we received from $\mathrm{Ni}$ geria. We were thrilled to be able to fill the request for some used UBs and are planning to send more as they become available. I would like to invite anyone or any study group or society to likewise consider sending this group some books. Is it possible to share this information with the readership? We would be most grateful.

We were also wondering if you plan on having a regular feature in the SGH that focuses on family issues. We really appreciate the stories for children and my daughter enjoyed the Andon and Fonta piece. More of that, for sure!

We have received many fine notices from folks around the country (and globe) asking about the REVERSION DIREC- : TORY but we are not publishing it at this time. However, The Golden Gate Circle Society publishes DEVELOPMENTS and can be reached at 237 Rivoll St., San Francisco, CA 94117. Please replace the REVERSION DIRECTORY listing with Developments. Thank you.

Many wishes for your continued success.

In His Light,
