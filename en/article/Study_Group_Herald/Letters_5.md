To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

Some time ago I loaned a Urantia Book to Bill Ferrell, a good friend of mine with a quick, analytical and perceptive mind. I had thought he might be interested in _The Urantia Book_. After speed reading through various parts, he returned the book with some amusement. His opinion was that the book was a mish-mash of some strange thoughts and he explained that he was not interested. However he did have an idea that questions the validity of the two billion year space pulsation theory. The question is: If there is a two billion year expansion-contraction cycle, why does it not appear in the astronomical measurement of the universe? The current age of the measurable universe is generally considered to be about 15 billion years. According to _The Urantia Book_, the universe expands for one billion years, stops and then contracts for one billion years, then stops and starts expanding again. It seems in measuring the age of the universe, that these stops and starts would show up as gliches, blips, or abberations of one form or another. For the current universe age of 15 billion years, there would be about 15 such blips clearly indicating something unusual or extraordinary has been taking place. Why haven't these abberations been discovered, studied, and accounted for? Please send your explanation to George Thombury, Box 451, Pikeville, KY 41502. Thank you.

P.S. Did you know that paradise (as in the Garden of Eden) originally meant a walled city?

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

Yahoo editor and elves, and yahoo again to all sons and daughters of the Knowledge...

I just received your December issue, hasten to include a contribution for continuing receipt, wonder if the spring issue is coming soon because it is so heartening to know we are growing 'round the globe, interchange happening, happening, and the world needing more-than-ever to know the truth of the matter, but patience is called for most obviously, if your success at interesting others in the book are as dismal as mine.

I particularly enjoyed the piece on Clyde Bedell, as his _Concordex_ is a most helpful aid. I might have gone crazy without it!

I've been an astonished and grateful reader for many years, mostly solitary owing to a rural location and an unreachable social shyness that probably won't cease to be an impediment until I'm out of this combustion body. Really, the only thing I can go on and on about is _The Urantia Book_ even to the dismay of my family who look on me as a friendly kook with a fixation.

Finally, four longtime readers are meeting here in the Ukiah, Califomia area every Tuesday [(707)-743 1355] to read a paper of rotating choice. We each read three paragraphs, and it seems to go very nicely. We are just getting to know each other, but we all agree contacting the reality of the Supreme is our aim.

...Well, great things are happening even if the newspaper headlines aren't that great. In wonder and near dis-belief that the Word could have become book,

April 8, 1993

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

This letter is prompted by Sharen Clampitt's note in The HERALD under “International Readers.” Her interest in a pen-pal program (national - intemational or both) is something I have thought about and would be interested to help in

I am now living in Clearwater, Florida and am a new member of the study group here. I first got a copy of the book in 1971 in Key West, Florida. I hosted a study group there from 19811984 , meeting weekly in my home. One member, a teacher and inspiration was Joe Liszka, your Treasurer.

I have a special interest in international UB contact because I grew up in Montevideo, Uraguay, SA (1940-1950) where my father was President of the YMCA University for future Latin American “Secretaries” of The YMCA. He then returned to The U.S. and for ten years was the International Director of the YMCA with offices in New York City.

I had some ideas about a UB pen-pal program, not necessarily using The HERALD but it would certainly simplify matters if your publication were involved. Please contact me with any ideas or recommendations you may have. A penpal program would promote communicationnetworking among readers and that can only be good.

_Sincerely, Eric Nystrom_
_P.O. Box 3551, Clearwater, FL 34630_

> ED. NOTE: _Due to lateness of publication of Issue No. 3 of The STUDY GROUP HERALD we went to press with this Issue No. 4 before all of the letters in response arrived. These will be published in Issue \#5._

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

...There are very few readers in Maine and there has been no study group here for many years so it is very exciting to find new people to communicate with on this level.

Thanks so much for publishing such an exciting and touching newsletter. The interview with Clyde Bedell was especially compelling. Keep up the good work and keep in touch. .

## Patricia Amyx journeys on

_It is with “sorrow and joy” we report that following a long and difficult illness, Patricia Amyx has left Urantia. The following is an excerpt from Dan Amyx's letter to us:_

In February, Patricia was diagnosed as having colon cancer that had metastasized to the liver. She underwent surgery and three types of chemotherapy. She fought hard and lived much longer than the doctors and nurses expected. Her spiritual strength and faith were unwavering. She showed amazing courage to all who saw her. Often she would be heard comforting someone who came to comfort her.

Her love for others during this terrible time was so disarming that many of her nurses traded shifts so they could serve her. Some of these nurses came to our home to visit. Literally thousands of people were praying for her throughout the United States and from nearly forty other countries, including Russia, Poland, Austria, Malaysia, Great Britain and the Far East. Her life touched many people. Her departure is our greatest loss.

This morning [May 29, 1993] at 9:25 AM, Patricia Ann Amyx took leave to begin her Etemal Career toward Paradise. I am sure our Heavenly Father is very proud of his daughter, my wife, Patricia. She did more than her share to make this planet a better place for us all.

Donations in lieu of flowers may be sent to the PATRICIA AMYX FAMILY BENEFIT TRUST, c\% Unity Church, Kevin Goodman and Susan W. Fox Co-Trustees, 332 Horatio Ave., Tampa, Florida 33609.
