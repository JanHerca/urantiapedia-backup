Thanks to all who organized the 1995 Summer Seminar. I had been under the false impression that these events were rather “dry.” I was mistaken; it was enriching and enjoyable.

_P.A._
_Salem, MA_

The Fellowship provides a wonderful opportunity for ordinary people to come together, be inspired, and go home and do extraordinary acts which help make this world a little bit better.

_D.H._
_Hamburg, NJ_

At first I had trouble with _The Urantia Book_ because of what I had been taught and believed, so I stopped reading it. But I kept thinking about what I had read. Now I'm on my third reading.

_J.H._
_Alger, OH_

Allow the Urantia words to be spread in a natural way, not forced in a “pressured” way. Slow growth equals true progress.

_M.G._
_Slidell, LA_

Although I am not organizationally active in the movement, I'm definitely a God-directed individual. I express the views of _The Urantia Book_ to the people I come in contact with in both word and deed. I make a constant effort to follow the teachings of Michael, even when I don't understand why, because God is way beyond our comprehension. I suggest that you target the scientific, technical, medical and journalist types to expand the Urantia corps of believers. Right now it's not so important how many we are as what type we are.

_A.J.D._
_Denver, CO_

I hope there will be a reconciliation with the Foundation. Urantia readers are a small group; the planet is a big place. Consistent editions, distribution and translation are vital.

_R.S._
_Flushing, NY_

We are relieved that _The Urantia Book_ is finally in the public domain, and pray that it stays there. We believe a broader outlook is needed. More than one publisher of the book would be a very positive step. Consider the many publishers of the Bible; it hasn't hurt that book.

_G. \& G.M._
_Kansas City, MO_

The messages and requirements of _The Urantia Book_ have become central to my life. They guide me as a father of four children, as a business owner and as a business consultant. I intend to become more and more active in my personal ministry related to Urantia.

_J.R._
_Sandstone, MN_

It is truthful to say that _The Urantia Book_ has become my religion. As an individual who has sought after spiritual truths from my early youth, my chance encounter with _The Urantia Book_ in a book store 25 years ago changed my way of life. My enthusiasm for it has not altered, but I do often wonder why this revelation has not touched more mortals in high places who have so much power over the lives of so many others.

_W.C.R._
_Las Vegas, NV_


For the past four or five years I have regularly sent in Urantia Book passages to Religious Viewpoint in The Royal Gazette, which they often print. I started by signing my real name, but after getting no feedback from anybody, I simply began signing the name of the angelic being that truly authored the piece. A while back I went into a book store and saw that one of my letters had been cut out and was stuck on the wall. So, however meekly, the message is getting out there.

_T.O._
_Harrington Sound, Bermuda_
