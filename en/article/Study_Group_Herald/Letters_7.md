It is saddening to see so many people who are not interested in _The Urantia Book_. After five attempts to give the book away, only the one whom I considered not really deserving of it accepted it.

_Norman P. Owen_

Getting the message of _The Urantia Book_ out to as many people as possible, in a tactful way, is the responsibility of all who value, love and cherish this book.

I would like to contact and network with others who are in the vanguard of the outworking of the revelation, who want to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom first and foremost, whose lives have been transformed by the Spirit, and who have become infused by the personally spiritualized teachings in _The Urantia Book_.

_Peter B. Holley_

One might think, of all the movements on Urantia, ours would be the most unified. Not so. The divide has roots that go back years, but it is not justification for our disunity. Wherever one's opinion lies, it is imperative that we reconcile and present a unified (but not unanimous) front to the world. Who made mistakes is not important. What happens with this precious revelation is of paramount importance.
