If you had known Mario Harrington, especially in connection with study of _The Urantia Book_, you'd be impressed with his scholar's touch. Along with that, or more likely even before it, you would have been moved by his warmth and love, the touch of his friendship. His was a gentle strength, enhanced by a wonderful sense of humor.

To study the big blue book with Mario was to engage a personality who took great joy in its message. It is no exaggeration to say that he would read and discuss the book with fellow readers with laughter and an intellect motivated by childlike faith in God. He was able to see humor as well as profound truth in the book's depiction of the grand universe or in some feature of our planetary history. He was completely respectful of truth yet relaxed in study.

Mario would add to our study his understanding of humanity and its diverse cultures, which he gained through years of working for the United Nations. He had witnessed human tragedy with clear eyes tempered with great faith.

He appreciated the monumentality of _The Urantia Book_. He often said that it was truly a privilege to be aware of the book and a special joy to be able to study it with others.

It was a rich experience to have known him and it will be glorious to renew our friendship in the Mansions on High.
