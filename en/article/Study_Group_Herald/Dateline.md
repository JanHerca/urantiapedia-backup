## First Orders Received for Fellowship's Urantia Book

Since early January readers have responded to the announcement of the publication of _The Urantia Book_ by the Fellowship by placing 5,500 orders — more than 1,000 books by individuals and 4,500 copies by large-quantity purchasers. Published by Uversa Press, this book features a two-column format and incorporates a reference system to locate passages of the text by citing paper, section and paragraph. Notation is also provided to allow easy cross reference to the pagination of the 1955 public domain printing of _The Urantia Book_.

The book will be soft covered, 6 &frac12; inches by 9 &frac14; inches, containing approximately 1,900 pages. Two different cover designs will be produced. One cover is intended to appeal to bookstore browsers, with images of an angel, the planet Earth, and Jesus. The second is more conservative, with text only on the cover.

This edition reproduces the 1955 public domain text of _The Urantia Book_, except for the correction of spelling and typographic errors. These corrections are documented in a separate pamphlet, which is available from the Fellowship on request.

## Special Projects Puts Fellowship on the Internet

The Fellowship now has an Internet site at http://www.ubfellowship.org. The purposes of this site are to present _The Urantia Book_ to interested persons who may be searching the Internet and to develop a central location for reader services and resources, such as libraries, archives, and news related to conferences, societies and study groups. Currently the site contains a news page of IC '96. News related to the conference, as well as conference schedules and events, will be posted as they are received.

Other plans for the site include the publication of web pages for societies and study groups as they develop the ability to prepare and maintain electronic documents. An electronic response form is provided at the site so that questions and comments can be sent to a central location and then distributed via E-mail to individuals who can personally respond. This effort is being managed by Larry Watkins in Sacramento, lwatkins@bidnet.com.

More information on this site will be provided at IC ' 96 , where a computer lab will demonstrate many of the communications potentials of this rapidly growing medium.

For more information, contact Special Projects chairman David Kantor at dkantor@ubfellowship.org.

## Gender Series Now Available

A series of presentations made at the third Wrightwood Seminar on Gender and _The Urantia Book_ is now available from the Fellowship. This publication explores one of the most provocative issues of our time - the meaning of gender differences.

A small group of students shared their differing points of view in May 1993 on this intriguing subject. The five essays are the fruit of over two years of reflective, comparative review and revision. The result is a 95 -page combbound book (_see page 15 for order form_) that promises not to disappoint. Here, in brief, is what the authors say about their articles.

“Historical, Contemporary and Potential Roles for Women” by Alison Gardner. _The Urantia Book_ is a profeminist document, Gardner says. Special treatment of women and chivalry are traditions the book supports. “Jesus' gospel incorporates the greatest redefinition of a woman's rights, roles and responsibilities ever made, before or since,” she says. In her paper, Gardner shows that there is a spiritual and social quest to grant women importance and value in the planetary culture of the future.

“Spheres and Rights: A Study of _The Urantia Book_ on Gender Differences” by Byron Belitsos. This paper explores the book's disclosure that gender differences are an essential, irrefutable, and deeply meaningful feature of human life. Belitsos seeks to untangle gender mysteries and paradoxes in evolutionary thought. Key is that gender differentiation and complementarity reveal a creator design of spheres of existence which are assigned to men and women in which each reigns supreme.

“The Future of Patriarchy: Gender Bias in _The Urantia Book_ and New Paradigms of Reality” by Jeanne Melchior. Unlike Gardner, Melchior believes the book is gender biased. “Many of us feel excluded rather than invited by the predominantly male symbolism of God in _The Urantia Book_,” she says.

“Functional Gender Designation in _The Urantia Book_” by Stuart Kerr. This illustrated essay seeks to explain why apparent gender-biased language is used. “A new revelation is always contaminated by older evolutionary techniques,” Kerr says. He then analyzes gender characteristics found at various levels of personality - Deity, angel, midwayer and mortal. Kerr notes that mother love is not an acquirement, but rather an inherent endowment bestowed by the Universe Mother Spirit.

“The Complementary Natures and Potentials of Men and Women in Partnership” by Claudia Ayers and Larry Watkins. The central message of this essay is the potential for a partnership of the sexes based on teamwork. Men and women think and communicate differently, they write. Each viewpoint and inherent difference has value and must not be pushed aside in the goal of obtaining equal rights for women.
