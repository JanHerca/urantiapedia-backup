I am interested in establishing contacts with other readers, and I was wondering if there is any way to get the addresses of readers around the world. It would be nice if The Herald could link people for personal and intellectual interaction. This would strengthen and catalyze the growth of this spiritual fellowship.

It is a marvel to imagine the combined efforts of those who worked on our December international visit-at-home, with its accent on the young people who are seldom center-staged in serious gettogethers.

All of the articles were a delight and comfort, making the August 1993 edition of aging on Urantia well-timed. This issue is well worth re-reading.

If only I could write thingsclearly and well and there wasn't the necessity of cleaning a house too big for two people ... just after the wood stove has been closed for the season (so cozy, but oh so grime-engendering).

It would be a nice alternative to express the senior glory of enjoying the ability to really understand the past 77 years ... reasons behind motives ... with compassion unavailable up to this time of maturity and when peers in their 80s and 90s hint that's only a beginning. How can one help but be left on a rough seat of discomfort sitting on the fence of reality, whether 'tis better to welcome transition as soon as possible or to value with wisdom every Urantia moment?

I understand that there are some who feel that the language of _The Urantia Book_ is sexist. I can't imagine improving the beautiful way the book is written. The words are very carefully chosen.

Language, of course, is continually changing. The language at the time of the writing of _The Urantia Book_ is different from the idiom of the present day. An example is the word “man.” Its primary definition, until recently, was “an adult human being.” A current dictionary gives as the primary meaning “an adult male human being.” My dictionary even gives a footnote on why this change has come to be. Some people feel that the old way was derogatory, suggested predominance and there was too much room for confusion.

Perhaps this change in our language is just a temporary trend, which would be just fine with me. Not all of us feel that it is sexist to refer to humans as “men.” Not all of us feel that it can't be understood. To me it just flows better to say man rather than man/woman. All of those slashes — he/she, men/women, brothers/sisters — are constantly reminding us of gender. I think less emphasis would be better. In any case, I and most English-speaking people are going along with the changes in our language, especially since some of the changes have been made officially.

The problem goes beyond language. Some people have much anger about the changes which are still needed. Remember, both men and women are making great strides in this regard and anger can't help the situation.

Whatever turns our language takes, _The Urantia Book_ is not sexist. It is written in the language of the time, just as Jesus spoke on earth in the language of his time. Perhaps it sounds better in another language, but to me it sounds true, good and beautiful that God is our Father and all men are brothers.

Thank you (Mark Kulieke) for taking the time to compile all the facts and for sorting your memory in writing Birth of $a$ Revelation. There are those of us in the general population who have a high level of curiosity about the mysteries of life and the details of which you speak in your booklet. It is thrilling to go back in time through your words and glimpse the early days.

It was also thrilling to read about your Childhood Days at the Forum in the August '93 issue of The Herald. The Pine Lodge at Beverly Shores sounds like a magical place, with the Forum members there and, I'm sure, many unseen friends in attendance.

You did mention your feeling odd and different at those gatherings and that you felt you were among a special group of people and blessed to be part of this fledgling project. Mark, I often still feel that way at Urantia gatherings. It may not be original or unique, but the feeling is similar and I'm convinced many of us are blessed with this feeling.

I am now living in Starkville, Mississippi and need to know about study groups in this area.

Thank you and keep up the important work of putting out this magazine. It takes the place of David Zebedee's Messenger Corps.

In the August 1993 issue I especially liked Mark Kulieke's article on his childhood days at the Forum. Also, the piece by Jean Ramsay was good. Thanks for the great piece on Florida readers.

I'm interested in corresponding with Urantia Book readers who are interested in discussing Paper 49, The Inhabited Worlds, with particular emphasis on part 3, Worlds of the Non-Breathers.

We are told that there are three inhabitable worlds in our solar system and that a planet of the non-breather order exists in “close proximity” to Urantia. We are also told on page 330 that the revelators withhold information in order to provide a “stimulus to creative speculation.”

I am interested in speculating creatively on the subject of the other two inhabitable worlds of our local system using all available scientific and astronomical information.

It's been my experience that very few readers are at all interested in this paper. I contend, however, that if it weren't important, the Revelators wouldn't have included it.

Is anybody out there as fascinated by - this paper as I am? I'd like to hear from you. Please write.
