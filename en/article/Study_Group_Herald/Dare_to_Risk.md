To laugh is to risk appearing 
the fool.

To weep is to risk 
appearing sentimental. 
To reach for another is 
to risk involvement. 
To explore your ideas, 
your dreams, 
before a crowd 
is to risk their loss.

To love is to risk 
not being loved in return. 
To live is to risk dying. 
To believe is to risk failure.

But, risks must be taken, 
because
the greatest hazard in life 
is to risk nothing.
The people who risk nothing, 
do nothing,
have nothing, are nothing.
They may avoid suffering, 
and sorrow, but
they cannot learn, feel change, 
grow, love, live.
Chained by their altitudes, 
they are slaves;
they have forfeited their freedom. 
Only a person who risks is free.
