Dear Urantia Book Reader,

The Fellowship is preparing the new 1997 Study Group Directory. This international listing of study groups is distributed at expos, shows, fairs, and upon request to new readers. An accurate, attractive and current Directory is the best way to encourage readers to try out a study group. It is also a valuable resource for anyone traveling who would enjoy meeting other readers.

The Fellowship supports all groups that study _The Urantia Book_ and invites participation in the Directory which includes names, phone numbers, and addresses (if it is the host's wish to include the address). Study groups vary widely in their approach and some groups incorporate other interests. The focus of our service is to provide a resource for readers of _The Urantia Book_ and we therefore omit listing other activities.

Without further ado-there's good news and bad news:

## Good News

- More Urantia Books are being purchased than ever before.
- Study groups are expanding and new ones are forming to meet the growing need.
- The 1997 Study Group Directory is currently in the works. An accurate Directory continues to be an important outreach tool.
- A new section in the Directory will list individuals willing to host a study group. This will let people know about each other.
- This is the ONLY letter you will receive requesting assistance with the 1997 Directory.

## Bad News

- If you host a study group or are willing to host a study group you are being asked to fill out a form.

## Information

- WHO: Only the host is asked to complete the form for existing groups or the individual willing to host a group is asked to complete the form “Want to Host a Study Group”. All others receiving this letter should pass the information on to the host. If your group doesn't have a host, please have your members select one person to serve as host or the contact person. We don't want to miss anyone, yet we are trying to avoid duplications.
- WHEN: We would sincerely appreciate all. USA responses by April 1st and International responses by April 18th

Thank you so much for helping to make the 1997 Study Group Directory a success.

In God's Love and Service,

Mary Ebben for the Domestic Extension Committee of the Fellowship
