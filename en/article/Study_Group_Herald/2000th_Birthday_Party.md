## Seekers Study Group, Chile

The bimillennial celebration in Chile consisted of an all-night vigil. It was held at the beautiful home of Humberto Andrade in Santiago, beginning early in the evening of August 20, 1994, as noontime in Bethlehem would bring in the new Millenium at 6 a.m. Sunday morning, Santiago time. Throughout the evening, a blue candle burned to commemorate Michael, and fellowship, food, and study filled the hours until dawn broke. At 6 a.m. the Chilean readership joined together for a joyous communion. After breakfast, friends in the U.S. were called, and messages went back and forth the next day, as a reminder of new and unique ties uniting us - a conscious realization of our true and deepening relation to one another through the mind and spirit of Michael, and through the continuing birth of his truth on the bestowal world that we share.

## Northwest Colorado

On the weekend of August 21, 1994, _Urantia Book_ readers gathered in the mountains of Northwest Colorado for a campout/birthday party. We enjoyed worship and fellowship under the whispering pine trees and sparkling stars to wish our beloved Jesus a most heartfelt Happy 2,000th Birthday.

Passages from _The Urantia Book_ were read as the evening worship service began, and we honored the Spirit of Truth with a remembrance supper. Then we shared a birthday cake with big, blue concentric circles on the frosting and wished Michael a very happy birthday.

As the sun made its way behind the Continental Divide and the stars began to twinkle, we gathered around the big campfire and sang Christmas carols and other festive songs. The younger children were tucked into their sleeping bags and most of the adults gathered around the campfire as the night grew chilly and waited for the designated hour — 2 a.m. — when we would wish Jesus a Happy Birthday at the exact time of 12 noon in Israel, where nearly 100 _Urantia Book_ readers gathered at Shepherd's Field. It was a wonderful worship, each of us silently and in unison joining our hearts with so many of our brothers and sisters around the world. With the stars as a canopy, we felt the reality of our global family.

We gathered a last time for lunch, and then began our journey down the mountain to our homes, inspired to serving God even more earnestly in the new millenium.

## California

Our celebration was twofold, literally. The Northern California group went to the Shenoa Retreat Center near Booneville, east of Mendocino; the Central California group to the beach near Santa Cruz.

Some of the group arrived at the Shenoa Retreat Center the day before our celebration of the Master's birthday, on Saturday. It was a full-moon night and the sky was crystal clear. Our meditation and remembrance supper were deeply meaningful.

Shenoa was organized on the old campgrounds of Girl Scout property, rustic but comfortable. The Shenoa crew and leadership have had experience with Findhorn, the amazing Scottish center for spiritual life. As with all Findhorn-based retreat centers, there is a wonderful organic garden. Strolling about the grounds under the full moon was a treat for everyone.

On Sunday morning, we celebrated with a full service of fellowship and worship. The services were held in an open assembly tent. Inside the tent were a series of bright banners with spiritual sayings created by Pat Fearey. The central banner blazed, “As Jesus is to us, so may we be unto each other.”

Our friends in Santa Cruz report that their gathering was also special, with the sea and the redwoods and lots of meaningful interaction.

## Pilot Light Society of Seattle

We enjoyed a wonderful celebration of Michael's 2,000th anniversary in a retreat at Camp Brotherhood near Mt. Vernon, Washington. In keeping with our formula of balancing worship, study, and play, we offered a variety of workshops, recreational activities of swimming, hiking, volleyball, and basketball, and daily children's programs. One person brought a telescope for stargazing. The worldwide unity celebration took place at 1 a.m. in a large meadow with a dramatic appearance of the clouds opening up and moonlight bathing the worshipers just as the hour struck.

## Alaska

Close to 40 _Urantia Book_ readers met in Willow for a remembrance supper and potluck picnic. It had been many years since everyone from around the state had gathered, and Jesus' birthday was the perfect occasion to bring old friends together and meet new ones.

Willow is a small community two hours north of Anchorage. Dedicated readers traveled from as far away as Homer, eight hours, and Fairbanks, five hours, to attend. The group from Anchorage rented a van for the day, to journey together. As everyone arrived the food was unpacked and laid out over several picnic tables, and the feast and visiting began. The kids were very happy to be out in the country and kept a close eye on the big birthday cake for Christ Michael.

Soon it was time for the remembrance supper. A large circle was formed with the chairs and everyone held hands and prayed. Then we read selected excerpts from “Establishing the Remembrance Supper” in _The Urantia Book_ while the bread and wine were passed around. As people sipped their wine, some spoke of their feelings for Jesus and recalled how his life had impacted theirs.

## Kansas City

Approximately 78 people from many areas of Missouri and Kansas were present and took part in a remembrance service in which bread and grapes served as the te symbols of communion. Many made personal presentations relating to their feelings and thoughts on this special day. The birthday celebration was from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. with a special silent meditation at noon. A beautiful white birthday cake adorned with flowers was shared by all. A giant birthday card was signed by everybody and personal messages to Jesus were added. After lunch all members went outside and on that lovely sunny day each person released a balloon. The bright sky looked quite festive with all those blue and white colors floating heavenward. Each balloon was to represent a personal commitment to service by the individual. Everyone enjoyed wishing Michael a very Happy Birthday.

## First Society Celebration

Included among the many celebrations around the world of the 2,000 th anniversary of the birth of Michael of Nebadon in human form was a continuation of the longest series of observances of Michael's incarnation on Urantia. First Society celebrated at its home for special events, Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

Since the 1920 s, when study groups formed by Dr. William S. Sadler first observed this tradition in his home on the north side of Chicago, a group has continued to meet for this purpose. That study group became the Forum, and Dr. Sadler's home at 533 Diversey Parkway became the headquarters for the Urantia movment. It remains the headquarters for Urantia Foundation. When Urantia Brotherhood was formed in 1956, the Forum became First Urantia Society, which then became First Society in 1989, when the Brotherhood became the Fellowship.

At that time, the celebrations of Jesus' birthday moved from 533 Diversey to 529 Wrightwood. This year was the first to move outside of headquarters and outside the city of Chicago, to the site of First Society's seminars and local conferences. Nevertheless, the group can claim an unbroken tradition of 60 years of celebrations of the birth of Jesus.

This year's event was organized by Carolyn Kendall. It included a potluck supper and a rendition of Henry van Dyke's “The Other Wise Man,” by Lynne Kulieke. The main program featured dramatized readings from events throughout Jesus' life, involving the participation of many of the nearly 30 attendees. Wind music and a candlelit atmosphere helped create the tone for this event, which ended, naturally, with a birthday cake.

The gathering kicked off First Society's year-long observance of “A Year of Jesus,” with several special events in tribute to the Master's arrival on Urantia.
