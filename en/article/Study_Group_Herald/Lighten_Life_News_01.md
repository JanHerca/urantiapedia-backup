## Lumpy universe

Toronto Star Jan.31/91

LONDON (Special) -

Astronomers are groping in the dark after the revelation that all their best ideas about the structure of the universe and the creation of the galaxies are deeply flawed.

A comprehensive survey of the cosmos has revealed it is too lumpy and uneven for existing theory to make sense.

A group of astronomers from Britain and Canada has mapped more than 2,000 galaxies, out to a distance of some 450 million light years, to produce the first chart of our “local area of the universe.”

The results, published in today's issue of the scientific journal Nature, mean none of the present models of galaxy formation can explain the existence and distribution of large star clusters and intervening voids.

Cosmologists have difficulty understanding how the universe could have got so lumpy as to produce the clusters of galaxies.

## European pact spells early doom for 20,000 tanks

Toronto Star, Nov. 20 / 90

PARIS (Stafi) - For 20,000 tanks in Europe, it's the eve of destruction.

They're being blown up, bashed with steel balls, sliced to pieces, filled with concrete, turned into fire trucks or retire: to museums.

The details of destruction are explliat Europ terms of the Conventional Forch it Europe agreement.

It was signed yestend $y$ by formar adversaries, the North Atlantic Treaty Organimation nations and those of the Warsaw Pact.

The Soviets, under the terms of the agreement, have to rid themselves of 16,500 tanks, 17,000 armored vehicles 15,000 pleces of erthlory, 8,000 combet aircraft and 1,450 helicoptets.

The Americans are giving up 3,600 tanks, 100 armored vehicles and 235 helicopters.

To demolish the tanks accordifing to the rules of the pact, a steel ball must be dropped on them until their hulls are cracked in at least three places and the turrets are cracked once.

Explosives are only good if the gun mount is ruptured.

The agreement says only eight tanks can be put in a museum. It also lays out 14 roles for obsolete tanks, including their use as bulldozers, cranes, fire trucks, rescue vehicles, vehicles for cleaning oil spills and all-purpose transportation.

## Spending on global arms reported down

Chicago Tribune, November 18, 1990

WASHINGTON (AP)-For the first time in a decade, the nations of the world are spending less on weapons, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports. Among them is the Soviet Union.

Developing nations accounted for most of the decline, spending $ 25.1 billion less in 1988 than the year before. The overall drop was $ 36 billion.

Even so, spending on arms surpassed \$1 trillion for the second year in a row. Military spending in developing countries has been dropping since 1984.

The $ 11 billion decline among wealthier nations is the first drop in a decade.

The Soviet Union spent $ 299.8 billion on arms in 1988, a drop of 4 percent.

The U.S. led the world with $ 307.7 billion, showing a slight increase over 1987.

## cosmos keeps being reborn

THE TORONTO STAB

March 3, 1991

Suppose, sometime in the future, the expanding universe stopped expanding and began contracting until it eventually collapsed on itself in a big crunch, the reverse of the Big Bang. Could the force of the implosion create another Big. Bang - a new universe born from the ashes of the old? If so, was our universe created from the collapse of a previous universe?

This is the old oscillating universe theory, popular among cosmologists a few decades ago, but relegated to the theoretical trash can in recent years. Now the oscillating universe idea has been tevived by University of Alberta astrophysicist Werner Israel.

The birth of a new universe from the death of the old one is the most ancient of all cosmologies. References to the concept in Chinese and Indian writings date back at least $3,0.00$ years. Says Israel: “The idea of cycles of birth, death and rebirth are embedded in the subconscious of all human beings.” But it will be hard to prove whether reality parallels these deep-rooted musings about the universe.

## new planet 

July 25 / 91

WASHINGTON - The search for planets beyond our solar system has turned up a bizarre new candidate about 10 times the mass of Earth.

The planet, if it exists, is in orbit around a pulsing dead and dark star some 30,000 light years from Earth. A team led by British astrono. mer Andrew Lyne announced the discovery in today's issue of the journal Nature.

If independent observers confirm the finding, the planet will win a place in history as the first ever discovered around a star other than the sun. It could also upset mainstream theories about how dead stars get that way and abut their life after “death.”

“This could be the Picasso of stars — having a 'family' very late in life,” said David Black, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.

## Newsweek June 3 / 91

Unsolved mysteries: The instruments of the 1990s are intended to solve cosmic puzzles left over from the 1980s. In that decade, a burst of discoveries radically changed our notions of the universe. Infrared and optical telescopes in orbit and on the ground found galaxies arrayed in a complex, structured way-what astrophysicist Alan Dressler of the CarnegieInstitution'sobservatories in Pasadena, Calif., sees as “more like sculpture than spatter.” The galaxies sparkle like glitter on soap bubbles: galaxy upon brilliant galaxy lie on thin, curving sheets surrounding immense voids. This finding challenged the dogma that the universe is homogeneous, without structure. What wasn't explainable was simply humbling. X-ray detectors gathered evidence that humongous radiation-spewing beasts lurk in the centers of violent galaxies and left theorists scrambling to find a power source that could explain them. Optical observations of stars in galaxies implied that some 90 percent of the matter in the universe is zipping around totally undetected by any instrument, let alone the human eye. Somewhere out there is a shadow of

It's been less than 70 years since astronomers discovered that galaxies are not bright clouds in our Milky Way, but island worlds scattered through the cosmos. Having yielded one of her celestial mysteries, nature has managed to stay well ahead of scientists' pursuit of her other ones. In the 1990 s, some of the enigmas may finally yield. Yet even as the next generation of telescopes explores the art and architecture of the cosmos, astronomers will inevitably, and serendipitously, stumble upon yet deeper secrets. Vera Rubin is convinced that “some of the most mysterious features of the universe have yet to be discovered.”

## Who is God?

We asked that straightforward question, that people everywhere hold in their hearts vivid impressions of the Supreme Being, that these visions reveal the grandest extent of the human imagination and show us as much about ourselves as about the ultimate reality

## new age of prosperity

Sir John Templeton, eminence grise of the investment industry, says we're about to enter a global Golden Age.

The collapse of communism and the explosion of scientific discoveries leading to new products and processes will overshadow economic problems, soaring government debts and precarious financial markets. And, Templeton believes — as usual — the stock market will be one of the beneficiaries.

“We are coming into the most wonderful period in world history for gains in our standard of living,” the soft-spoken, 78-year-old Templeton told The Star in an interview yesterday. "Goods will be higher quality and lower cost. We will have have more variety and more new conveniences. The whole development process is speeding up.

## New Data Jolt Big Bang Theory

Jan.3/91 N.Y. Times

A critical element of the widely accepted Big Bang theory about the origin and evolution of the universe is being discarded by some of its staunch. est advocates, throwing the field of cosmology into turmoil.

According to the Big Bang theory, matter from the explosive moment of cosmic creation originally was evenly spread throughout the universe. But galaxies tend to be clumped together, an awkward fact that astronomers have sought to explain by assuming that cold invisible matter is a major attractive force.

The cold dark matter model, as it is called, accounts well for local clustering but could not explain the giant superstructures recently found in galactic surveys, like the “great wall,” a string of galaxies that stretches across the sky for at least a half billion lightyears.
