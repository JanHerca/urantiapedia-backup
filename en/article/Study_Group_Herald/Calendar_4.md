Songs For The Spiritual Renaissance

We need your help. We are in the process of compiling songs for a songbook for readers of _The Urantia Book_, and we need your help in selecting appropriate songs.

A group of readers has already begun the process of compiling songs which are favorites of Urantia Book readers around the world. If you have favorite songs that have a spiritual theme and can be sung by groups of people, please let us know the title, the author and the publisher, if possible. We will take care of the rest.

This songbook will be published by Highreach Press and will be available through Jesusonian in about a year. Please help us by sending your favorite songs.

For information on the project, please contact us at either address:

> “Of God, the most inescapable of all presences, the most real of all facts, the most living of all truths, the most loving of all friends, and the most divine of all values, we have the right to be the most certain of all universe experiences.” _The Urantia Book_ <a id="a86_266"></a>[UB 102:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_10)

> “If you truly desire to find God, you cannot help having born in your minds the consciousness of the Supreme: As God is your divine Father, so is the Supreme your divine Mother, in whom you are nurtured throughout your lives as universe creatures. ‘How universal is the Supreme; he is on all sides! The limitless things of creation depend on his presence for life, and none are refused.’” _The Urantia Book_ <a id="a88_410"></a>[UB 117:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_2)
