> ED. NOTE: _This 1992 Calendar of Events is published in retrospect in anticipation of the repeat of many of these functions in 1993. As we develop the network of communication required, we will publish the calendar in advance of the year's events. Summer events in 1993 will be subject to changes due to the scheduling of the International Conference '93 slated for July 31-August 5, in StHyacinthe, Quebec._
