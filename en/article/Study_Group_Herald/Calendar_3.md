“... choosing to do the will of God joins spiritual faith to material decisions in personality action and thus supplies a divine and spiritual fulcrum for the more effective functioning of the human and material leverage of God-hunger.” (<a id="a47_238"></a>[UB 110:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_17))

## The Decision

By W. H. Murray (from The Scottish Himalayan Expedition)

Until one is committed
there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, 
always ineffectiveness.

Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), 
there is one elementary truth, 
the ignorance of which kills countless ideas 
and splendid plans:

That the moment one definitely commits oneself, 
then Providence moves, too.

All sorts of things occur to help one
that would never otherwise have occurred.
A whole stream of events issues from the decision, 
raising in one's favor all manner
of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, 
which no man could have dreamt would have come his way.

I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:
“Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.”
