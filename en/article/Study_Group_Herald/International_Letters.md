Dear Readers,

I've been back in Zambia from the United States of America for nearly 10 years. Before I left, I enjoyed the fellowship of many _Urantia Book_ readers. Since my return, I've tried to share the book with people and l've placed one book in my local library in hopes of gaining fellow readers.

Though I still have not managed a study group, I have three books which I use as loan copies to those who are interested. The major problem that I face is to supply books to those who are serious readers and wish to have their own books. I've written to the International Fellowship Committee to assist me with this issue.

Peace is elusive in the world today and people need the good news — the gospel of Jesus — to set them free. We need to know the special life circumstances that your countries are facing or what you as individuals are going through.

It has become more difficult to get responses from readers around the world and I want to take this opportunity to appeal to all those who may read this letter to please write to me. We would love to hear from you and to know what you are doing to promote the Gospel of Jesus. We would love to share your joys and sorrows. Let us keep in touch and encourage one another in the building of this kingdom.

Zambia today is enjoying the freedom brought about by the new Third Republic, claiming to bring democracy back to the people. To those of us who have read _The Urantia Book_, this falls short of Jesus' ideal government, which is more, much more. We have Christians in the government, but you and I may debate over the term for ages. We need to know who is a true Christian in light of the gospel of Jesus.

I have faith in the work of the ministering spirits of the Infinite Spirit, and I know that when all is said and done, “all things work for good to those who love the Lord” ([Romans 8:28](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v28)). But the process of going through this life is still very challenging for those who truly love God. There is so much to be done. The harvest is plenty, yet the laborers so few.

I hope some day Zambia will host a group of Urantia Book readers from other countries. You know how you wish you could see it in your lifetime. But what does it matter, as long as it happens. One must just do the best today and leave the consequences of tomorrow to the Infinite Father.

Dear Chilufya,

Many thanks for your letter. It is gratifying to know that someone somewhere is thinking lovingly of you without being aware of such waves of thought. That was the kind of gratitude I felt at the time I received your letter.

Our study group, the Living Flame Fraternity, is alive and active. We are holding our Saturday meetings regularly. During IC'93, two of our members decided to attend. One of them, however, lost his wife only 10 days after giving birth to a baby boy. This sad event caused both of them to cancel the trip. We were hoping to get firsthand information and pictures from the Conference Centre, but that sad event deprived our group of the expected joy of receiving this news from the Centre in Canada. God willing, I will attend the next conference in 1996.

An unfortunate aspect of our study group is that it is not growing in number. We have maintained an average number of between eight and 10 for five years. The highest we have hit during this period was 12 . I wonder whether we're lacking something very essential. I admit that we have been talking to few individuals known to us. It is surprising why people can't make time to serve God. The only excuse by those we've contacted is that they had other engagements which coincide with our meeting time. From our point of view, we don't see any justification for this kind of excuse because if they wanted to come, they could make alternative arrangements. I don't know if you have any suggestions for us.

Dear Chilufya,

I recently received a copy of _The Study Group Herald_ and was so happy and surprised my brothers and sisters in the homeland of my ancestors are getting the spirit fed by _The Urantia Book_. I thank God.

I'm 32 and have read _The Urantia Book_ for six years now.

You are a beautiful sister, a queen. Tell me about yourself and if you have a study group in Zambia. How many people? I pray for the seeds of truth to grow in your community and country.

Dear Chilufya,

We read with interest your International Readers section of _The Study Group Herald_. We are particularly interested in the Urantia Nazareth Brotherhood in Accra, Ghana, for it was in Ghana, more than 20 years ago that we received _The Urantia Book_. Since we began our reading and study of _The Urantia Book_ in the Ghanian environment, we feel a special kinship to Ghanaians who are likewise truth seekerswho have found _The Urantia Book_.

A number of years ago, we had an extraordinary discussion with a woman from Zambia who was at the Summer Seminar at Lake Forest, Illinois, USA. She was a tremendous help in explaining the section on the races. It was a discussion that really made a difference to us. Do you know to whom I am referring? We would like to have the opportunity to tell her what a difference she has made in our understanding of that section.

Dear Readers,

I was very excited to read of the learning materials for children profiled in The Study Group Herald. This is a muchneeded service, for it is the young people of today who will pass on their understanding for tomorrow and so spread their own truth to the world. One person can make a difference in spreading the teachings.

Dear Readers,

The caravans were packed last May and again the J.J. Johnson tribe headed for the Middle East. We arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on a 747 and were greeted by Jeff Bedell. The “Riyadh Readers” were formed and a familiar group we are, having originally met in Jeddah in 1980

Our jobs have brought us back to this desert. Jeff, hired by Vinnell Corp., teaches English as a foreign language to men in the Saudi National Guard. J.J. is the Hughes Aircraft liaison to the Royal Saudi Air Force and Geri is a private therapist to an autistic child in Saudi.

Sons Michael and David are in ninth and sixth grade, respectively, at the International school, which is an American-curriculum school attended by at least 25 different nationalities. The boys' classes are well mixed with Europeans, Australians, Asians, Middle Easterners, Saudis, Christians and Moslems.

Despite our earlier experiences here, we all had to adjust to the culture again. There is much that is different to our liberal American ways. Michael and David must wear long trousers in all public places, be careful of designs on tee shirts and keep their hair relatively short. Geri is expected to wear the abaya (black cloak) and a head scarf. Women never lookmen directly in the eyes, and our boys may not show much curiosity about the young girls here. Women don't drive and optimally should be escorted in public by a male member of the family. Restaurants are divided into “Men Only” and “Family” sections. In the family area, provisions are made to screen off each table or booth for privacy. There are no movie theaters, but we can buy videotapes with all romantic scenes edited out.

There is a mosque in every neighborhood, but no other religious structure or practice is legal. Proselytizing any religion other than Islam is a serious offense, though one may worship God quietly at home.

God is included in every aspect of life. Each airport, mall, bank, school, office building, hospital and supermarket sets aside a place for prayer. All business STOPS five times a day to honor Allah. The local television stations not only announce prayer times, but broadcast the prayers from the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

In the words of a deeply spiritual Moslem friend, prayer call is the invitation to visit with Allah, to feel His love and peace. In that light, even the dawn call that pierces the early morning quiet and our deep sleep, is greeted with a smile, for the Muezzin calls out, “Come to Allah, come to Allah, prayer is better than sleep.”

Dear Fellowship,

Enclosed is my cheque for $\$ 20$ USF because I appreciate receiving the publication. Like so many others who write to you, I feel isolated and disappointed by the lack of interest in truth by the people around me. The Study Group Herald is my only link to other readers of _The Urantia Book_ and hope for a better world.

Dear Readers,

Until very recently there were very few readers of _The Urantia Book_ in Puerto Rico. This seems to be changing rapidly. Shortly after _The Urantia Book_ became available in Spanish late last summer, two important bookstores in San Juan began to carry it and many have been sold.

In the past few weeks, I have met several new readers of _The Urantia Book_, and some of them will add new blood to our study group. There is also a possibility that other groups will be formed within the next year. That's how important it is to have a Spanish translation available to us.

I discovered _The Urantia Book_ in 1976 when I was a student at Tulane University in New Orleans. Soon after that I became a member of the study group in New Orleans. Later I moved to south Florida and participated in the study groups in West Palm Beach and North Miami Beach. In 1981 I moved to Puerto Rico and have been somewhat isolated from the Urantia movement on the continent.

I want to end this note sharing with you the way we pray the Lord's prayer. If you don't understand the words, you will certainly understand their power.

“Padre Nuestro, que estas en el cielo, santificado sea tu Nombre, venga a nos Tu reino, hagase tu voluntad asi en la tierra como en el cielo. El pan nuestro de cada dia, danosle hoy. Perdona nuestras duedas asi como nosotros perdonamos a nuestros deudores. No nos dejes caer en tentacion, mas libranos del mal, porque Tuyo es el poder, el reino y la gloria por los siglos de los siglos. Amen.”
