Imagine a publication that combines the artistic beauty and intellectual refinement of _The Journal_ with the news of _The Bulletin_ and the best features of _The Study Group Herald_. That's what you have in store as you read this issue. We've merged our three prior newsletters into this, the first Fellowship magazine.

Along with this major change in the structure of our publications, you may see some other variations. Notice, for instance, our new nameplate on the cover. It was designed by Joel Avirom, the New York artist who designed the cover of The Fellowship's edition of _The Urantia Book_.

This issue also serves as our memorial observance of the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of our Creator Son, Michael of Nebadon, as the baby Jesus. We have dedicated a lot of print to Jesus, including the colorful cover. To develop our topic further, we invited an Episcopalian minister to write his views about Jesus the man as a hero. Father Kelly's cover story looks at this subject from the traditional Christian perspective with a companion piece written by a longtime Urantia Book reader. We hope this is the start of a new trend, inviting spiritual leaders of all walks of life to write on assigned topics.

Also, you'll see referenced in a couple of news stories that the first printing of _The Urantia Book_ occurred 40 years ago. We didn't want to let that historic landmark go by unnoticed.

This Fellowship magazine should be arriving in your mailbox three times a year - in the spring, autumn and at end of year. If you have anything you'd like to submit for publication, please send it to the headquarters of The Fellowship (address below). We're always searching for good photography, poetry, stories, and news. Share your talent with us and we'll give it the best treatment we can.
