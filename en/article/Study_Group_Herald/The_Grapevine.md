## Family Happenings

**Dr. Lawrence Schkade** of Fort Worth, Texas is doing well after his heart transplant and has resumed hosting a study group.

**Brent St. Denis** of Elliot Lake, Ontario has been elected to a four-year term as a member of Parliament in the Ottawa government. He is a member of the Liberal Party and represents 73,000 people in the No. Algoma district of Ontario. Regretfully, due to a lack of time to continue his volunteer efforts, Brent has had to resign his post as secretary-general of the Fellowship to pursue his career in Canadian politics.

**Duane and Lucile Faw** escaped the fires that swept Malibu, California in October. Although their home and all their belongings were destroyed by the fire, they are well and plan to rebuild.

## In Service

**Alan Smith**, a readex in Chiang Mai, Thailand and **Timothy Decker** have placed more than 100 Urantia Books throughout India and Southeast Asia.

**Robin and Helene Jorgensen** of New York City, who helped at _The Urantia Book_ booth at New York's Whole Life Expo, report of their experience, “We can in truth say we actually had a bona fide blue book ”Blue Light Special“ rush on the booth. Credit cards were flying as were our spirits. Major seeds were sown.”

## On Study Groups

**Ralph and Betty Zehr**, who host the study group in Waverly, New York, encourage members to study the topic before each session. They are focusing on the life and teachings of Jesus and papers related to the upcoming 2,000 th birthday celebration of Jesus. In their study group children sit at a nearby table where they can hear the discussion while doing artwork and other activities geared to their age.

The study group in Austin, Texas holds a special sequential reading of _The Urantia Book_, with newcomers and other seekers invited to read alongside longtime readers. **Tim and Kitty Traylor** publish a newsletter with notes and maps to homes of the various families who host the study group.

A *study group for teenagers* has been started in Boulder, Colorado. The same is happening in Indianapolis.

A **Urantia Book/Bible study group** meets in Dallas. This type of study is also taking place in Rochester and Buffalo, New York.

Another new study group has started meeting at the home of Charlie Olivea in Watertown, Connecticut. Karen Andersen, Marty Greenhut, Art Gregory and Bill Rocap study in this group, which meets on the first and third Sunday of each month from 3 to 5 p.m. Meetings alternate between sequential reading and topical study.

## Area Coordinators

The Fellowship has elected several new area coordinators. If you know readers of _The Urantia Book_ who need assistance in those regions of the United States, please refer them to their new area coordinators. They are:

## 1995 Summer Intensive

The **Education Committee** has prepared an agenda for next year's Summer Intensive program, tentatively to be held July 22-27 at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, New Jersey. The theme for the six-day event is ***Spiritual Communion — Theory & Practice***.

“The university is convenient to the Newark airport and it's a place where there are a lot of readers,” says **Dan Massey**, chairman of the committee.

As to why the program is not meeting at Lake Forest, Illinois, “we intend to move it to places where there can be local society participation,” Massey says.
