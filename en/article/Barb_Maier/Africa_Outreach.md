Many Ugandan pastors and citizens are receiving and excited about the teachings of the Urantia Book's presentation of the gospel of Jesus.

They are organizing study groups, giving presentations to pastors and sponsoring a conference in August of 2021.

With assistance from the International Fellowship Committee (IFC) members Paul and Monica Kemp, and Soren Vestergaard, we are building a core group of leaders and teachers. We, on the IFC, are incredibly excited as we see relationships developing, faith expanding, and people creating groups on their own and much more.
