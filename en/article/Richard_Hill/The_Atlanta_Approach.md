## Introductory Study Group

Our introductory group is open to anyone wishing to discuss _The URANTIA Book_. We will give some basic insights into the contents of the book and be more than happy to answer any questions. This session is designed to provide an opportunity for new or potential readers to meet other URANTIA Book readers, and ask questions in an informal environment.

## Regular Study Group

Anyone is invited to attend a meeting of the regular URANTIA Book study group. However, it is requested that all who attend be aware of the purpose of this group as opposed to the beginning or introductory group, and the Work Group (below). The regular group is concerned with in-depth study of _The URANTIA Book_ papers. Usually this group has a particular paper planned for discussion each night. This group flows smoothly when all those participating in the discussion are somewhat familiar with the book as a whole. It is requested of those who are interested in attending this group that they take it upon themselves to become familiar with the current topic (paper) by (1) seeking to satisfy all general questions by raising them at an introductory group meeting: (2) becoming familiar with _The URANTIA Book_ by reading a good portion of it; and, (3) reading completely the paper to be discussed before the regular study group meeting.

## Work Group

The work group is made up of people performing free social service for those in need of physical help. Our approach is not one of witnessing or even announcing our common bond. The work group is simply people helping people. We have several options of service if you feel compelled to help your fellow man. Some of us work at these projects on Saturday; however, other days of service can be provided.
