_By Flor Robles, Santiago, Chile_

This is a thank you note from Chile for the great experience we had sharing the teachings of the fifth epochal revelation during the seventeen day 2012 international book fair in Santiago, Chile.

This is a thank you note from Chile for having Urantia Foundation, Urantia Association International, and the Urantia Book Fellowship make this project a reality.

This is a thank you note from Chile to readers of _The Urantia Book_ who participated: Agustin Arellano from Mexico; Nélida Oliver from Ecuador; Buck Weimer, Tim Hobbs, Joy Brandt, Janelle Mazza, and Linda Tarufeli from the United States; and Lissette Mancilla, Marcelo Galaz, Jon DeToy, Daniel Espinoza, Pradhana Fuchs, and Pablo Segóvia from Chile. We all worked together to set up the booth, to roll spiritual vitamins, and to give away different brochures, pamphlets, and other gifts. We answered questions and gave our time, love, and service to everyone who visited the booth.

There were two conferences on the last day. An experienced Chilean reader, Yolanda Silva, came to the last conference and spoke about _The Urantia Book_ and answered questions.

This is a thank you note from Chile for the new readers and the energy generated by the book fair. We have fresh inspiration to work harder at spreading the teachings of the fifth epochal revelation in this beautiful country. Our goals for 2013 include the formation of new study groups, the planning for conferences and workshops, and the placement of _The Urantia Book_ in libraries in Santiago and other communities.

We have a great team, and we have passion to work for our Father by sharing the most beautiful teachings about his creation, about the origin and destiny of planets and mortals, and about our beloved sovereign, Michael of Nebadon, and his mortal life on Urantia as Jesus of Nazareth.

Finally, this is a thank you note from Chile to our Father for giving us the opportunity to contribute, from this part of the world, towards moving our planet closer to the future stage of light and life.
