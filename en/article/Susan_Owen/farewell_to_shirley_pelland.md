Shirley Pelland graduated from her life on Urantia Friday February 21, 2015. Shirley is a long time and devoted student of _The Urantia Book_ and beloved member of the Urantia community. Her wonderful vibrancy, energy, love and caring touched so many.

Shirley was a member of the First Urantia Society of Los Angeles and a charter member of the Southwest Urantia Reader Family (SURF) where she served as an officer for many years while living in Southern California. She also served as the first Secretary of the International Service Board of the International Urantia Association from 2003 – 2007. She later moved to Ocean View on the ‘big’ island of Hawaii to be closer to her family and there she served for many years as an officer of Hawaii Urantia Local Association (HULA).

Shirley cared deeply for this planet and was a true lover of life and adventure. She was a real Southern California surfer girl and an avid skydiver. The picture on the right shows a few of Shirley’s friends who joined her to celebrate her 50th birthday with a three concentric circle flight. That’s Shirley in the middle circle on the right side in the yellow helmet. And I am sure that many of those flight suits were designed and sewn by Shirley.

Although Shirley left Urantia all too early and she will be sorely missed by many, her soul has been released for the next adventure and there will be smiles all around when we meet again on the mansion worlds. Fly high Shirley. See you soon.
