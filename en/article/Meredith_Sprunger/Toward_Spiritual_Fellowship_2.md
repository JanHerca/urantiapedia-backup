One of the most distinctive contemporary developments of religion in our world is the advent of the ecumenical movement and the unprecedented search for meaningful spiritual experience. This expanding quest for spiritual guidance and direction has taken many forms. The theologian, Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923), observed that all religions are relative-that is limited, partial, and incomplete. The historian, Arnold Toynbee (1889-1975), examined all of the religions of the world and pointed out that there is a common core and goal behind all religions. The psychiatrist, Carl G. Jung (1875-1961), in an in depth study of religions found that there is a common psychic origin and function among religions. These and other scholarly studies of religion set the stage for the contemporary ecumenical movement.

Paul F. Knitter's book, _No Other Name? A Critical Survey of Christian Attitudes Toward the World Religions_, [^1] is one of the most insightful present day discussions of the ecumenical basis of religion. Dr. Knitter reminds us that Jesus established a theocentric (religion of Jesus) foundation of religion rather than a Christocentric (religion about Jesus) basis of religion. He points out that all religions could profit from the insights and experiences of other religions. The last chapter of Professor Knitter's book entitled, “The Challenge of Interreligious Dialogue,” makes an eloquent argument for the development of a ***global theology***.

Stemming from this new pluralism in theology over the past quarter century or more, Lonnie D. Kliever's book, _The Shattered Spectrum, A Survey of Contemporary Theology_, [^2] observes that the kaleidoscope of new theologies that have appeared in recent times defy classification under the old categories. Professor Kliever believes that radical changes will take place in the form and content of religion in the future: “In such crisis circumstances, the search for and conversion to a new worldview can and does occur. Such a breakthrough depends upon finding some new organizing metaphor or shared paradigm through which to re-view and re-shape the world.” (p. 197) The authors of the Urantia Papers have given us such a new spiritual paradigm that will bring a renaissance of religion on our world.

Evidence of the changing nature of religion and the searching attitude of people is seen in the Congregational Life Survey funded by the Lilly Endowment and the Louisville Institute. In April of 2001, nearly 300,000 worshipers filled out questionnaires answering questions about their church attendance and religious convictions. Nearly one quarter of them switched congregations in the past five years. Only seven percent of newcomers had no earlier involvement with a faith community which suggests that only a small number of the unchurched are looking for traditional religious affiliation. Agreat number of people are searching for a more meaningful spiritual experience. In the February, 2002 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, an article, “Oh Gods!” Toby Lester says that the new century will probably see religion explode — in both intensity and variety. New religions are springing up everywhere and old ones are transforming themselves dramatically.

## The Fullness of Time

The stage is set for the advent of a new spiritual vision that will transform our society. Our world has been prepared by:

- _The birth of the ecumenical movement._
- _A recognition that a global understanding of religion must be theocentric._
- _A proliferation of new theological approaches to spiritual experience._
- _An unprecedented searching for a more meaningful view and experience of spiritual Reality._
- _A realization that our worldneeds a “new organizing metaphor or shared paradigm that will reshape the world.”_

The Fifth Epochal Revelation, in my opinion, is the only resource that has the spiritual vision and power to fulfill these longings and aspirations of our human condition. The history of religion shows that spiritual value systems are always established by some kind of religious organization. The Spiritual Fellowship is the first religious organization designed to carry the Fifth Epochal Revelation to the indigenous communities of the world. While we must always keep in mind that God is the end and all other things are means, there is a danger in forgetting that it is the means that are instrumental in getting to the end. When using terms like “church” or “fellowship,” there is a danger of getting bogged down in semantics — a religious organization is also a brother/sisterhood. The social dynamics of a religious organization are basic in carrying the religion of Jesus to the grass roots of the world.

The worldwide mission of The Spiritual Fellowship is to teach, motivate, empower, and support all people in their growing relationship with God and to encourage their loving service to humankind. We believe that every religion of our world can identify with this mission. As we establish Fellowships in the grass roots of every nation and culture, the spiritual vision of the Fifth Epochal Revelation will gradually become known and this vision will eventually transform human society.

This outreach ministry will not be easy. It is not for timid souls. It is difficult for balanced, solid citizens to risk being viewed by their neighbors and friends as “different” or belonging to some strange cult or movement. Pioneers always face difficulty and hardship. New and enlarged presentations of truth have always been, and will always be, attacked by religious traditionalists and fundamentalists. The history of spiritual growth shows that not until an enlarged vision of truth is attacked and its pioneers persecuted does it come to the attention and make its appeal to the significant number of creative seekers for spiritual truth in society — “Happy are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (<a id="a58_759"></a>[UB 140:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_11)) Let us be numbered among those pilgrims who “have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. In liaison with God, nothing — absolutely nothing — is impossible.” (<a id="a58_1218"></a>[UB 26:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_3))
