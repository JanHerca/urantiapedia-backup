During the past 45 years there has been a difference of opinion regarding the nature of the Urantia movement. Some have regarded it as a religious movement; others have viewed it as an educational movement with a religious purpose. The official organizations-Urantia Foundation, _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, and the International Urantia Association-have all denied that they are religious organizations. They have lost much of the dynamic of outreach ministry and are instead engaged in political power struggles.

There is no group exclusively dedicated to the dissemination of the Fifth Epochal Revelation as a religious mission. While religion is fundamentally an individual experience of values, this individual experience inevitably results in social expression. This social expression is important if our world society is to evolve in an enlightened, positive direction.

The history of religion shows that spiritual value systems are always established and promoted through some kind of religious organization. When I first discovered the Urantia Papers, I thought they were ideally suited to upstep Christianity and the other religions of the world. I still believe this will eventually happen. For over 40 years I have been interfacing with the leaders of the Christian Church and this experience has made it quite clear that it will take considerable time before they will seriously examine the Urantia Papers. So after much thought and soul searching, I believe it is time, probably past time, to actualize a bona fide religious organization inspired by the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

Early this year Sherilyn Henry and I, along with around 40 other students of the Urantia Papers, started organizing a new religious organization, The Spiritual Fellowship. This organization is based upon the teachings of Jesus in the Fifth Epochal Revelation. The Spiritual Fellowship is being incorporated in the State of California. It will also be incorporated in Canada.

Currently, ten research and consulting committees have been organized to study various aspects of The Spiritual Fellowship over the next few years. The Founding Directors are Sherilyn Henry, Nancy Long, Larry Mullins, Irene Sprunger, Meredith Sprunger, and Sue Tennant. The Theological and Philosophical Principles Committee is chaired by Nancy Long; the Manual On Ministry Committee is chaired by Gregory Young; the Liturgy and Rituals Committee chair is Michael Melody; the Composition of sacred Music and Revision of Hymns Committee is chaired by Bud Bromley; the Education Committee chair is Merlyn Cox; the Evangelism Committee is chaired by Christopher Lepine; our Website Committee is chaired by Robert Hurt; the Finance and Stewardship Committee chair is Sherilyn Henry; and the Administrative and Planning Committee chair is Meredith Sprunger.

Our Mission Statement is: “The worldwide mission of The Spiritual Fellowship is to teach, motivate, empower, and support all people in their growing relationship with God and to encourage their loving service to humankind.”

Our Preamble highlights the seven most important concepts that The Spiritual Fellowship attempts to promote and live:

1. The loving Parenthood of God and the spiritual brother /sisterhood of all people are our two guiding foundational principles. We acknowledge as kindred spirits, all individuals and traditions, past and present, who recognize these two principles.
2. We rejoice that all people are God's beloved children and that, as the ultimate authority, a fragment of God's spirit indwells each person, guiding us, if we are willing, to our highest spiritual good.
3. The Spiritual Fellowship affirms that true religion is the spiritual experience of personally knowing God. We believe that the supernal quest of all people is that of discovering God, and that the path of finding and doing God's will is an individual responsibility and personal experience.
4. The Spiritual Fellowship recognizes as the spiritual ideal for human living, the life and teachings of Jesus as confirmed and expanded in _The Urantia Book_. To this end, we utilize all sacred scriptures portraying spiritual truth and wisdom harmonious with this guideline for spiritual living.
5. The Spiritual Fellowship welcomes all people into membership who recognize the parenthood of God and the spiritual kinship of all people, and who endeavor to live a God-centered life striving to give selfless, loving service to others.
6. The Spiritual Fellowship challenges each member to strive towards consistent, God-centered living and thus supports, honors, and encourages spiritual transformation and enhanced values for the individual, the family, and the community in all aspects of life: physical, social, psychological, and spiritual.
7. The Spiritual Fellowship is growth-focused. It will be in constant self-generated improvement without sacrificing its essential vision, purpose, and nature of principles.

The Industrial Age was primarily an extension of muscle-power. The Information Age is an extension of mental power. The Chaordic Age[^1] promises to be an extension of spiritual influence, insight, and transformation. We hope The Spiritual Fellowship is the beginning of a religious institution that will carry the religion of Jesus and the Fifth Epochal Revelation throughout the world.

> “It is difficult for religion to survive as the private practice of isolated individuals. This has ever been the error of the religious leaders: Seeing the evils of institutionalized religion, they seek to destroy the technique of group functioning. In place of destroying all ritual, they would do better to reform it.” <a id="a60_323"></a>[[UB 97:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p10_7)]

> “While it is true that the institutionalization of religion has usually detracted from its spiritual quality, it is also a fact that no religion has thus far succeeded in surviving without the aid of institutional organization of some degree, greater or lesser.” <a id="a62_265"></a>[[UB 98:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p6_1)]

> “Regardless of the drawbacks and handicaps, every new revelation of truth has given rise to a new cult, and even the restatement of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and appropriate symbolism.” <a id="a64_203"></a>[[UB 87:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_6)]

> “Notwithstanding that the new cult has always retarded social progress, it is regrettable that so many modern believers in moral standards and spiritual ideals have no adequate symbolismnothing to belong to.” <a id="a66_211"></a>[[UB 87:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_3)]

> “There is a real purpose in the socialization of religion. It is the purpose of group religious activities to dramatize the loyalties of religion; to magnify the lures of truth, beauty, and goodness; to foster the attractiveness of supreme values; to enhance the service of unselfish fellowship; to glorify the potentials of family life; to promote religious education; to provide wise counsel and spiritual guidance; and to encourage group worship.” <a id="a68_453"></a>[[UB 99:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_2)]

The Spiritual Fellowship is a God-centered spiritual vision striving to develop an appropriate symbolism and socioreligious expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. We invite you to participate in this new spiritual adventure in various ways that seem appropriate for you, such as:

1. Pray that we may faithfully follow God's will and wisdom.
2. Become a Spiritual Fellowship leader in your community by encouraging your study group, friends, and associates to start a home-based fellowship.
3. Volunteer your time, creativity, and resources to this endeavor.
4. Consider formal training to become a Spiritual Fellowship ordained minister or certified teacher.

We believe The Spiritual Fellowship will carry the religion of Jesus and the Fifth Epochal Revelation throughout the world. We invite you to join this spiritual adventure into the future.

## Notes

[^1]: The Chaordic Age: When an innovative individual by the name of Dee Hock was CEO of VISA International, he introduced principles which enabled people and institutions of every conceivable language, culture, currency, race, and economic and political persuasion to unite in a commonly owned organization in which members simultaneously engaged in the most intense cooperation and fierce competition. In attempting to explain these creative principles, Hock found no word that adequately portrayed these principles, so he coined a word from chaos and orderchaord. A chaord is any self-organizing, self-governing, adaptive, nonlinear, complex organism, organization, community or system, the behavior of which harmoniously blends characteristics of both chaos and order. It is an entity whose behavior exhibits observable patterns and probabilities not governed or explained by the rules that govern or explain its constituent parts. It is characteristic of the fundamental organizing principles of evolution and nature. Many experts believe we are entering into a Chaordic Age, in which the most successful organizations will be developed according to Chaordic principles. See Dee Hock, “_Birth of the Chaordic Age._”
