A highly acclaimed book, _The Rise of Christianity_, by Rodney Stark (Princeton University Press, 1996) may cast some light on growth in the Urantia movement. Rodney Stark who teaches at the University of Washington is regarded by many scholars as the most significant figure in the sociology of religion today. From the best available data, Dr. Stark estimates that Christianity grew at the rate of 40% per decade. Professor Stark has other observations about the rise of Christianity, some of which refute traditional opinions and may lend insights on growth in the Urantia movement:

- There were no miraculous rates of conversion. Christianity grew in the normal evolutionary manner.
- New religious movements mainly draw their converts from the ranks of the religiously inactive, discontented, and secular communities. The most important influence is that of family and friends.
- Most new religious movements fail because they become closed or semi-closed networks. Successful movements discover techniques for remaining open networks.
- We have assumed that Christianity was a movement of the dispossessed; in actuality, Christianity spread first among the middle class and educated.
- Christianity was first and foremost an urban movement.
- Jews were a significant factor in the rise of Christianity. People are more willing to adopt a new religion to the extent that it retains cultural continuity and works in preexisting networks.
- Women played a major role in the growth and development of Christianity.
- The ultimate factor in the rise of Christianity was its teaching of the love of God and the love of all people that “prompted and sustained attractive, liberating, and effective social relations and organizations.” ( p. 211) This new religious paradigm inspired the behavior of the martyrs and resulted in the substantially higher rates of survival in the devastating epidemics of 165 A.D. and 251 A.D. in which a quarter to a third of the Roman Empire population died.

Starting with the estimate that there were around 300 people in the Urantia movement in 1955, a 40% per decade growth rate suggests that there should be around 1152 people in the Urantia movement in 1995. Using this criterion, it appears that we are growing as well as or better than early Christianity.

One of the potentially crippling factors in the Urantia movement is the semi-closed networks of the Fellowship and the IUA where in-group activities predominate. We lack religious organizations primarily devoted to ministry and outreach. A redeeming factor is Urantian Web Sites on the Internet. Hopefully, we are laying foundations for the advent of new religious organizations that will carry the paradigm of the Fifth Epochal Revelation throughout the world.
