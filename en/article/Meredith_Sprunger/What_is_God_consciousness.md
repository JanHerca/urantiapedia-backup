The highest objective of human life enunciated by all of the world religions in various ways is the achievement of God-consciousness and shaping one's life in harmony with God's will. This objective is also cited as the greatest achievement of human beings by _The Urantia Book_.

> The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. Man's greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spiritconsciousness — contact with the divine presence. Such an experience constitutes God-consciousness.... And God-consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the self with the universe, and on its highest levels of spiritual reality. (<a id="a38_614"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34))

But what is God-consciousness? Most people tend to think of God-consciousness in terms of an alter ego experience, hearing a voice, or an awareness of another personality presence. Such concepts, in my judgment, give a misleading picture of God's presence in our lives. The indwelling Spirit of God, the Thought Adjuster, is actually an interior aspect of mind. It is the superconscious quality of mind as opposed to the subconscious, animal heritage of mind. This fragment of God's spirit is pre-personal in nature and is experienced as a quality of consciousness. When, through our dedicated and persistent will decisions, the Spirit of God is functionally dominant in our consciousness, this superconscious influence is evidenced by certain basic characteristics:

1. We experience a deep inner peace, in spite of problems and difficulties in our lives which may appear to be severe and overwhelming.
2. Our minds resonate positively toward truth, beauty, goodness, love, and all of the fruits of the Spirit.
3. We have an urge to master our minds under the dominance and control of these spiritual values until our minds become one with these values, and in the same mastery process we negate and then eliminate negative animal, subconscious influences such as anger, fear, anxiety, doubt, and self-deprecation.
4. As we make spiritually motivated decisions and strive to master our minds with spiritual values, the immortal soul evolves. The soul functions in our consciousness as an adjunct to our spirit-dominated aspect of mind, something like a “second mind.” As spirit-values master our animal-origin mind, we live more and more in what might be called our “soul-spirit mind.”
5. We experience an inner joy which passes all human understanding. We live in the interior _Spirit Level of Mind_ whose basic characteristics are joy and fellowship with God, even as we live concomitantly in the exterior, material world that may bring us loss, defeat, or tragedy. Because this interior God-consciousness is dominant in our lives, the difficulties, problems, and losses of the material world are transcended through creative living. This joy elicits a confidence and courage that masters fear and anxiety and eventually obliterates these heritages of the subconscious animal mind.

In the cooperative partnership between the indwelling Spirit of God and the human will-mind, there evolves a growing God-consciousness, along with the development of the soul, that culminates in the oneness of the human mind and will with the will of God. At that point in time the human soul fuses with the indwelling fragment of the Spirit of God-usually on the mansion worlds of the Father's kingdom — and a new universe personality is born.
