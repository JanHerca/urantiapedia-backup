Courage and wisdom are the key actualizers of progress. Most people in critical situations exhibit a surprising amount of physical courage. Not many of us are willing to express opinions or initiate actions requiring mental and spiritual courage. It is much easier to keep quiet rather than to do anything which might trigger opposition or cause others to think less favorably of us. We feel more comfortable going along with generally accepted opinions and behavior. It is a rare individual, indeed, who has the courage to take action in the search for truth or justice which may threaten to exclude them from their in-group. 

As a retired cleric, I find it interesting to observe the mental and spiritual courage of ministers. Many of us take pride in speaking and acting boldly as long as it is within the tolerance parameters of our peers and parishioners. Occasionally we are even willing to challenge these limits — but not too far. Our reputation and livelihood are at stake.

Today in mainline theological circles it is permissible to criticize the church, to refute the doctrine of the literal inspiration of scripture, and to challenge almost any theological position. We are always careful, however, to make such criticisms within certain boundaries of the Christian community. There are still subtle, unwritten parameters at any given time within which it is intellectually respectable and spiritually permissible to read, study, write, and speak.

Thirty-five years of experience has taught me that anything purporting to be new revelation is not within the boundaries of current theological-institutional religious respectability. Over the years as I have shared _The Urantia Book_ with my peers in ministry, interest is shown until they hear that it claims to be revelatory. Then a cloud of noncommitment and fear covers the entire topic-never mind that the book may contain an unparalleled account of the life and teachings of Jesus, a breath-taking view of reality, and superior spiritual wisdom. Those ministers who do summon the courage to read and critically evaluate it, do so covertly.

Many generations from now their successors will marvel that this seminal book of spiritual enlightenment was not immediately recognized. We should not be surprised. This has been the historic reaction to epochal revelation on our world. Evolution is slow but sure. Those of us who have been blessed with this discovery can only be thankful for our good fortune.
