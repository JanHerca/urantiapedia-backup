Some of the perennial problems which men and women have in understanding each other are addressed in this issue of the Journal, including the sexist language of _The Urantia Book_ and gender appellations of deity. Recent decades have witnessed two contradictory scientific-cultural gender developments:

(1) Extensive scientific evidence indicates that men and women have different brain-mind capacities.

(2) Strong educational-political contentions denying that such differences exist.

Anne Moir and David Jessel in _Brain Sex_ point out, “There is solid and consistent evidence from scientists all over the world that a biochemical influence in the womb determines and directs the structure and function of our brains.” (p. 180) They go on to say that not until we face the fact of who we are, and our unique capacities as men and women, will we be able to build solid relations in marriage and society.

> The Urantia Book _authors harmonize these two contradictory views of gender in agreeing with scientific evidence that men and women have different view points and life reactions but maintain with the women's liberation movement that there should be social, educational, economic, and political freedom and equality of both sexes._

_The Urantia Book_ authors harmonize these two contradictory views of gender in agreeing with scientific evidence that men and women have different view points and life reactions but maintain with the women's liberation movement that there should be social, educational, economic, and political freedom and equality of both sexes. Men and women are essentially complementary: “...always will these two basic variations of humankind continue to intrigue, stimulate, encourage, and assist each other; always will they be mutually dependent on co-operation in the solution of perplexing universe problems and in the overcoming of manifold cosmic difficulties.” (<a id="a46_659"></a>[UB 84:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_6))

Hopefully, our culture will also learn to live with the fact that men and women have different mental and personality orientations and afford each sex the freedom and equality to contribute creatively to the solution of our many social problems. Such dual associations greatly increase the versatility and potential of humanity.
