Leaders of the National Council of Churches are seriously thinking about forming a new, more inclusive ecumenical organization that would include Roman Catholics, evangelicals, and Pentecostals. The thirty five denominations comprising the National Council of Churches account for only about one-third of the Christians in the United States. It is encouraging to see the “mainline” Christian Churches attempting to be more inclusive. The Editor of _The Christian Century_ wonders how this could be accomplished as the scope of theological and ideological differences in Christianity is overwhelming.

Students of _The Urantia Book_ speculate about an even larger ecumenical challenge: the fraternal relationship of all of the religions of the world. The authors of the Fifth Epochal Revelation present a universe view of reality that embraces the best insights of all religions. In the next two-thousand years our world will be challenged to achieve harmonious relationships among all of the religions of the world. At present we are having difficulty in maintaining cooperative relationships among the various factions in the Urantia movement! We are, indeed, ecumenically challenged. Hopefully, we can find ways in which to work together in the outreach of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. This is one of the most important missions facing our planet in the 21 st Century.
