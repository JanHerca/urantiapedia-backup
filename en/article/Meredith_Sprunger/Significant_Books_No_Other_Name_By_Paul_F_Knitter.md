Orbis Books, 1985, 231 pp.

Paul Knitter focuses attention on our contemporary world view which confronts us with the reality of religious pluralism. Life is rich, complex, diverse, and mysterious. Our entire universe is engaged in an evolutionary process. The physicist, David Bohm, sees that we are part of an “implicate order,” an infinitely complex and dynamic web of interrelationships. As individuals we find our identity in the context of other selves. Humanity and religion are moving toward a “unitive pluralism.” In order to be good citizens of any one nation, we have to be world citizens. To be good members of any one religion, we must belong to the brotherhood of all people. Increasingly, world citizenship is seen not only as a psychological and spiritual need, but as an economic and political imperative. Religion historically has divided people, but we are now at a point in human destiny when religion may become a unifying force. The Christian church may be on the verge of experiencing a “kairos”of self-transformation, a “third reformation,” which will make it a true world church.

Attitudes of our secular culture toward the diversity of religion can be grouped into three general classifications. First, all religions are relative; they take on the character of their historical origins. They are limited by the finite conditions of time and space. No planetary religion can be absolute. Second, all religions have a common essence-living faith and the search for spiritual reality. In this experience and in the perennial philosophy by which humanity tries to understand spiritual encounters, all religions are essentially the same. Third, all religions have a common psychological origin — the human psyche. All people have a superconscious experience whereby they intuit a spiritual dimension of reality.

In the ecumenical atmosphere of our contemporary world can Christians continue to proclaim Jesus as the only savior of humanity? Different Christian traditions speak to this question from divergent theological perspectives. Conservative evangelicals declare that salvation is the result of the sacrificial death of Jesus “once and for all and for all mankind.” Revelation and salvation are obtainable only in Jesus Christ.

Mainline theologians seek a more positive and dialogical relationship with other religions. They believe God is revealed in all cultures and to all people. There is a connection between this general revelation and the revelation of Jesus, but such a general revelation is partial and inadequate. Only in Christ can a person realize that one is saved by faith alone; although, at the end of history all will be granted a knowledge of Jesus and have an opportunity for salvation. A few theologians like Hans Küng and Karl Rahner speak of God's desire to save all humankind and believe that the grace of Christ cannot be confined to Christianity.

A Christian minority position is emerging among thinkers like John Hick, Raimundo Panikkar, and Stanley Samartha which Knitter calls the “theocentric model” of salvation. It affirms there is one Spirit, one Divine Reality, behind all religions. Differences are due to historical, cultural, or psychological adaptations of this reality experience. God is truly encountered in Jesus but not only in Jesus. Panikkar speaks of the universal Christ and the particular Jesus. All religions recognize, one way or another, this Christ. Although the New Testament writers were Christocentric, Jesus himself was theocentric. There is a growing consensus that the church is not to be identified with the kingdom of God. All religions are included in the kingdom and Jesus is seen working within every religion.

> _The Christian church may be on the verge of experiencing a “kairos” of self-transformation, a “third reformation,” which will make it a true world church._

Paul Knitter maintains that Jesus was profoundly theocentric and seeks to establish a theocentric Christology. Such a view is consistent with historic Christianity and harmonious with the signs of the times. Religion grows by seeking truth through ever expanding relationships. This truth is leading us toward a global theology. Jesus of Nazareth is the unifying expression of God's love which will continue to transform our world.

This is a book of first-rate creative theology which will challenge the reader to rethink basic Christian concepts. It should be required reading for anyone who wishes to keep abreast of the growing edge of theological thinking regarding the doctrine of salvation and Christian attitudes toward other religions. Knitter's view is harmonious with the Christology of _The Urantia Book_ which presents Jesus as both a unique universe personality and an inclusive mediator for all God seeking people.
