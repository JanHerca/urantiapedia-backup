Like _The Jefferson Bible_, Preston Thomas, founder of the Einstein School, has compiled a restatement of the Gospels. The first edition of _The Life and Teachings of Jesus_ was published in May of 1992, and the second edition in November of 2000. This book is a succinct arrangement of the New Testament story following the chronology of _The Urantia Book_ narrative. It is an effective presentation of the events in the life and teachings of Jesus.

The “Thomas Bible” is an efficient way to introduce people to the Gospel story or an expedient method of reviewing the life and teachings of Jesus. After years of reading _The Urantia Book_ and the New Testament Gospels, I tend to forget where specific statements or accounts are located. The Thomas narrative is a convenient way to clarify my memory. You may find other uses for this interface between the Gospels and _The Urantia Book_.
