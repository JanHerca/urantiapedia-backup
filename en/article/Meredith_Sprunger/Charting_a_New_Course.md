For the past six years _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ has promoted an interface between mainline Christian clergy and the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Although this dialogue has been positive, it is obvious that most of the leaders of the Christian Church have too much at stake to seriously examine and evaluate a new spiritual paradigm. It will probably be generations before the Christian Church will recognize _The Urantia Book_ as an acceptable resource for teaching and preaching.

We are now directing the Journal in a new direction with students of _The Urantia Book_ as our main audience. Our new mission is to: “Promote Theological, Philosophical, and Polity Discussions Germane to an Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.” The rational for this new mission is given in the article in this issue of the Journal entitled, "Our Major Responsibility: Disseminating the Fifth Epochal Revelation.”

## Call for Papers

At the Flagstaff Conference a number of us got together and initiated “The Theological and Philosophical Working Group” to stimulate discussion and encourage the writing of papers on topics inspired by _The Urantia Book_. The Editors of _The Spiritual Fellowship Journal_ should like to invite the submission of papers, pro and con, related to evolving an appropriate symbolism and socioreligious expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, or any topic germane to a critical study of _The Urantia Book_.
