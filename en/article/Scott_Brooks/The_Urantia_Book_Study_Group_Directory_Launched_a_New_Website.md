_By Scott Brooks, Ohio, United States_

In July, _The Urantia Book_ Study Group Directory launched its new website at urantiastudygroup.org. The development of the site was an undertaking that took more than a year. The directory now has a fresh look and includes many new features to make it easier to use.

One such feature is the new format that gives every study group host the flexibility to manage the listing without having to go through the administrative team. The chosen representative of each group can add the listing, change meeting dates and times, and can even delete the listing. There is also a place to describe and modify the format or topic of study currently being used. The only caveat is that the administrative team will scrutinize any group that is disregarding the criteria required for listing a study group and will determine if action needs to be taken.

More than 50 percent of the 1,000 monthly visitors use mobile devices or tablets to access the site. So it was important to make it completely mobile responsive. Visitors can also specify a country, postal code, and the name of the host or coordinator or the city. They will also be presented with a list of study groups, including a map that matches the search criteria.

More than 400 study groups representing 42 countries in 17 languages are listed in the directory. Wow! Of these, nearly 100 are virtual study groups. About a year and a half ago, there were only four virtual groups. Such growth is phenomenal; people anywhere in the world with Internet access can now participate in a study group.

For those unfamiliar with a virtual study group, it is a study group that is available via the Internet. You can see, hear, and speak to others by using your computer's built-in camera and microphone. You just need to install the computer application necessary to attend the meeting. Some of the more popular applications used are Zoom and Skype.

The new updated website was launched just in time for the annual database survey. All groups listed will be contacted in order to validate current information and ensure that the group is still meeting. Unresponsive groups will be culled from the directory.

Making sure that all listed study groups verify their information has proven to be one of the biggest challenges facing the team. So, if your study group is listed, expect an email from us soon, and please respond in a timely manner. If you have forgotten your password, just let us know, and we will send directions describing how to access your account.

If you have a study group but are not listed in the directory, please take 10 minutes and register now at https://www.urantiastudygroup.org/register.

The directory is provided as a free and open service to students of _The Urantia Book_ to facilitate inspiring personal connections and ongoing study of the book. It is a joint project supported by Urantia Association International, the Urantia Book Fellowship, and Urantia Foundation.

The current team members are Bill Beasley, Scott Brooks, Jackie Koury, Rick Lyon, and Tamara Strumfeld.

> Visitors can also specify a country, postal code, and the name of the host or coordinator or the city.
