True worship goes directly to God the Father, and he is the source of all things, including energy. “_... energy ... as a universe phenomenon is inherent in the Universal Father._” (<a id="a36_182"></a>[UB 42:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_2)) Worship is a method of tapping into that energy. The technique requires total self-forgetfulness; it implies no self-motivation. “_There is absolutely no self-request or other element of personal interest in true worship..._” (<a id="a36_452"></a>[UB 5:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_3))

A person suffocates himself who would willingly choke the urge to worship and shut out this energy, this life given freely by God. This is like the limitation of freedom suffered by him who is unwilling to submit his will to God's. This person maintains total control of his decisions and destiny to the very limited extent his own abilities and wisdom will allow; whereas, if he gives himself to the will of the Father, he loses this false freedom but gains a prison with walls of infinity and eternity. Perhaps the most effective measure to acquire this true freedom, and the resulting power and energy which result from being in consonance with God, is to establish a conscious, loving rapport with him: to worship. “_And this interchange of strength for weakness, courage for fear, the will of God for the mind of self, constitutes worship._” (<a id="a38_848"></a>[UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1))

So what begins as a result of self-forgetfulness eventually rewards one who would worship. For, in addition to tapping into the energy of the universe, one creates energy in the loving of his fellow man. To truly worship means to love or, “_... worship God for what we comprehend him to be,_” even as Father, (<a id="a40_310"></a>[UB 5:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_3)) And loving God must be accompanied by loving man, even as the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man are interdependent. The more one loves God the Father, the more he is able to love others. And, since love is contagious, the more he is loved. Though the Father's love is never withheld and is always infinite, the individual's ability to appreciate that love increases as his own capacity to love increases. What greater energy can result than that from the love of God and from other men?
