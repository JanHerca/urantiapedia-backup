<p class="v-card v-sheet theme--light grey lighten-3 px-2">Â© 1994 David Kulieke</p>

The whole in the sky
Spinning frost-like between the trees
Telescoping me to everything else with
Eternity just beyond my grasp.
My outstretched fingers not quite.
Touching it;
But it blankets me
As I lie on the
Leaf and twig strews carpet and
Float suspended
Between the earth and the
Friendly universe.
