## Welcome to the Fellowship Forum Seminars

The 2021 Summer Study Session (SSS) will not meet in person for the first time since the series started in the 1970s. This year it had been scheduled for the weekend of July 22-25 at Techny Towers. The Education Committee was excited to present a theme based on Machiventa Melchizedek, as 2021 is Machiventa's 4,000^th^ anniversary of incarnating on Urantia.

Instead, the committee will present the Fellow ship Forum Seminars: Virtual Summer Study Session (VSSS) 2021 in our ongoing series of online seminars. The VSSS will spread out over seven two-hour time slots during that same weekend of July 22-25. The theme will be “A Hitchhiker's Guide to Urantia: What a Wonderful World!” This theme will explore how Urantia is unique.

The sessions will open on Thursday, July 22, from 6 to 8 PM , CDT. Tim Duffy, an Education Committee adjunct, will deliver the keynote: “How Urantia Is Different (and Why It Matters).” Tim's keynote will be followed by a virtual wine and cheese along with chatting on chat. The remaining sessions will occur twice on Friday, three times on Saturday, and once on Sunday.

Saturday afternoon's session will honor incoming and outgoing General Councilors under the direction of Cristina Seaborn, Sue Snider Seccombe, and Karen Larsen.

The closing session on Sunday morning will include a worship session and acknowledge Machiventa's anniversary in anticipation of moving the Machiventa theme to SSS2022.

The other four sessions are still in the planning stages, but they all will have Bobbie Dreier's captivating spiritual introductions. The presenters and leaders will rely on a heavy complement of the Fellowship's Education Committee personnel as well as other readers of The Urantia Book.

For those interested in the topic of how Urantia is unique, there is no lack of material. The richest source is [Paper 52](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52), “Planetary Mortal Epochs,” and there is a great deal of evidence throughout the book. Some ideas include that we are an experimental, decimal planet; that our first two revelations went astray; that our next three revelations are highly unusual; and that Urantia is far off the developmental timeline of a normal planet. There are many other fascinating and relevant topics that the seminars will explore in July. The Education Committee hopes to virtually see you!

We will Celebrate Machiventa's 4,001^st^ Anniversary in 2022!
