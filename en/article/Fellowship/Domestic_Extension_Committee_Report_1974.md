The Domestic Extension Committee has continued to foster a number of projects begun in previous years. Urantia Books are being placed in public, and university libraries, and increasingly, in prison libraries.

Last year the committee began to think about the preparation of a packet of information to be made available to inquirers. The original idea was that the kit should be a publicity type of kit, but more recently, it has been realized that the more immediate need is for an information kit. It would be made available to persons thinking of starting a study group, and to other types of organizations who want facts about our organizations. The material to be included will be compiled from already existing brochures, letter extracts, policy guides, as well as information to be devised.
