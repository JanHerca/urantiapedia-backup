Re: ??? letter of October 2nd

Dear Friends;

??? in my letter of October 2, I forgot to include one important question I was asked in California when I solicited donations and bequests to the Foundation for translations: What will various translations cost under your supervision?

One member of the Los Angeles Brotherhood expressed willingness to sponsor a German translation for the $15,000.00 estimated cost it can be obtained for in ??? .

I have drawn several wills providing for large general bequests to the Foundation. You have given so many readers to doubt the wisdom of my past recommendations. When you give me reasonable answers to my many requests the more I will be able in the future to continue to recommend your administration of your trust.

Yesterday I received a most interesting 3 page report from Jacques Weiss. No doubt you also received one.

Enclosed is one of his sales promotion circulars. I had it translated into English by a teacher of French here. I doubt if she did a very good job.

With best regards,

Very truly for progress while I live,

Robert Burton
