A MESSAGE FROM THE Urantia FOUNDATION
An Excerpt
June 15, 1972

**Problems**

<ins>Financial.</ins>

While the Foundation's financial position has steadily improved over the years, we still are not in a position to do the many things we would like to do — nor the things some of our friends think we should do. The contributions received to cover expenses are still inadequate.

<ins>People in a Hurry.</ins>

One of our most time-consuming problems concerns individuals (members and non-members) who want to immediately change the world by an over-rapid distribution of the Urantia Book. this, despite the fact that they have been told many times that the world is not ready. It took Adam and Eve over 100 years to get impatient; we shouldn't become restless in less than 20 years. These good, but impatient, people want the Foundation to rush into all kinds of things — a proliferation of translations, advertising, and all kinds of promotional ideas and gimmicks which would be unwise, even if the Foundation had the necessary funds therefor. The Urantia Book is intended for the indefinite future, not just today.

<ins>People Who Want to Attach Themselves to the Urantia Movement for Their Own Purposes.</ins>

This is another problem which takes a great amount of time — correspondence, interviews, etc.

It takes a great deal of time and patience to cope with these problems.
