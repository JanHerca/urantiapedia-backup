RE: Conflict of Interest, Autocracy vs. Democracy

The Urantia Foundation & Urantia Brotherhood
533 Diversey Parkway
Chicago, IL 60614

Dear Friends:

In retrospect the Triennial Assembly was a most interesting play and inter-play of conflicting interests.

Christy read of the test of delay and unity while we were a Forum waiting for the publication of the Urantia Book. She read that “good government should be a consistent organization in which a majority must rule and a defeated minority go in peace.” With good government “serious dissention and revolt would be avoided”. We were admonished to “be diligent and loyal to your trust.”

In Bill's Triennial Report (1955-57) read Section V. By professional training, vocation, and many years of broad practical experience in organization administration, since 1899, Bill would classify me as “the impatient professional.”

In Bill's “Transition Adjustment Problems,” he anticipated the difficulties administrators of the older Forum group would have in adjusting their obligations as officers of the self governing Brotherhood where officers are elected to administer the will and pleasure of the membership as expresed by a majority vote.

Secrecy of policy decisions and ill advised suppression of the lawful right of members to present controversial matters for the consideration of the General Council for its free expression of its wishes by a majority vote, is an unworthy, disloyal breach of trust on the part of administrators.

Because I hope to see a strong Official Urantia Organization maintained, I deplore such lack of faith in and violation of the principles of fairness and justice that should guide the elected administrators of our self governing Brotherhood.

You must feel very weak, insecure, and vulnerable to make you afraid to trust the good will and reasonablneness of the General Council members as the elected representatives of the Urantia Brotherhood.

I would like for you to obtain from your attorney a brief of his legal authorities that justify his advising you that your copyright and trade mark registrations are legal and will stand up if challenged in court. Send me a copy.

Then let us get together and see if we can work without undue friction for our mutual objectives, as good brothers should agree and serve.

Fraternally, and very truly for diligence in sharing the Urantia Revelation with people in all Nations who need it now.

Robert Burton
