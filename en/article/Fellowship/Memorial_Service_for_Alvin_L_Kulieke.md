My strength is broken in mid-course; my days have been shortened. [Ps. 102:23](/en/Bible/Psalms/102#v23)

None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lords. [Rom. 14:7-8](/en/Bible/Romans/14#v7)

Death is always a traumatic experience. It is especially so when our friends and loved ones are taken in the prime of life.

Alvin L. Kulieke was a man of faith and a pillar of strength to a great many people.

He was a loving and devoted husband and father.

He was a dedicated school administrator and enthusiastic teacher.

He was an active church and community worker.

His contributions to life in this community have been significant and for this service he will long be remembered.

But I believe he will be remembered and honored in generations to come for leadership in a movement the existence of which many of his friends were and are unaware. For more than thirty years Alvin has been active in one of the most advanced spiritual movements on our planet.

He was one of a select group of people who were entrusted with the responsibility of bringing a most unusual spiritual message to mankind. This message is incorporated in a book entitled, The Urantia Book, which was published in 1955. The spiritual quality of this book is of such epochal significance that it will certainly become a major influence on our world for centuries to come.

Alvin assumed major responsibilities in the organization and activities of the Urantia Brotherhood. At the time of his death he was effectively serving as president of the Urantia Brotherhood, which, even in its infancy, has had world-wide contacts.

Alvin Kulieke, where ever he has served, brought unique and durable personal qualities to the tasks at hand. He was a steadfast and loyal person. He was a pillar of strength to his family, his school, and the Urantia Brotherhood. In times of great stress such as the sudden death of his brother, Warren, his brother-in-law, Edgar Stephens, and his nephew Philip Stephens, or in the critical illness of his son, Tom, - Alvin carried on with a faith and fortitude that he would want us to emulate today. Nevertheless, he will be sorely missed by all.

A second quality which impressed me in Alvin's life was his ability to project calmness and exercise balanced judgment in critical situations. He had the capacity to calm troubled spirits and quiet troubled waters. And we are reminded that the Sons of God are known as peace-makers, a quality greatly needed in our contemporary world.

Third, Alvin Kulieke was a diligent and enthusiastic teacher. Many times I have admired his pedagogical excellence. The prophets may bring us new visions for tomorrow; but it is the teachers who will lead the successive generations of mankind into new epochs of living.

A fourth quality that those of who knew Alvin Kulieke appreciated, was that he was a warm, considerate, and kind human being. Although his deep convictions caused him at times to stand firm, he took these positions with great restraint and concern for those who may have disagreed with him. To know his inner spirit was to love him. He had a great humanness rooted in the conviction of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man. He radiated good will.

Finally, Alvin had an active sense of humor and a love for music which consistently interjected themselves into his communication with others. He was able to smile and laugh even while carrying heavy burdens. He took his responsibilities seriously but he never took himself too seriously. His good sense of humor constantly lightened and gave perspective to the problems of life.

Alvin had a fine voice which I know must have stimulated congregational singing in this church. Several years ago he sang a solo in the little country congregation I serve and they still remember him with gratitude.

Although we sorrow at losing a dear friend, we would also recognize this occasion as a time of rejoicing. For those of us who share Alvin's faith and vision of man's destiny, we are filled with warmth and joy that his life has now risen to more glorious potentials.

In this spirit I should like to share with you some passages of comfort and inspiration which were favorites of Alvin's and which he loved to read: We should ever remember:

There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving! The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! Whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of God's spirit and on the guidance of that good spirit of Jesus, which so freely has been poured out upon all flesh. ([UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8))

We humans have begun an endless unfolding of an almost infinite panorama, a limitless expanding of never-ending, ever-widening spheres of opportunity for exhilarating service, matchless adventure, sublime uncertainty, and boundless attainment. When the clouds gather overhead, our faith should accept the fact of the presence of the indwelling Spirit of God, and thus we should be able to look beyond the mists of mortal uncertainty into the clear shining of the sun of eternal righteousness on the beckoning heights of the many mansions in our Father's house. ([UB 108:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_8))

Truly, no man lives to himself nor dies to himself. In a very real sense Alvin Kulieke will continue living in our lives and in our Brotherhood. To you of his family and to all of us who will miss his warmth and leadership, I should like to leave with a message of encouragement and guidance for the future. This message was given by Alvin in his keynote address at the Triennial Delegate Assembly of the Urantia Brotherhood in August of 1967: “We are all placed here with an immediate task to perform, and we can be privileged in leaving our imprint on this world even as we are developing a spiritual counterpart that will carry us to a more glorious life of enhanced service... ” “To be leaders — to be one of those who will help push this world over the brink into one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment — we need to dare to depend solely upon Jesus and his incomparable teachings.”

“We have many examples to inspire and guide us — the versatility and steadfastness of Andrew, the persistent loyalty of Ruth and Rebecca, the ingenuity and dependability of David Zebedee, the zeal of Peter, and above all the cool courage of John, who calmly accompanied his Master into the very jaws of death.”

Here we have Alvin L. Kulieke's priorities for living and facing the future: Versatility and steadfastness; Persistent loyalty; Ingenuity and dependability; Zeal; Cool courage — all dedicated to the will of God.

With these qualities of life, which he lived superbly, we can face the future with confidence and joy.

Let us pray: Eternal Father we are grateful that in your plan there is, for every individual, an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress and endless life. May each of us strive at each step to anticipate this goal of eternity and perfection ahead. Help us to understand that the door is open to all who live by faith, depending every step of the way on the leading of your spirit mediated to us so freely by our Lord, Jesus Christ. We pray that you may comfort us in our sorrow and give us imagination of heart enough to rejoice that another of your children has entered the larger life in the mansions of your kingdom.

Amen.
