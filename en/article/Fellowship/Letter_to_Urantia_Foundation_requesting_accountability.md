Regarding: Cooperation with contributors

Dear Friends:

Ruth and I plan to go to Oregon and California for the winter. Before we go (about the 15th of December) I would like for you to furnish me with certain information that all members of the Urantia Brotherhood and contributors of funds to the Urantia Foundation are lawfully entitled to have:

1. A summary of your receipts and disbursements since the beginning of your trusteeship.

2. A copy of your last annual financial report.

3. A copy of your last Income Tax Report

I would like to get these from you, but of course as a contributor I can get copies of your annual reports from the Attorney General of Illinois, and a copy of your last income tax report from the Internal Revenue Department.

4. A statement of your present plans and intentions regarding your future administration of your trust.

5. Many Urantia brothers on the west coast would like to have your answers to Al Leverense's questions: What are you doing about getting foreign translations? What one are you working on now? What will it cost under your supervision?

6. When Ruth and I returned from Israel last year we visited Sophia ???. She told us she would like to sponsor a German or Hebrew translation of the U.B. She has since died and left a bequest to the Urantia Foundation. It would be a deserved honor to her memory if you used her money in obtaining a foreign translation and credited her with sponsoring it. What are you going to do with her money? I am her old friend and would like to know.

I am concerned and would like to know what is being done with my contributions and I am sure all contributors would like to have your ansers to the above questions.

John Quincy Adams said in effect; that he did not approve of secrecy by public officials and administrators, that it was likely to be used to hide wrongdoing, incompetence, and to avoid criticism. People doing right have nothing to hide.

Your First Edition of the U.B. has forever guaranteed the original purity of the text. Most of us who want to share the Urantia Book with all who need it would rather have good cheap offset printed editions and many foreign translations published before foundations funds are squandered on more delux editions. Surely you can trust the General Council of the Urantia Brotherhood.

Why not give annual reports of your doings and financial accounting to the General Council and discuss future policies and projects with them as the Executive Committee does?

As Trustees you were self appointed and are self perpetuating to act in behalf of contributors and donors. After frank discussion, why not be guided by the majority vote of the General Council? It is chosen to represent those you are supposed to represent.

With my best regards, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Very truly for progress now while I live,

Robert Burton
