To: The Delegates attending the Tri-annual [sic] Conference of the Urantia Brotherhood to be held July 31st in Chicago at 533 Diversey Parkway:

It has been recommended that the following RESOLUTIONS be presented to the General Council of the Urantia Brotherhood for their consideration and action.

No 1. BE IT RESOLVED: That the Urantia Foundation be requested and required to render a prompt accounting of all its receipts and disbursements since the date of its organization.

No 2. BE IT RESOLVED: That the Urantia Foundation be required to render to the General Council an annual accounting, as the Urantia Brotherhood does.

No 3. BE IT RESOLVED: That the Urantia Foundation be required to discuss its proposed policies and expenditures with the General Council and be guided and required to act in accord with the wishes of the General Council as expressed by a majority vote thereof.

No 4. BE IT RESOLVED: That it is the wish of the General Council that before more money is spent for Delux Editions of the Urantia Book that good, off-set printed, three-volume, paper-back editions be obtained and made available for readers who can not afford Delux hard-back books.

No 5. BE IT RESOLVED: That before more money is spent on Delux Editions that good translations of the Urantia Book be obtained in German, Japanese, Chinese and Spanish languages. And that such foreign language translations be published in good, three-volume, paper-back editions, thus to speed the dissemination of the Urantia Revelation with the people of other nations.

No 6. BE IT RESOLVED: That the Executive Committee be required to report to the General Council annually all of its important policy decisions and administrative actions since its previous report.

Since the General Council represents the members of the Urantia Brotherhood and the donors and contributors to the funds of the Urantia Foundation it is very important that it be informed of all official action taken in their behalf.

The foregoing RESOLUTIONS are respectfully presented for the consideration of the General Council in behalf of and at the requrest of many of such members and such donors and contributors in order that fairness, justice, and brotherhly love may be maintained and prevail in all organizations officially representing the Urantia Brotherhood.

Very truly for progress in sharing the Urantia Revelation with all the people of the world, Urantia.

Robert Burton
