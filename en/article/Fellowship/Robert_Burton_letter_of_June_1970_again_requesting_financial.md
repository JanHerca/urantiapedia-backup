Re: Your reluctance to answer fair questions

Dear Friends:

Last winter in California and Oklahoma City I was embarrassed because you ahd failed to answer their questions that I reported to you May 5th last year. Also, you did not answer my letters of October 2nd and October 9th last Fall requesting information all donors and contributors to Urantia Foundation funds are lawfully entitled to receive.

When you and the Urantia Brotherhood solicited funds for 1970, you gave a budget estimate of $12,000.00, “the same amount as 1969.” But you gave no accounting of how you spent the $12,000.00 in 1969. Many asked me about it. All contributors are, in fairness, entitled to know how their money is being spent.

Because I have for years (ever since you were organized) urged that contributions and bequests be made to you and because I ahve drawn several wills providing large bequests to you, I have a duty to my clients and feel obligated in behalf of all contributors. THEREFORE I demand that you answer fully those questions that I have heretofore asked in behalf of contributors and my clients.

Before pressing this matter further I will present it for the attention and consideration of the General Council of the Urantia Brotherhood.

You and the Urantia Brotherhood Executive Committee were created to carry out the will and pleasure of contributors and members and you both should fully account to and be responsive to their wishes as may be expressed by a majority vote of the General Council.

I thoroughly believe that open discussion among people of good will is the best way to clear up and solve most problems.

Very truly for sharing the Urantia Revelation with all people,

Fraternally,

Robert Burton
