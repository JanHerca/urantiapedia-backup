**Urantia BROTHERHOOD INTRA-OFFICE MEMORANDUM**

December 10, 1970

FROM: Alvin Kulieke, President, E. L. Christensen, Vice President

TO: Societies, Field Representatives, Study Groups

Once again we extend greetings to you at this holiday season when our part of the world celebrates in a variety of ways the birthday of Jesus. Even though the day selected for this is the birthday of Mithras, many sincere believers in Jesus will observe his birthday and render thanks and worship concerning this bestowal of Michael with just as much dedication as those who recognize Jesus' birthday on the twenty-first of August. We feel that, at least as individuals, we would do well to join with the established churches of Christianity in their celebration at this time of year.

We are always pleased to report progress to you. Since our Triennial Assembly last summer the sale of Urantia Books has continued to increase, and we know that many of these are going to people who have accepted the teachings of the revelation and are enthusiastically spreading their convictions to others. The supply of the second printing is rapidly dwindling, but the third printing should be available in the early part of next year.

We continue to see much turbulence and unsettled conditions in many cities of our nation and in other countries around the globe. A year or two ago we suggested that we expected many changes with accompanying tensions, anxiety, and suffering, particularly as our “social ship has steamed out of the sheltered bays of established tradition” and is now roughing it “upon the high seas of evolutionary destiny.” It looks to us as though there has been some easing of the tension and that we have moved to slightly less stormy seas.

Possibly we have traversed the worst of the unsettled conditions and more favorable and more gentle winds will move our social craft. Not enough people have as yet been changed by the teachings of Jesus to have an effective impact upon the conditions of the world, but we should look with optimism to the future. We know that all things will work together for good for those who are striving to align their plans with the will of the Father. This should especially apply to those who are conscientiously working toward accomplishing the purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Our group is still very small, but its rate of growth is increasing. The day will come when adherents of the Urantia movement will have a noticeable effect upon the progress of the world as it struggles in this post Bestowal Son dispensation. It is encouraging to note that younger adults are moving toward becoming Urantians. Perhaps by the time another generation passes a much larger part of the world may be ready to accept these supernal teachings.

## Some News Items About Our People

H. Caston who has spent three or four months in Vancouver, British Columbia with M. Nichols and his movie group has now moved to New York where he hopes to have his book about Mr. Nichols and his work published.

B. and D. Gray have moved from Lawrence, Kansas to Berkeley, California where they are, in addition to their own jobs, helping Vern and Nancy Grimsley on the Foundation of God [sic] project.

Ruth and Bob Burton have left Coon Hollow, Three Rivers, Michigan, and are living in Los Angeles for the winter.

Jim and Eunice Mills left Saturday, December 5, for Paris where they will spend a week, and then go on to London for another week. They will be back in Neenah for Christmas.

We were pleasantly surprised a couple of months ago by a visit from Harold Heath and his wife from Kent, Washington. Harold's company, the Heath Tecna Corp. is having difficulty on account of the depression following the closing of airplane factories in Seattle. Otherwise, they seemed well and happy. It was a real joy to see them.

Ruth Renn expects to spend Christmas and some weeks with her daughter in Stamford, Connecticut.

Nancy and Vern Grimsley are deeply involved and very, very busy with the Family of God broadcasts. They write very enthusiastic letters about their many responses to their message. They are doing a great job.

Berkeley Elliott telephoned Sunday, December 4, to tell us about various reading groups that she is contacting and assisting, and I am sure ere long some of these will be ready for organization into Societies.

We also had a call recently from Julia Fenderson telling us that she is enjoying her work at the college and that this job gives her more time for Urantia work. She recently had a reception in her home for some of the new young people who have come to California and who are enthusiastic readers of the Urantia Book. She has many telephone calls, as do all of the Field Representatives, I am sure.

Irene and Meredith Sprunger report a very good attendance for their weekly meetings and new people seem to be joining them from time to time. All is well with them both. They recently paid us a week-end visit which we very much enjoyed.
