_By Betty Zehr, Co-chair of the Faculty Development Committee for UBIS, Waverly, New York, USA_

The first trimester of the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) in 2012 is just beyond the half way mark. Seven courses are in session; topics range from the “Wisdom of the Melchizedeks” to “Time and Space.” The teaching method is Jesusonian and noninterpretive. This is a place for Teacher-Facilitators (TFs) and students to share together, in a focused and nurturing way, the knowledge he or she has discovered in _The Urantia Book_. The goal is to delve more deeply into the subjects of eternal significance and to enlarge our concepts of that precious, lifegiving, living truth that nourishes the soul so abundantly.

Our greatest need is to identify, recruit, and train passionate students of the truths found in _The Urantia Book_ who have the potential to become TFs. An internet community of dedicated and experienced TFs is committed to helping new teachers so that they are not alone in this process. After taking the teacher training course, the new teacher is assisted in selecting a topic and constructing the course. The teacher is then mentored throughout the first course; there is always someone to turn to for assistance when questions arise and to offer words of encouragement.

One of the special aspects of UBIS is that now truth seekers anywhere in the world who have access to a computer and speak English or Spanish can share in the rich fellowship of learning no matter how isolated they are. We shall be offering classes in other languages as soon as we find qualified teachers. If you are interested in becoming a TF, please register for a course to begin the process.

The following quotation makes us reasonably confident that our efforts vis-à-vis UBIS will continue to bear fruit worthy of its association with the Fifth Epochal Revelation:

> “That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father's will. When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do happen.” <a id="a50_342"></a>[UB 132:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9)

> The teaching method is Jesusonian and non-interpretive.
