During the past six months, our Pipeline of Light volunteers placed two hundred and fourteen copies of _The Urantia Book_ into nine countries. Your donations to the Pipeline helped us deliver books to readers and study groups in Mexico, Canada, the United States, Ukraine, Chile, Germany, Cameroon, Argentina, and a new country for our list, Bermuda.

Books sent out this period include one hundred eighty-one English books, fifteen Spanish translations, five French books, ten German, and four Russian. The current effort brings our Pipeline alltime totals to nine thousand, six hundred and ninety two copies of _The Urantia Book_ placed into ninety one countries around the world. Many thanks to the wonderful volunteers who keep this flow of books moving into the world for us!
