_By Michelle Klimesh, Pipeline of Light Coordinator, Danville, California, USA_

This summer the Pipeline of Light reached a milestone. In the eight years since its inception, a total of three thousand copies of _The Urantia Book_ have been placed with readers around the world. The Pipeline of Light is a service of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship. Our efforts, however, are truly cooperative with the bulk of books we ship out each year being translations published by Urantia Foundation. The Spanish translation, _El Libro de Urantia_, is our most highly requested book.

Readers from the following 71 countries have received _The Urantia Book_ from the Pipeline:

Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Bahrain, Belize, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chechnya, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Dominican Rep., Ecuador, Egypt, EI Salvador, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Guinea, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Italy, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Moldavia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, South Vietnam, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Togo, Turkey
