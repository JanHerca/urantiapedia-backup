Dear Friends,

During the past three months, our Pipeline of Light volunteers placed one hundred, ninetyseven copies of _The Urantia Book_ into eight countries. Your donations to the Pipeline helped us deliver books to readers and study groups in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, the Congo, and Peru.

Books sent out this period include one hundred eighty-one English books, fourteen Spanish translations, and two French books.

The current effort brings our Pipeline all-time totals to nine thousand, four hundred and seventy-eight copies of _The Urantia Book_ placed into ninety countries around the world. Many thanks to the wonderful volunteers who keep this flow of books moving into the world for us!

We deeply appreciate the contributions of our volunteers and our donors. If you would like to contribute to this work, donations can be made online at:

or by mail to:

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, PO Box 6631, Broomfield, CO 80021 Thank you so much for your support.

Michelle Klimesh, Pipeline Reporter

## P.S. from Michelle Klimesh

Dear Friends,

How lovely to be appreciated! BUT I assure you that I am not the person who deserves congratulations. My only contribution these days is to send you a note every quarter, revealing what the hard-working Pipeline peeps have been doing lately. That said, maybe this works like prayer does... we can pray to whomever we want, knowing that our petitions will be forwarded to the proper agent.

So THANK YOU to DEREK and PAULA in the office, SOREN and MICHAEL in the field, and other nameless strangers who magically figure out how to connect the books we have to share with the humans who need them.

Pipeline placement = planting seeds. Thanks for your support.
