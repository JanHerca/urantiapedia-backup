It can get confusing to keep track of who does what in the administration of spiritual affairs on our planet. This topical study will help clarify the different roles of the many celestial beings charged with managing this small, but significant planet in the system of Satania.

Title | Page
:--- | ---:
**Associate Inspector**<br>Resident on Salvington, capital of Nebadon; personal representative of the Supreme Executive of Orvonton. | <a id="a42_135"></a>[UB 37:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p8_5)
**Assigned Sentinel of Satania**<br>Coordinating personality and liaison representative, advisor and observer. Ex officio head of 24 Counselors, but does not participate in deliberations on system affairs. | <a id="a43_208"></a>[UB 114:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_3)
**Brilliant Evening Stars**<br>Represent Gabriel. Easily visible to morontia personalities and supermortal material beings. Possess a spirit force that can manifest itself independently of personal presence. Firstborn in Nebadon is Gavalia, now assigned by Michael to the ascendant ministry, along with his associate Galantia, who maintains liaison contact with Michael for the 24 Counselors. | <a id="a44_395"></a>[UB 20:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p9_3)<br><a id="a44_440"></a>[UB 37:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_1)<br><a id="a44_485"></a>[UB 45:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_2)<br><a id="a44_530"></a>[UB 46:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p5_13)
**Four and Twenty Counselors**<br>Michael's personal agents on Jerusem, functioning somewhat like a legislative branch of government. Also manage affairs of 36 other isolated planets. One serves as Resident Governor General, the coordinator of all superhuman administration, who is more of a fatherly advisor than a technical ruler. This position rotates every 100 years. The cabinet consists of heads of 12 divisions of Master Seraphim. | <a id="a45_440"></a>[UB 45:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_1)<br><a id="a45_485"></a>[UB 76:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_3)
**Chief of Resident Life Carriers**<br>One of 12 who elected to remain on Urantia after appearance of will creatures and the arrival of the Planetary Prince. | <a id="a46_160"></a>[UB 36:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p3_6)<br><a id="a46_205"></a>[UB 58:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p0_1)
**Commanding Archangel**<br>Supreme authority in exclusively spiritual problems and certain personal matters. Maintains a divisional headquarters recently established on Urantia by Michael. | <a id="a47_192"></a>[UB 37:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_1)<br><a id="a47_237"></a>[UB 46:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p3_4)<br><a id="a47_282"></a>[UB 65:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p1_6)<br><a id="a47_327"></a>[UB 189:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_1)
**Chief of Seraphim**<br>A Primary Supernaphim of Paradise in command of all ministering spirits. Rotates periodically on special assignment to this rebellion world. Her associate chief is Manotia, the Loyal Seraphic Commander of Jerusem. She is further supported by 1,000 Administrative Assistant Seraphim and certain specialized angels whose work extends through morontial and spiritual levels. They are grouped as follows: | <a id="a48_428"></a>[UB 27:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p0_2)<br><a id="a48_473"></a>[UB 39:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_1)<br><a id="a48_518"></a>[UB 53:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p6_1)
**Planetary Helpers**<br>\* Voices of the Garden (Solonia, et al)<br>\* Spirits of Brotherhood<br>\* Souls of Peace (Vevona, et al)<br>\* Spirits of Trust<br>\* Transporters<br>\* Recorders<br>\* Reserves<br> | <a id="a49_211"></a>[UB 39:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_3)
**Transition Ministers**<br>\* Seraphic Evangels<br>\* Racial Interpreters<br>\* Mind Planners<br>\* Morontia Counselors<br>\* Technicians<br>\* Recorders/Teachers<br>\* Ministering Reserves<br>| <a id="a50_196"></a>[UB 48:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_1)
**Master Physical Controllers**<br>\* 10 Mechanical Controllers<br>\* 100 Energy Transformers<br>\* 1,000 Energy Transmitters<br>\* Primary Associators/Secondary Disassociators<br>\* Frandalanks/Chronoldeks<br> | <a id="a51_213"></a>[UB 29:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_4)
**Most High Observer**<br>A Vorondadek Son, one of 12 governing Edentia, 491 our Constellation headquarters. In the event of a planetary crisis, this Son may seize authority and function as sovereign. He has done so 33 times in the past, at which time he employed a “full and complete staff” and received unsought support from three Personalized Adjusters. | <a id="a52_359"></a>[UB 35:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p5_6)
**Personalized Adjusters**<br>The personal ministers of the extraordinary, unusual and unexpected in all the realms. | <a id="a53_119"></a>[UB 109:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p7_1)
**Race Commissioners**<br>Perfected Spirit-fused beings/mortals who function as “friends of the court” to ensure mercy, justice and fair treatment for all evolving races. | <a id="a54_173"></a>[UB 25:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p2_1)<br><a id="a54_218"></a>[UB 37:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p5_7)
**Conciliating Commission**<br>When petitioned by personalities in conflict, these ministers resolve differences and have supreme authority to put their decisions into effect. There are three judges and a quasi-material “fourth creature,” the Divine Executioner, who has great power and range of activity on an inhabited world, including command of the Master Physical Controllers. | <a id="a55_384"></a>[UB 25:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p2_5)
**Celestial Artisans**<br>An entire paper is devoted to their unfathomable and multi-faceted endeavors. | <a id="a56_106"></a>[UB 44:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p0_1)
