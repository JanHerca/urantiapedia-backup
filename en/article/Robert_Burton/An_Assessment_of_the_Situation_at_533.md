October 1975

The fifth epochal revelation of truth to the mortal races of Urantia, (our world) came in response to serious questions asked by truth seekers, members of a group, that called themselves, Sadler Forum, guests of Dr. William Sadler and Dr. Lena Sadler, in their home at 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, Illinois.

When the first Urantia Paper was received, it was read to the group by Dr. Sadler. It was discussed and we were told to ask questions that occurred to us and hand them in at the next Sunday afternoon meeting of the Forum.

The complete revelation was completed in 1935 and consisted of 196 Papers and its Foreword. We were pledged not to discuss the subject matter of the Papers, publicly, until they were published in complete form as The Urantia Book.

The members of the Forum, in anticipation of the printing of the Book, began to contribute funds for its printing. And after many years of contributing, the need for the contributors to have an agency represent them for collecting contributions and tend to the printing of Urantia Papers as the Urantia Book, became apparent.

The usual and fair procedure would have been for the contributors to choose the members it wished to act as their agents. But, secretly, without authority from the contributors, five members, whose conceit and egotism ran ahead of their reason and evaded their logic, unfairly, in a self serving Declaration of Trust, elected themselves as the sole, exclusive, self-perpetuating, absolute controllers of everything related to the printing, publication, and dissemination of the Urantia Book and its teachings.

When they published the Urantia Book, they applied, with a sworn affidavit, applying for registration of the copyright, claiming that the Urantia Foundation was the author of the Urantia Book. Everyone who had read the Urantia Book, knew that that was a false claim, and that the Urantia Foundation was not the author of the Urantia Book.

When a sworn application for registration of copyright comes to the Copyright Office, it does not question the veracity of the sworn application but registers the claim, gives claimant a number, and issues a certificate of copyright.

The Urantia Foundation, having thus illegally appropriated the Urantia Revelation from the Public Realm, set up an un-Urantian, autocratic organization, claiming to have a holy mission with divine authority to dictate and censor all other religious groups and believers who might wish to spread the Urantia Book and its teachings.

Instead of devoting itself to freely sharing the Urantia Revelation with the world, as the revelators intended, the 533 organization has devoted its activities to maintaining its authority and to prosecuting sincere believers who dared to quote the Urantia Book without the censorship and permission of 533 dictators.

We have faith that right makes might, and with that faith we are confident that ultimately right will prevail.
