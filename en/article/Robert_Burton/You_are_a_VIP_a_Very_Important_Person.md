The Spirit of God indwells your mind and the Spirit of Jesus dwells in your hearts. You are never alone. We are all children of God. We are all kin, in the Family of God.

> “There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domain, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career attainment. The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! Whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of the indwelling spirit of God and on the guidance of that good spirit of the Universe Son, which so freely has been poured out upon all flesh.” <a id="a16_699"></a>[UB 32:5.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7)

Each one of us is equally important in the Universe. Each one of us has a contribution to make not only to the lives of those about us but for the progress of the entire Universe. There is no one that can do just what you can do.

> “You have been given many gifts and one of them is a unique personality, an exclusive and unique pattern of identity. Your personal identity is forever changeless in this constantly changing world and Universe. No other person can match your finger prints or render the special services you can do for God and humanity.” <a id="a20_323"></a>[UB 42:12.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_9)

> “Personality is unique, absolutely unique; it is unique in time and space; it is unique in eternity and on Paradise; it is unique when bestowed – there are no duplicates; it is unique during every moment of existence.” <a id="a22_221"></a>[UB 112:0.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_12)

> “Down through the ages has come God’s supreme admonition: ‘Be you perfect even as I am perfect.’ And Jesus said, ‘Be you perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.’” <a id="a24_175"></a>[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3)

> “To help us in our progress toward perfection God has given each of us a fragment of himself that lives in each of our minds and is exclusively engaged in co-ordinating our thoughts and urging us to do the best we know.” <a id="a26_223"></a>[UB 116:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p7_2) <a id="a26_267"></a>[UB 1:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_4)

> “Jesus said: “By your faith and the spirit’s transformation, you become in reality the temples of God, and his spirit actually dwells within you.” <a id="a28_149"></a>[UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4)

> “The indwelling Spirit of God remains with you in all disaster and through every sickness which does not wholly destroy the mentality. But how unkind knowingly to defile or otherwise deliberately to pollute the physical body, which must serve as the earthly tabernacle of this marvelous gift from God. All physical poisons greatly retard the efforts of this indwelling spirit to exalt the material mind, while the mental poisons of fear, anger, envy, jealousy, suspicion, and intolerance likewise tremendously interfere with the spiritual progress of the evolving soul.” <a id="a30_573"></a>[UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5)

> “The success of your Adjuster in the enterprise of helping you through the mortal life and bringing about your survival depends not so much on the theories of your belief as upon your decisions, determinations, and steadfast faith.” No one in the Universe is permitted to interfere with our freedom of choice. It is our sacred right and our responsibility to make our own decisions in choosing the right or the wrong. And we have spiritual help if we will listen. <a id="a32_466"></a>[UB 110:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_2)

> Jesus said: “When my children become self-conscious o f the assurance of the divine presence, such a faith will expand the mind, ennoble the soul, reinforce the personality, augment the happiness, deepen the spirit perception, and enhance the power to love and be loved.” <a id="a34_274"></a>[UB 159:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_12)

> “Jesus lived on earth and taught a gospel that redeemed man from the superstition that he was a child of the devil and elevated him to the dignity of a faith son of God.” <a id="a36_173"></a>[UB 194:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1)

> “Jesus’ message as he preached it and lived it in his day, was an effective solvent for man’s spiritual difficulties in that day of its statement. And now that he has personally left the world, he has sent his Spirit of Truth, who is living in man and, for each new generation, restates the Jesus message so that every new group of mortals to appear upon the face of the earth shall have a new and up-to-date version of the gospel, just such personal enlightenment and group guidance as will prove to be an effective solvent for man’s ever new and varied spiritual difficulties.” <a id="a38_582"></a>[UB 194:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1)

> “This Holy Spirit of Truth, guides and comforts men and eventually leads them to all truth. This Spirit strengthens your inner soul by the constant renewing of your minds. It makes the doing of the will of God a pleasure and gives you faith in God’s great and precious promises.” <a id="a40_282"></a>[UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4)

> “There truly exists within you a conspiracy of spiritual forces, a confederation of divine powers, whose exclusive purpose is to effect your final deliverance from material bondage and finite handicaps.” <a id="a42_206"></a>[UB 34:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_9)

> You are not given truth to crystallize into settled, safe, and honored forms. Your revelation of truth must be so enhanced by passing through your personal experience that new beauty and actual spiritual gains will be disclosed to all who behold your spiritual fruits and in consequence thereof are led to glorify the Father who is in heaven.” <a id="a44_346"></a>[UB 176:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_7)

> “There is only one gift man can make to God, that is the dedication of his will to the doing of the will of God.” <a id="a46_116"></a>[UB 112:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_10)

> “Your spiritual destiny is conditioned only by your longings and purposes.” <a id="a48_78"></a>[UB 156:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_9)

> “Do not be discouraged by the discovery that you are human.” <a id="a50_63"></a>[UB 156:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_8)

> “The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Spirit of God that dwells within the human mind.” <a id="a52_138"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34)

> “Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saving, ‘This is the way.’” <a id="a54_451"></a>[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)

> “Jesus was the perfectly unified personality. And today as in Galilee, he continues to unify mortal experience and to co-ordinate human endeavors. He unifies life, ennobles character, and simplifies experience. He enters the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it. It is literally true: ‘If any man has Christ Jesus within him, he is a new creature; old things are passing away, behold all things are becoming new.’” <a id="a56_433"></a>[UB 100:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_18)

> “To ‘Follow Jesus’ means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the Master’s life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” <a id="a58_436"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3)

The Urantia Book contains many times as much of the life an teachings of Jesus as does the Bible. It increases an appreciation of the religious wisdom and spiritual truths contained in the Bible. It opens new vistas of time and eternity, new concepts of man’s ever ascending adventure of finding God the Father.

Very truly for diligence in freely sharing the teachings of the Urantia Book with the people of all nations.

Robert Burton
