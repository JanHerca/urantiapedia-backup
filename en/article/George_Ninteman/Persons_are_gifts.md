At least Jesus thought so. “Father, I want those you have given me to be where I am.” I agree with Jesus... and I also want those whom the Father has given me to be where I am. Persons are gifts which the Father sends to me wrapped. Some are wrapped very beautifully. They are very attractive when I first see them. Some come in very ordinary wrapping paper. Others have been mishandled in the mail, Once in a while there is a “Special Delivery,” Some persons are gifts which come loosely wrapped, others very tightly. But the wrapping is not the gift. It is easy to make this mistake; it's amusing when babies do it. Sometimes the gift is easy to open up. Sometimes I need others to help. Is it because they are afraid? Does it hurt? Maybe they have been opened up before and thrown away. Could it be that the gift is not for me? I am a person. Therefore l am a gift, too. A gift for myself because first of all the Father gave myself to me. Have I ever really looked inside the wrappings? Am I afraid to? Perhaps I've never accepted the gift that I am. Could it be that there is something else inside the wrappings than what I think there is. Maybe I've never seen the wonderful gift that I am? Could the Father's gifts be anything but beautiful? I love the gifts which those who love me give me, why not this gift from the Father? And I am a gift to other persons. Am I willing to be given by the Father to others? ... a man for others? Do others have to be content with the wrappings?... never permitted to enjoy the gift? Every meeting of persons is the exchange of gifts. But a gift without a giver is not a gift, it is a thing devoid of relationship. Friendship is a relationship between persons who see themselves as they truly are: gifts of the Father to each other for others ...brothers. A friend is a gift not just to me, but to others through me... When I keep my friend, possess him, I destroy his “giftness.” If I save his life for me, I lose it for others. Persons are gifts, gifts received and gifts given, like the Son, like the Spirit, gifts from the Father. Friendship is the response of persons; gifts to the Father, the Giver.
