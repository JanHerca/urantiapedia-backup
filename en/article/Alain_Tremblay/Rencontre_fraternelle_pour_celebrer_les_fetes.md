Dear friends, It is with great pleasure that I write to you about a friendly and fraternal meeting experienced recently as the holidays approach. Indeed, on December 15, a festive dinner was held at the Harmonie Resource Center in Les Laurentides, bringing together 16 people. Among them were some members of the AUQ executive, the “Discovery” study group as well as readers of the _Urantia Book_ and their spouses. In a setting offering a panoramic view of the forest and the gentle atmosphere of a fireplace, a succulent Quebec-style meal was served to us. This warm and welcoming context was conducive to many captivating exchanges as well as meeting new readers.

The organizer, Mrs. Claudette Gonthier, secretary of the association, summed up the objective of this meeting well in the following terms: “We are part of the beautiful big family of Urantia. Coming together in a spirit of love, fraternity and sharing our joys at this Christmas dinner allows us to strengthen our belonging as spiritual brothers and sisters. May this dinner make us grow spiritually together and may this fraternal meeting strengthen our bonds._” Mission accomplished with much happiness, gratitude and beautiful memories!

Furthermore, after the meal, we were able to attend the presentation of the year's report by the president, Mr. Gaétan Charland. The latter presented the various achievements and projections for the future of the executive in terms of management, involvement and influence of the _Urantia Book_, and this, more particularly among younger readers. This was followed by a presentation of the many resources available to help the reader such as The Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS), The Progressive Divine Wisdom School, The Ambassadors School, and other resources accessible to readers.

As “Christmas gifts”, a few books were drawn. To add to the fun and participation, an essential work [^1] on climate change, written by Gilles Brien, the Association's weatherman, was put up for auction!

To conclude this beautiful meeting, some will say that “singing is praying twice”, so we sang some Quebec songs and Christmas hymns under the direction of Gilles Brien on guitar accompanied by Robert Cadieux. A version adapted by Robert with the revelations of the _Urantia Book_ of Midnight Christian is worth presenting here:

“_Hello, Christian, it is the solemn hour_
_Where the God-man came down to us_
_To reveal the love of Our Father_
_And proclaim the kingdom of heaven_
_The whole world trembles with hope_
_Because today we give him a savior_
_People stand up, affirm your lineage_
_Christmas! Christmas! Jesus is among us!_
_Christmas, Christmas! With the Spirit of Truth_ ”

On these notes :musical_score: :guitar: can be bought in shopping centers, but which we need so much: joyful and happy moments with your loved ones, kindness, gentleness, courage, health and throughout the next year, the indescribable peace of our God of Love.
