<p>Favorite Places: The Way Jesus Taught</p>
<p>This was his method of instruction: Never once did he attack their errors or even mention the flaws in their teachings. In each case he would select the truth in what they taught and then proceed so to embellish and illuminate this truth in their minds that in a very short time this enhancement of the truth effectively crowded out the associated error; (1456)</p>
<p>Always the burden of his message was: the fact of the heavenly Father’s love and the truth of his mercy, coupled with the good news that man is a faith-son of this same God of love. (1460)</p>
<p>To Ganid: “If we could have him live with us, we might by our lives show him the Father in heaven, and thus would he become so attracted by our lives as sons of God that he would be constrained to inquire about our Father. You cannot reveal God to those who do not seek for him; you cannot lead unwilling souls into the joys of salvation. Man must become hungry for truth as a result of the experiences of living, or he must desire to know God as the result of contact with the lives of those who are acquainted with the divine Father before another human being can act as the means of leading such a fellow mortal to the Father in heaven. If we know God, our real business on earth is so to live as to permit the Father to reveal himself in our lives, and thus will all God-seeking persons see the Father and ask for our help in finding out more about the God who in this manner finds expression in our lives.” (1466)</p>
<p>Jesus did not attack the teachings of the Hebrew prophets or the Greek moralists. The Master recognized the many good things which these great teachers stood for, but he had come down to earth to teach something additional, “the voluntary conformity of man’s will to God’s will.”  (1582)</p>
<p>Jesus had little to say about the social vices of his day; seldom did he make reference to moral delinquency. He was a positive teacher of true virtue. He studiously avoided the negative method of imparting instruction; he refused to advertise evil. He was not even a moral reformer. He well knew, and so taught his apostles, that the sensual urges of mankind are not suppressed by either religious rebuke or legal prohibitions. His few denunciations were largely directed against pride, cruelty, oppression, and hypocrisy. (1582)</p>
<p>Jesus answered: &quot;Simon, Simon, how many times have I instructed you to refrain from all efforts to take something out of the hearts of those who seek salvation? How often have I told you to labor only to put something into these hungry souls? Lead men into the kingdom, and the great and living truths of the kingdom will presently drive out all serious error. (1592)</p>
<p>Do not strive with men—always be patient. It is not your kingdom; you are only ambassadors. Simply go forth proclaiming: This is the kingdom of heaven—God is your Father and you are his sons, and this good news, if you wholeheartedly believe it, is your eternal salvation. (1592)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Always respect the personality of man. Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force; spiritual victories can be won only by spiritual power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overpowering arguments and mental superiority are not to be employed to coerce men and women into the kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man’s mind is not to be crushed by the mere weight of logic or overawed by shrewd eloquence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While emotion as a factor in human decisions cannot be wholly eliminated, it should not be directly appealed to in the teachings of those who would advance the cause of the kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your appeals directly to the divine spirit that dwells within the minds of men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not appeal to fear, pity, or mere sentiment. In appealing to men, be fair; exercise self-control and exhibit due restraint; show proper respect for the personalities of your pupils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In bringing men into the kingdom, do not lessen or destroy their self-respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forget not that I will stop at nothing to restore self-respect to those who have lost it, and who really desire to regain it. (1765)</p>

<p>He frequently set out to help a person by asking for help. In this way he elicited interest, appealed to the better things in human nature. (1875)</p>
<p>Most of the really important things which Jesus said or did seemed to happen casually, “as he passed by.” There was so little of the professional, the well-planned, or the premeditated in the Master’s earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, “He went about doing good.”</p>
<p>And it behooves the Master’s followers in all ages to learn to minister as “they pass by”—to do unselfish good as they go about their daily duties. (1875)</p>
