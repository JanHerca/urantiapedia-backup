Under the name “Grow Godward,” the International Conference (IC'14) of the Urantia Book Fellowship was held this summer. I attended a preconference retreat on contemplative prayer and meditation. There was a feeling of trust and belonging that developed among the participants. I experienced five days of the kind of love that flows so naturally from our Father to us. The feeling was so present in everybody and everywhere that it was impossible not to see or feel or share it.

> “Mortal man cannot possibly know the infinitude of the heavenly Father. Finite mind cannot think through such an absolute truth or fact. But this same finite human being can actually feel—literally experience—the full and undiminished impact of such an infinite Father's LOVE”. <a id="a45_280"></a>[UB 3:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p4_6)

I had never attended such a big conference in my life. I was amazed. First, because of the incredible quality of the organization, and second, because there were so many people assembled for the same purpose, for the same cause, which motivates us to keep working on ourselves in order to allow this feeling and energy to be part of our daily lives.

During the conference it was possible to choose from a number of simultaneouslyrunning workshops. Much music was provided at the conference every morning and most evenings. It was impressive, beautiful, and inspiring, and it preceded worship. Group worship was held at the morning and evening meditation sessions. Every time was a pleasure, and was, as we say in Peru, “un regalo del cielo” (a present from heaven).

> “Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures.” <a id="a51_259"></a>[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1)

I often wonder after a gathering like this what we do when we go back home? How do we take these experiences and this energy and apply them and spread them in our daily lives? First, I think we have to start with ourselves. How? According to this quote on worship, we can start by cultivating our relationship with our Father, this connection with our Thought Adjusters. In my experience I disciplined myself to engage in prayerful, worshipful meditation. With time, it became a beautiful habit, which now is impossible to break. This is the first step in growing Godward. Each person must find his or her own way to take this first step. We are, after all, different, and we know our Father likes diversity. Events like IC'14 help us to remember that our main purpose in life is to love one another as our Father loves us.

IC'14 was organized by the Urantia Book Fellowship and was sponsored by Urantia Foundation and Truthbook.com. The feeling of brotherhood among the participants was very strong. It was inspiring to see all of these people working together to spread the Urantia Revelation around the world. I hope that the future will afford us opportunities to use the resources of each organization and their members to keep working for the same cause and purpose. It was an honor to be a part of it, and I thank everyone who made this event possible.
