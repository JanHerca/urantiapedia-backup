Virtual study groups of _The Urantia Book_ are growing in popularity and provide a valuable option for those without a local meeting of readers.

One of the first virtual study groups of _The Urantia Book_ to take wing on the Internet, Symmetry of Soul (SoS) has featured in-depth broadcasts since September 1, 2010. Originally launched with three co-hosts, Ann Garner, Dr. Chris Halvorson, and James Woodward, the program soon recruited one of its early supporters, Kermit Anderson. Each of the four co-hosts brings their unique personality and perspective to the weekly sessions, but Dr. Halvorson, who has led a well-attended study group in Boulder, Colorado, for the last 20 years, skillfully directs the systematic “unpacking” of the revelation.

The Symmetry of Soul program is broadcast live for two hours every Tuesday at 9:00 pm ET (6:00 pm PT) by BlogTalkRadio, a very popular Internet company that allows anyone, from famous media stars to everyday folks, to create their own modern-day version of a radio show. To listen to and/or join in the study, go to [www.symmetryofsoul.org](http://www.symmetryofsoul.org/) or [www.blogtalkradio.com/symmetryofsoul](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/symmetryofsoul).

The home Website, [www.symmetryofsoul.org](http://www.symmetryofsoul.org/), is managed by the SoS team, dedicated to archiving the broadcasts and the weekly reviews compiled by Anderson. It also features introductory bios of the four co-hosts. Although the BlogTalk site does store the broadcasts, the team wanted to ensure the preservation of the instructive sessions and make it easier for students to find a particular program of interest.

The Symmetry of Soul introduction from the Website states the virtual study group is “a weekly study of the unifying concepts of _The Urantia Book_, mindful of the threefold nature of the cosmos: ‘philosophy, religion, and science are welded into a meaningful unity by the conjoined action of wisdom, faith, and experience.’ Our exploration follows a study group pattern of topical inquiry, moderated discussion, and citations from _The Urantia Book_.”

Symmetry of Soul follows a topical format, and many intriguing topics from _The Urantia Book_ have been the subject of study. Most recently the focus has been on Machiventa Melchizedek—exploring his emergency bestowal in depth, including the influence of his teachings upon all the major religions of the world. Another program arc, one that spanned sixty-four episodes, was a thorough study of all five epochal revelations to Urantia.

Serious students of _The Urantia Book_ and new readers as well are encouraged to listen live to the weekly study and avail themselves of past shows stored in the archives. Listeners may also register for the live chat room that features its own discussions, questions, and the posting of the text being studied. Readers can call in during the show with questions as well.

Symmetry of Soul offers a fun and instructive medium moderated by devoted students. Those who want to really “unpack” the truth, beauty, and goodness of the Fifth Epochal Revelation are invited to check it out!
