I’m not likely to forget an encounter this unique: 
an epiphany is emerging from my interface 
with the boundaries of Little Lake Shawnee, 
a natural lake for children, our little ones, 
drained while improvements are made. 

Stones, uniformly carved and faithfully fitted 
to this tiny lake’s old shoreline 
form a collar-colored wall, a boundary 
four feet high. 

Coincidentally perhaps, I’ve been pushing 
the envelope of my collared mind 
to explore the expanding boundaries of the evolving God, 
One that grows by embracing and becoming 
the experience of each and every one of us 
in our cornucopic encounters with each other. 

And now, this encounter with a wall, 
intelligently crafted, though unaware of me 
as I tightrope along the edge of it 
to an unfinished spot where there is no wall 
—a 60-foot gap, intended 
for some purpose I don’t comprehend. 

I sense an unspoken promise in that unknown purpose, 
one self-similar to the greater Mystery I’ve been stalking 
as It emerges, self-aware and with holy purpose. 

I believe I’m emerging as well, 
which may explain why I see promise in mystery, 
whereas, in my youth, as a little one, 
I trembled at unknown gaps. 

The next time I visit this part of the park 
I expect I’ll see this puzzle solved. 
Not so with the Mystery that is the evolving God, 
an enigma born at the dawn of time and space 
and promising not to be fully revealed 
until eons from now. 

We have a choice to remain in this unfolding mystery 
sometimes draining ourselves while improvements are made 
fearlessly exploring the supreme intelligence behind the wall, 
all the while being gifted to know 
we are the little ones, and God keeps his promises.
