<p style="text-align:center;">
Toast with me what humankind will be <br>
an evolution of heart, hand and brain <br>
from today. I envy our begotten <br>
seventy times seven generations <br>
paid forward. Just as high, let's lift our mugs <br>
to brothers and sisters who, with us, blazed <br>
this planet's trail with courage and cunning. <br>
I trust as we traverse the mansion worlds <br>
that fringe the fulcrum of infinity,<br>
nourishing our souls with lessons learned <br>
from fellow pilgrims born on countless spheres, <br>
the day will dawn when we will hear the news —<br>
our sons and daughters back on Earth have breached <br>
the outer limits of their D N A <br>
to plot their soul-paths straight toward Paradise.<br>
Then I will pause to glance about the hills<br>
of Salvington, recall the promise of <br>
Melchizedek — of seed to populate<br>
the stars — and muse about that dawn when light <br>
will grant me my next grand epiphany.<br>
