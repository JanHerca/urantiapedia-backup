The Foreign Extension Committee of the Urantia Brotherhood feels t hat no activities equal the importance of Urantian believers coming together in the study of these supernal teachings. To support and encourage individuals outside the United States who are so motivated, is the duty and function of our committee. We are kept abreast of interest in the Urantia Book in foreign lands by receiving copies of the correspondence going out from Headquarters.

While group activity is most encouraging in Finland, we have reason to suppose there are one or more groups in Canada, France, Australia, and most recently Costa Rica.

Bernard Burton- Chairman
