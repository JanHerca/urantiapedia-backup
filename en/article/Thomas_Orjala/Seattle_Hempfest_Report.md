_By Thomas Orjala, Idaho, United States_

For the fourth year running I attended the Seattle Hempfest with my partner, Aurora Hill, and sister, Janet Orjala. Urantia Foundation donated books to this effort. This festival, which celebrated its 28th year in 2019, took place August 16-18 at Myrtle Edwards Park on the city's waterfront. It is the largest of its kind in the world and draws tens of thousands of attendees.

What stands out about this event is the openness of the young people who stop by the booth. Many are thrilled to hear such a book exists. When I was 20 years old, I discovered _The Urantia Book_ while exploring my inner hippie in San Francisco. The combination of being truth hungry and having my mind expand with herbal helpers prepared me to recognize the spiritual value of the book when I first laid eyes on it. It turns out there are still many young people just like me who are seeking answers for how to live a positive, more spiritual life on this confused planet

This year we placed 71 books, most going to people under 30. Our goal is to place 500 books in the Seattle area. To date we have placed almost 300 books in the first four years thanks to help from Urantia Foundation, the Fellowship, and private donors. We hope to go back next year.

May Seattle once again become a shining light of Urantia Revelation activities, as it was not so long ago.
