Sean has been Chair of the YaYA Committee since July 2018. He took over when a large group of YaYAs were cycling out and transitioning to the daily life of careers and family. In November 2018 the YaYAs sponsored a trip to the Parliament of World Religions in Toronto. This is always a great experience, even with that time of year

being cold and wet in Toronto! We rented two houses and there was a large Urantia presence at the Parliament. Many of the attendees volunteered at the Parliament. This past April the YaYAs went to Denver for a weekend retreat where we rented a house and had A LOT of young kids show up, which is always fun.

Last year started the planning for a large undertaking that culminated in a trip to Estonia for a YaYA/UYAI (Urantia Youth Association International) co-hosted retreat this past July. There was a group of Americans and Europeans from all over. This retreat led up to the larger conference in Tallinn. We rented out a giant room with 20 beds at a hostel, right in the heart of the city and the retreat ran for 3 days before the conference.

The goal for the rest of 2019 and 2020 is for continued retreats and community building regionally. If you have an idea or would like a youth retreat near you just reach out! The next large event will be a pre-retreat before the Vancouver BC conference July 2020. The longer term goal is to go to Peru in 2021!
