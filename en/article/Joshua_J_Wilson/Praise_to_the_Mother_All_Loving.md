Praise to the Mother, All-Loving, the God of creation!
O my soul, praise Her, for She is your health and salvation!
All you who hear, now to Her temple draw near;
Praise Her in glad adoration.

Praise to the Mother, o'er all things so wondrously reigning,
Shelters you under Her wings, yes, so gently sustaining.
Have you not seen how your desires all have been
Granted in what she ordaineth?

Praise to the Mother, who prospers your work and defends you,
Surely her goodness and mercy here daily attend you;
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,
If with Her love She befriend you.

Praise to the Mother, let all that is in me adore Her!
All that has life and breath, come now with praises before Her,
Let the Amen sound from Her people again,
Gladly for yes, we adore Her.

_Original German words by Joachim Neander, 1680_
_Music, Lobe den Herren, 1665_
