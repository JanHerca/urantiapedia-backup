We read of many admirable human beings in _The URANTIA Book_, but my favorite has always been the apostle Andrew. While I can respect his innate intelligence and administrative ability, I am most drawn to that quality of human understanding that he possessed; and I am convinced that this was his most outstanding character achievement.

Perhaps because he understood them so well, Andrew was an expert judge of men. In the most momentous decision of his life, he approached Jesus and offered to follow him, before Jesus even asked him. Immediately thereafter, he brought Simon Peter to Jesus and was responsible for keeping him with the apostolic corps, Andrew was the only apostle to suspect that there was a problem with Judas long before the actual betrayal. But “_Andrew's great service to the kingdom was in advising Peter, James, and John concerning the choice of the first missionaries... and also in counseling these early leaders about the organization of the administrative affairs of the kingdom._” (<a id="a35_674"></a>[UB 139:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_8))

I have often wondered if Andrew ever regretted not being able to enjoy the close companionship with Jesus that Peter, James and John had, If so, there is no evidence of it. He consistently demonstrated patience; he was stable, a well-rounded personality.

And he must have been easy to talk to. The apostles sought his counsel and guidance frequently. Someday I would like to talk to Andrew myself, and I look forward to meeting him during the morontia career.
