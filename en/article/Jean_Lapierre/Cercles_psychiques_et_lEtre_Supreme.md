This document relates to the psychic circles (Paper 110:6) and their relationship to what is important to master them. I believe that the mastery of these circles has been largely misunderstood and this is due, I think, to our Judeo-Christian monotheistic heritage where the emphasis was placed only on God the Universal Father, the Source Center of All. This monotheism was good because it allowed the cleansing of a host of gods: it was anarchy. However, we must not make monotheism a dogma because that would obscure in particular the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, the existential Trinity, the two experiential deities, etc.

On a material world and also on the worlds of houses, the conquest of the seven psychic circles concerns the potential for spiritual growth of a personality before its fusion. We deduce that this conquest of the seven circles can also be done on our material world, that is to say, reach the first psychic circle (the fusion could also be done, but it is very exceptional at present). In this booklet, however, we are told that an individual of the seventh circle can know God and be conscious of his filiation with Him as well as the one who is in the first circle.

But what is the salient element that advances an individual from the seventh to the first psychic circle? We are taught that individuals in the lower circles (seventh and sixth) are much less conscious of their experiential relationship with the Supreme Being, that is, of their cosmic citizenship. In other words, persons in the higher circles grasp the meanings and realize the values of a progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of existence, of an embryonic relationship between the morontia soul and the as yet unfinished Supreme Being. We are told that the seven adjutants who had a growing influence on the human mind from the seventh to the third circle, are now of diminishing influence, and their ministry from the first circle onward may be said to be increasingly akin to the intelligence of the morontia stage.

We can thus conclude that ascenders having reached the seventh or sixth circle at their physical death, will have to make on the worlds of the houses this increasing quantitative experience in the understanding of the supreme meanings and values that their colleagues of the material worlds had already accomplished on their native planet.

All this does not take anything away from the Universal Father but on the contrary allows us to know and understand Him more through experience and I explain. The Universal Father (the First Source Center) being Absolute and Infinite, therefore, we can only realize our filiation with Him (impossibility of understanding Him). A divine plan fortunately allows us a gradual approach to the knowledge and understanding of the Universal Father. This plan includes great levels of experiential approach, the first of which is that of supremacy which will be realized when our Mother, God the Supreme, will be completed. This experiential approach to knowing and understanding the Universal Father will always continue to be realized in subsequent universe ages with our Mother because she will be part of the first experiential Trinity to understand God as Ultimate, the second experiential Trinity to understand God as Absolute, and the Trinity of Trinities toward a gradual but still incomplete understanding of the infinity of God (all of this is well revealed in Paper 106).
