By Barry D. Bradley

Readers and visitors alike can now explore _The Urantia Book_ on the World Wide Web, a section of the Internet being searched and examined by an estimated 20 million people around the world. And that number is increasing significantly every day.

Through the work of David Kantor, chairman of the Special Projects Committee of the Fellowship, along with fellow Californians Mark Turrin, Larry Watkins and Sage Waitts in Oregon, the Fellowship Web site is drawing hundreds of new visitors each day.

“Ithink it's very successful,” says Kantor. “The part I like is that access is growing 25 percent a month ... and the majority have not heard of (_The Urantia Book_).”

The new Web site is being visited by nearly 300 people per day, with an average visit time of five pages each. In addition, the Fellowship is getting up to 10 e-mail inquiries each day that are responded to by Fellowship volunteers who have access to the Internet.

The URL address is http://www.ubfellowship.org and can be accessed (without the brackets) through any Internet connection. (By the way, URL stands for Universal Resource Locator, and can be found on your Internet Home Page). Not only is the site comprehensive and informative, it is very fast, allowing for easy downloading. There's even a search engine for words or phrases within _The Urantia Book_. There's also an extensive archive of papers and photographs that will enhance your study.

Following is a sampling of responses from those on the Internet:

“I have just found you on the Internet. I am a resident of Juneau, Alaska and have read some of _The Urantia Book_ a few years ago. I have recently rediscovered my views of the universe and find that I need to pick up where I left in the book. I would like to find anyone also interested in the book here in Juneau.”

“We are a newly formed group in Guayaquil, Ecuador interested in the study of this incredible book. We would like to know if this is the proper channel for any Q&A we might have.”

“The book says Gabriel and Melchizedek are never away from HQ at the same time, but it also says Jesus was talking with them at the same time on Urantia. Why the contradiction?”

“I have recently discovered the book. I find it totally incredible. My journey to this point has taken me through many paths. One being the Pleiadians. Do you feel there is any connection between them and the book? Please excuse me if this has been asked before or there is information in the book about this.”

“Tell me about the love of Jesus and our relationship with him. I'm already a long time UB reader who'd like a little inspiration in a spiritually desolate time in my life. Thanks.”

“Please give me information on who wrote _The Urantia Book_, where it was found and in what language was the original written.”

“I am amazed to find _The Urantia Book_ on the Interet. I had no idea there would be such a thing on the subject of salvation. I was just handed this big blue book by a friend of mine years ago with little or no attachment as to whether or not I looked at it. I read the life of Jesus and was taken by it literally. That was over five years ago. I would like to find a compelling reason to get back to it.”
