Question Time


1. It is a fact of observation that the "Teaching Mission" penetrated deeply into the Urantia movement. By Teaching Mission, we mean the use by groups, of individuals with "special powers" to act as go-betweens for celestial teachers.

A seemingly valid question to ask is whether this phenomenon took off to the extent it did because of the frustration of many individual readers in not obtaining what they felt was adequate guiding contact from their Thought Adjusters? And whether the experience of some might have been different if they had followed the advice in the book and simply got to work to increase their knowledge of Jesus?

2. Questioner: "I would love to believe in The Urantia Book. Nothing would please me more. But how can I when it contains so much that seems to be unbelievable to the modern world?

Answer: The importance of the "unbelievable stuff" may be that if your real motive is to reject what you fear might be the book's revelatory material, then you will find what you seekâ€”and your free will is preserved. Contrariwise, if you have no hidden motive compelling you to reject the book and its teachings, then be assured that, if you seek, you will find what you seek.
