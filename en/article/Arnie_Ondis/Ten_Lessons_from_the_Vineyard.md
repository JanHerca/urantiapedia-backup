The 7th Annual Emerald Coast Metaphysical Festival, which took place March 21–22 in Navarre, Florida presented a wonderful opportunity for me to share the Urantia revelation with others. I would like to share with you some of the lessons—values— that I experienced along the way, in the hope that this may be helpful to you when you are presented with opportunities to promote _The Urantia Book_. 

Having grown up in South Florida, I am very aware that this part of our state is uncharted territory for most of our population. But don’t let that fool you. We are a gigantic beacon of light in a field that is very fertile. 

## LESSON 1: Know where you are 

The Emerald Coast, particularly the Gulf Breeze, Pensacola, Navarre, and Ft. Walton Beach areas, was a hotbed of UFO activity that started in the late 80’s and lasted for about 10 years. Just Google “Gulf Breeze UFOs” and see what that fetches. There were hundreds of sightings by thousands of people. If a resident didn’t experience a direct sighting, he or she knew someone who did. This brought to our area UFO investigators along with debunkers, the chartering of a Chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and an International UFO Conference. 

## LESSON 2: Know your neighbor 

The people who witnessed the UFOs were from every educational level, every walk of life—doctors, professionals, fishermen in the Gulf―and every faith. They all experienced direct evidence that we are not alone in the universe. When the bulk of the sightings ceased, these folks were left with a deep yearning for meaning, for a new paradigm big enough to include their place in this universe that was newly opened to them. The leaders of the MUFON Chapter eventually formed a new organization, Unlimited Horizons of the Emerald Coast (UH) (www.unlimitedhorizons. org), the organizer of this Metaphysical Festival. By the way, the topic of my lecture was “_The Urantia Book_: Compelling Evidence of E.T. Contact.” 

## LESSON 3: Bear fruit in the soil in which you are planted 

One of our FSUB members, Don Ware of Fort Walton Beach, has been a driving force behind the UH organization. Don is one of those extraordinary individuals of gigantic intellect and charismatic personality who is balanced with grace and unconditional love for others. Don introduced _The Urantia Book_ to his friends and associates. He has been a real Johnny Appleseed. Most UH board members are readers of the book because of him. Don hosts a group in Fort Walton Beach, and most of the people in my group are linked to him in one way or another. At last year’s festival, Don and I sold about two boxes of books out of the trunks of our cars. People would find me and say, “Are you Arnie? Don Ware sent me.” Over the years, Don has disseminated scores, maybe hundreds, of books in our area and in many places around the world. Don is an outstanding example of what is possible for one person to do. 

## LESSON 4: Be not afraid - you are not alone 

It can be daunting to realize that you will be the standard bearer at a major event. But that needn’t paralyze you because, when following the call of Spirit, help is always provided. A few of the UH board members are friends in my study group. Who you know is important! Together, we created an opportunity to have a booth at the festival and, also, for me to be one of the featured speakers. Support was received from FSUB. Further assistance was provided by Paula Thompson at the Fellowship who arranged for sponsorship of the booth, availability of books and assorted free handouts. Paula was always there at the other end of the phone to provide wisdom, feedback, and support as I developed my lecture. My friends were there to support me every step of the way! 

## LESSON 5: Judge not 

This event draws over a thousand people from the Northwest Florida panhandle and South Alabama. There are two rooms filled with all sorts of vendors, intuitive readers, and healers. Another room serves as an auditorium for the featured speakers. To have labeled these vendors, readers, and healers in that category of “_isms and cults of a frustrated philosophic generation_” [[UB 100:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_1)] would have been a gross error of judging, and would have blinded me to the truth, meanings, and values of what they had to offer. I would not have recognized opportunities to share the book with them from common points. A practical point to remember at these metaphysical events: don’t refer to yourself as a “reader” or people may think you do psychic intuitive readings. “Student” or “reader of the book” are better descriptors. 

## LESSON 6: Ask, and all will be given to you 

Even when I was by myself at the booth, I was never alone. Angels were directing people to my booth. Thought Adjusters were doing their thing. I’m sure there were midwayers helping. The energy presence of our Divine Parents was palpable. 

## LESSON 7: Listen before speaking. 

I had to remind myself many times that I am a herald of truth, not a steamroller. The most brilliant dissertation of the book will fall on deaf ears if it doesn’t mean anything to that person or their situation. It was always helpful to learn a little about the person first, by asking such questions as, “What brings you to the festival? What are your interests?” or asking healers to “tell me about the energy you are receiving and channeling.” Find what resonates within them. That, along with leadings from Spirit, informs you on how to approach that person. 

## LESSON 8: Always give something of value to everyone you meet 

Not everyone is going to buy the book; not everyone is ready for it. But, everyone is searching for meaning, purpose—something. Everyone is searching for God. And everyone is entitled to the respect due the dignity of an ascending son of God. I was representing the friendly universe of a loving and generous God. I had to embody that grace and generosity. Everyone got something, even if it was a simple acknowledgment. Some got an ear. Some got handouts. Many got handouts about Stillness to get them started. I was electric with cosmic energy and I touched and shook hands with as many people as possible. Literally hundreds of seeds were planted. 

## LESSON 9: Don’t just catch and release - provide follow -up and support 

A total of forty-one books were sold, mostly to newcomers. Several individual vendors bought a copy for personal use (three copies went to a vendor for his shop in South Georgia), and a number of healers and intuitive readers also got copies. The speaking presentation was before a full house, close to one hundred people, and many books were sold afterward. That also led to an invitation to speak at another metaphysical festival in the fall. 

But this is just the beginning; these new readers need support. We now have a list of more than thirty persons who wish to remain in contact and need follow up. I am in the process of shepherding them individually and will be, with the help of others, forming them into study groups. Currently we have one group in Gulf Breeze/Pensacola/Navarre and one in Ft. Walton Beach/ Niceville. I expect an additional group to form in Pensacola, and new ones to form in Panama City and DeFuniak Springs. 

## LESSON 10: Give thanks. 

I could not have done this on my own. Having received so much from so many, visible and invisible, I give thanks to God. I am deeply humbled by the awesome charge to represent this revealed truth to those unsuspecting souls who were guided to us. I am especially grateful to have experienced personal exchanges with others on a deeper, more meaningful level and to have played a part in their life-transforming realizations. I have found that the outcomes from working in concert and cooperation with something greater than myself are never surprising, but always amazing! 

What are you waiting for? The harvest really is ripe. Find a venue. You are up for it and, besides, all of the help that you need will be given to you. 

If not you, then who? If not now, then when? 

Be the Light.
