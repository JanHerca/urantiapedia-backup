_By Antonio Schefer, Heerlen, the Netherlands_

Urantia Association of the Netherlands invites you to come to Europe during the early spring of 2018. From April 12 to 15, Urantia Association International is hosting its tenth international conference in the beautiful surroundings of the flower fields near Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and we want you to be there too. These international conferences happen every three years and should not be missed. They provide wonderful opportunities for social interaction and inner growth while promoting a genuine fraternity with others from many cultures.

The conference theme is “Jesus as a Teacher” and will be fully focused on our Master. Besides his spiritual education, He showed us methods on how this education is most fruitful. What can we learn from him? What do we need in the twenty-first century to be true followers of his teachings? The program will provide a platform for many international readers, and there will be attendees who have studied the book for many years who can help us learn more what the fifth epochal revelation is all about. There will be plenaries and workshops that will explore these relevant topics with an emphasis on learning by experience and by sharing in small groups.

We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible at this event. Visitors are coming from around the world, and our financial aid committee is working hard to collect funds and manage requests from readers who need financial assistance to attend this conference. If you feel inclined, please contribute to our Conference Financial Aid Fund by visiting https://urantiaassociation.org/getinvolved/donate/.

You may register for the event at http://www.uai2018.org/progr am/register/en. We also urge you to book your accommodations in the hotel now! A lot of activities take place in the region surrounding the conference venue at this time of the year, so it is very important to secure lodging early. You can book your room at https://www.nhhotels.com/event/the-10thurantia-associationinternational-conference.
