Beginning November 23, we will launch a series of free online study group sessions centered on the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. The sessions will be held weekly and will consist initially of the following modules:

- What _The Urantia Book_ teaches about in-depth study, in combination with relevant practical exercises
- Lessons on teaching and public speaking, along with opportunities for participants to deliver practice speeches
- Growing up with Jesus: How to enhance balanced growth and become leaders by learning what Jesus did at every stage of development, from early childhood to later adult life
- The truths of science in a philosophy of living: Connecting the truths of science with the new philosophy of living inspired by Jesus’ teaching on coordinating science and religion in our lives

This study group will not be solely intellectual; it’s also about growth and helping one another!
