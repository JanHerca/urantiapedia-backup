Dear Friends,

This summer the 2nd European Urantia Conference takes place in Tallinn, Estonia 11 to 14 July, 2019. The Urantia Association of Estonia has been preparing for this event in Northeast Europe. Tallinn is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Europe and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The organizers chose this city in an effort to unite Urantia Book students from all around Europe, and from abroad for the second time since 2016. The previous conference was in Budapest-Hungary and about eighty Urantia Book readers from around the world participated in that historical event.

This conference will address the theme: “Sowing Seeds” by posing questions: – How can we grow internally in spirit and externally in numbers? On Friday and Sunday the program will concentrate on spiritual growth possibilities, and on Saturday the focus will be on growing the numbers of readers. Presenters will discuss personal experiences from different countries in Europe, and from other continents—exploring how to find new readers and form new study groups. Following these presentations, the various European national groups are invited to make their own plans for finding new readers. Breakout sessions will be organized into smaller language groups, and translation materials will be available for those who do not speak English.

On Friday, July 12, after lunchtime, three optional cultural excursions are offered as part of the conference program, such as visiting the Art Museum, Estonian Sea Museum, and Tallinn Old Town excursion with guide. This event has also a European Leadership Meeting, a pre-conference organized by the young adults of the UYAI and the YaYa’s together, and a post conference with a visa-free cruise to St. Petersburg 14-16 July, organized by Finnish Urantia Book Readers for those who want to foster more friendship among Urantia Book students.
