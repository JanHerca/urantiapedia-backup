_By Isabel Reinoso, Marlene Tovar, Andres Ramírez, and Wilson León, Bogotá, Colombia_

The Urantia Association of Colombia and the Bogotá Urantia Association exhibited at the 2015 International Book Fair in Bogotá, Colombia. A two-week event for the printing and publishing industries, it was held this year from April 21 to May 4 at the Corferias-Centro de Convenciones in Bogotá, Colombia.

This was undoubtedly the best book fair in which the association has participated during recent years. Attendance was high, scheduled events were many, and the opportunity to reach thousands of people with information about _The Urantia Book_ was great.

First, we wish to thank any celestial beings, who may have been involved, for their guidance that made it possible for us to be there and to provide a service of love.

Second, we thank Urantia Foundation in Chicago, which donated 100 Spanish paperback Urantia Books. The gifted books helped us offset the costs of participating in the book fair.

Finally, we are grateful to the organizers and volunteers who supported us in the booth for fifteen days.

The results of our efforts were the following:

- More than 8,500 flyers were distributed.
- Information about _The Urantia Book_ was given directly to more than 2,000 people.
- More than 240 email addresses were collected from people interested in Urantia activities.
- More than 140 copies of EI libro de Urantia were sold.
- Three presentations about _The Urantia Book_ were attended by more than 100 people.

The most gratifying part of attending this book fair was the personal contact we had with the visitors to our booth. Many were exposed to the book for the first time, but some had encountered it before. The enthusiasm of so many young people gladdened our hearts.

In preparation for the fair next year, we shall do the following:

- Have a data phone to process credit cards.
- Request a better location with more booth space.
- Participate in the business conferences.
- Participate in more workshops.
- Do more promotion.
- Give mini-lectures in the booth.
- Have a children's corner with puzzles.
- Serve coffee and water.
- Improve our techniques on how to approach visitors.
- Improve the flyers.

It was our privilege and great pleasure to tend the booth and be of service to visitors.
