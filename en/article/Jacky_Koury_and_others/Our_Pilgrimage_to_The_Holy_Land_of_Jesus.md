Given this is a shared article I will briefly include two highlights of a most amazing and memorable trip I had with TEAM Jesus.

One highlight of our trip was being personally accompanied by Eli Shukron to view his recent discovery believed to be the standing stone of Melchizedek, in an area he refers to as “Temple Zero.” Eli is a most respected archaeologist in Jerusalem credited with many discoveries. He led the four of us underground and unlocked a box built to protect the stone. He pointed out discoveries surrounding this standing stone that are clues to the history of this find. We showed such great interest and enthusiasm for all that he shared as we each curiously carried our Melchizedek bags designed by Rick and Susan Lyon. This along with Diane's charming and playful personality had Eli having such a great time he ended up spending the whole day showing us around his various archaeological discoveries.

A very special sunny afternoon was spent along the Sea of Galilee in a newly discovered place called Magdala. Work was about to begin to build a retreat center by the Sea when two feet below the surface an entire town was found. One of the most well preserved first century synagogues was discovered here, along with the remains of a once prosperous fish processing industry. Coins dated 29 CE were found inside the synagogue. A most outstanding archaeological discovery is the Magdala Stone. Carved in stone is the oldest menorah, as well as the only Chariot of Fire found in Israel. I was fascinated by the top side of the stone that had a large rosette consisting of six petals surrounded by six identical petals. The Magdala Rose symbolism is still a mystery. All the symbols on the stone are related to the Second Temple. I'm fond of a Magdala Rose necklace I purchased there.

The mosaics in Magdala are some of the most well-preserved we saw on our tour. Nearby is a spirituality center for visitors, _The Duc In Altum_ completed in 2014 which houses _The Women's Atrium_. Here we learned the meaning of eight marble pillars, seven of which represent women in the Bible who followed Jesus, while the eighth honors women of faith across all time. In an adjacent room there is an impressive muralsized painting titled, “Encounter,” which movingly depicts the true story of the hemorrhaging woman who touches Jesus' hem while he walks among a crowd of men.

By her faith she knows she is healed. Our young Magdala tour guide told an accurate story of “Encounter” with love and compassion all gathered from reading the Bible.

One of my favorite parts of the trip was experiencing the Sea of Galilee. This natural inland “sea” is not only a uniquely beautiful body of water, it also provides a compelling focus for much of Jesus's life and his work with the apostles. Actually, visiting the relevant locations has been a great help for me in visualizing the story of his life and his eventful association with the apostles.

The feeling in the air, the varied terrain, and a sense of the distances they would travel on foot, have all contributed to my comprehension and appreciation of the robust character of their day-to-day life.

A high point of the trip, for me, was our group reading from Paper 140, The Ordination of the Twelve, while enjoying the warmth of the morning sunlight on a beautiful outdoor terrace at the Church of the Beatitudes, above Capernaum. With the light filtering through the trees of the park-like setting, and a view of the Sea of Galilee below, it was not hard to imagine and share the apostles' experience as we read and pondered the words of Jesus from that unforgettable day so long ago.

One of the most dramatic and emotional examples of an experience from the trip bringing life to my understanding of Jesus is directly related to the unusual characteristics of the Sea of Galilee. The midwayers tell us that Jesus experienced great sorrow and loneliness during the evening of his arrest, as he thought about the impending separation from his apostles, his isolation from his family, and the rejection of his mission by his father Joseph's people.

We then learn that Jesus was able to soothe himself with old memories of pleasant scenes from his earthly life, including the sunrises and sunsets on “the shimmering Sea of Galilee.” The recall of these memories gave him comfort “as he made his human heart strong and ready to encounter the traitor who should so soon betray him.” (<a id="a74_332"></a>[UB 182:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_10))

The way the light plays on the surface of the water, especially at sunrise and late in the day, is indeed remarkable. The accompanying photo may help to provide a feeling for the soothing memories that Jesus held in his mind on that terribly sad occasion. Diane had arranged for us to go out on the water by boat. It was late afternoon and the reflection of the clouds in the water was absolutely stunning!

It is true, there is reason to call this small part of the world “Holy Land,” and it is because this place is anointed and full of His Presence. It is one of the places on this planet where we retain greater knowledge of our furthest past.

There, our Master was born, lived, taught, and was killed. Everything He did transformed into something new, something superior, something “Holy.” Nothing less than a Creator Son, the regent of a Local Universe, stepping on our land, eating with us, walking with us, working with us, suffering with us. Yes, for the simple and grandiose fact of having been with us, this land is called, rightly so; “Holy Land.”

There are sites that remain full of His Presence. It shows He was there. It is not easy to explain, but it doesn't take much effort to understand it, to feel it once you are there.

From the steps made of stones, leading from the house of the parents of the young John Mark, passing by Herod's Palace, and going to the outskirts of the “Puerta de los Leones”, in front of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, to the mythical Mount Hermon. From the “Via Dolorosa”, to the Golan Heights. All these places, like Bethlehem, Nazareth, Capernaum and Magdala they are all full of His Presence.

The stones, each one of them, continues to sing His name, shout His name, and in His language, in the language of the stones, which is the language of time that has stopped. They tell us to hear them, so that we may understand His Words saying “He who has ears to hear, let him hear” that it was for them a real honor to be stepped on by the sandals of the Master, by Our Father, by our Friend, by the One whom we love the most and Who loves us the most.

Each and every one of these stones continue singing (if you pay attention, you will hear it); “Hallelujah,” “Blessed is He who came in the Name of the Lord.” The Son of Man is still there, there is a continuous praise of the stones who were witnesses of His Bestowal. An eternal and wonderful song that floods your soul until you know that everything you have seen, and read, and imagined about Jesus and His Teachings, are true. He was there. With us. Then, and forever. It was, it sure is, and will be. It will be Forever.
