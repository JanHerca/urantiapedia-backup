I was fixing our morning coffee. There was a tiny gravel in my house shoe that irritated me. I removed it, and then said, “That reminds me of the fairy tale about the Princess and the Pea. She could feel the pea through 20 mattresses. That's how they could tell her from a commoner.”

After thinking a minute, I said, “That's why it's so important to be educated. If you're not, you have no store of information for things to remind you of. You have. nothing to think about.”

“When I was teaching, I added children's classics and the Bible to my curriculum. I told my students that I wasn't teaching the Bible to make them believe in any certain religion (although, I did), but just so they would know what people were talking about.”

“Yes”. Jon Lewis answered, “I hear people referring to Svengali, and I don't know what they mean. Who was he?”

“I don't know,” I replied, “but we'll find out”.

We looked in two dictionaries and two encyclopedias and didn't find it. Then Jon decided it must be a fictional character. So we looked in the right place and found it.

We read on page 1969 about when Jesus was alone in Gethsemane. His heart was indescribably heavy. He soothed himself by remembering good things from his earlier years. Then on <a id="a48_176"></a>[UB 160:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_12) Rodan tells us : “... build up for yourself and in yourself reserve galleries of beauty, goodness and artistic grandeur.”

Why all the preamble before I get into my subject. You'll see,

On <a id="a52_3"></a>[UB 48:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_26) we read: “If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well.”

And on <a id="a54_7"></a>[UB 102:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p4_1) we read: “The technique whereby you can accept another's idea as yours is the same whereby you may ‘let the mind which is in Christ be also in you’.”

Then they proceed to give us 700 pages of the attitudes of Jesus toward nearly every conceivable situation. Also, the first parts of the book were authored by God's Sons or Paradise Sons, and so they also express his attitudes and ideas.

So what do we need to do? Study _The URANTIA Book_. Study and Study and Study. Over and over again. It contains such an incredible amount of “meat” that we'll never remember it all. But the more we remember, the more we can apply the ideas of Jesus to the solutions of our problems.

We can swap our material mind for the mind of Jesus.
