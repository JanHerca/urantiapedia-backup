Such is the embracing generosity of the Father, he extends his welcome to each of us to accept the gift of eternal life and the ever increasing capacity for experiencing the joy of existence…true adventure!

Many readers have savoured the words “whosoever will,” for which a search results in seven quotes as follows.

**whosoever will**
<br style="clear:both;"/>

1\. The love of God is secondary to no other attribute of the Divine nature. It is wrong to think of God as being coaxed into loving his children.

> _It is wrong to think of God as being coaxed into loving his children because of the sacrifices of his Sons or the intercession of his subordinate creatures_**_,_** **_for the Father himself loves you.” It is in response to this paternal affection that God sends the marvelous Adjusters to indwell the minds of men. God’s love is universal; “_**_whosoever will_ **_may come.” He would “have all men be saved by coming into the knowledge of the truth.” He is “not willing that any should perish.”_** <a id="a46_501"></a>[[UB 2:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_2)] emphasis added

2\. The course ahead is announced, the way is open. The race for perfection is on! “Whosoever will” may enter.

> **_The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on!_** _whosoever will_ **_may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of the indwelling Adjuster and on the guidance of that good spirit of the Universe Son, which so_** _freely has been poured out upon all flesh_**_._** <a id="a50_459"></a>[[UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8)] emphasis added

3\. Jesus’ open-minded welcome is extended to all. With sympathetic heart he embraces every individual soul within the whole universe.

> **_Jesus was very broad in his outlook. He exhorted his followers to preach the gospel to all peoples. He was free from all narrow-mindedness._** _His sympathetic heart embraced all mankind, even a universe_**_. Always his invitation was, “_**_Whosoever will_**_, let him come.”_** <a id="a54_284"></a>[[UB 100:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_6)] emphasis added

4\. Jesus understood human frailty, yet in full knowledge of such weakness, placed no restrictions or qualifications save the faith of the one who comes.

> _To Jesus, Judas was a faith adventure_**_. From the beginning the Master fully understood the weakness of this apostle and well knew the dangers of admitting him to fellowship. But it is the nature of the Sons of God to give every created being a full and equal chance for salvation and survival. Jesus wanted not only the mortals of this world but the onlookers of innumerable other worlds to know that, when doubts exist as to the sincerity and wholeheartedness of a creature’s devotion to the kingdom, it is the invariable practice of the Judges of men fully to receive the doubtful candidate._** _The door of eternal life is wide open to all_**_; “_**_whosoever will_ **_may come”; there are_** _no restrictions or qualifications save the faith of the one who comes_**_._**  <a id="a58_782"></a>[[UB 139:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_7)] emphasis added

5\. Childlike trust is at the core of peacemaking. Being born anew is the destiny of “whosoever will” lose his life.

> **_Children can easily be taught to function as peacemakers. They enjoy team activities; they like to play together. Said the Master at another time: “_****_Whosoever will_** **_save his life shall lose it, but_** _whosoever will_ **_lose his life shall find it.”_** <a id="a62_269"></a>[[UB 140:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_19)] emphasis added

6\. Jesus asks the direct question. How long will it take us to persuade you to enter joyfully into your spiritual inheritance?

> **_“How long will you tarry in the valley of decision? Why do you halt between two opinions? Why should Jew or gentile hesitate to accept the good news that he is a son of the eternal God?_** _How long will it take us to persuade you to enter joyfully into your spiritual inheritance?_ **_I came into this world to reveal the Father to you and to lead you to the Father. The first I have done, but the last I may not do without your consent; the Father never compels any man to enter the kingdom. The invitation ever has been and always will be:_** _Whosoever will_**_, let him come and freely partake of the water of life.”_**  <a id="a66_631"></a>[[UB 165:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p3_8)] emphasis added

7\. To follow Jesus is to believe not merely in him but in the father who sent him. The person who sees Jesus sees the Father.

> **_“_**_He who believes this gospel, believes not merely in me but in Him who sent me_**_. When you look upon me, you see not only the Son of Man but also Him who sent me._** _I am the light of the world_**_, and_** _whosoever will_ **_believe my teaching_** _shall no longer abide in darkness_**_. If you gentiles will hear me, you shall receive the words of life and shall enter forthwith into the joyous liberty of the truth of sonship with God. If my fellow countrymen, the Jews, choose to reject me and to refuse my teachings, I will not sit in judgment on them, for_** _I came not to judge the world but to offer it salvation_**_. Nevertheless, they who reject me and refuse to receive my teaching shall be brought to judgment in due season by my Father and those whom he has appointed to sit in judgment on such as reject the gift of mercy and the truths of salvation. Remember, all of you, that I speak not of myself, but that I have faithfully declared to you that which the Father commanded I should reveal to the children of men. And these words which the Father directed me to speak to the world are words of divine truth, everlasting mercy, and eternal life.”_**  <a id="a70_1179"></a>[[UB 174:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p5_7)] emphasis added

A promise of life in abundance for “whosoever will.”
