_Editor's Note: Two longtime readers whose lives were dedicated to spreading _The Urantia Book_ and its teaching internationally, and whose paths crossed notably, have recently graduated to the mansion worlds._

Moussa N'Diaye, of Senegal, passed away on March 29. A former professor of Social Psychology at Dakar University, Moussa found the first French translation, Le Livre d'Urantia, in 1973. Having grown up Muslim and living in a Muslim country, he determined to introduce the teachings by a careful and patient approach. He first gathered a group of students to study new truths and concepts he found in the book, eventually introducing some of them to the book itself when he felt they were ready. When Norman Ingram visited Senegal in 1998, he was amazed to find a study group of 100 using just one book. Moussa traveled to Europe, Canada, and the United States, was a Representative of Urantia Foundation, and was the first president of the national Urantia Association of Senegal. Commented Guy Perron, “Moussa was a true spiritual instructor, teacher, mentor, and so much more.” Line St-Pierre observed, “He was such a humble and kind soul, interested in everyone, helping everyone.”

Norman Ingram passed away on May 29. He discovered _The Urantia Book_ in 1971 while living and working in Hawaii, and later lived in Colorado and California. Eventually he formed plans to take _The Urantia Book_ around the world. His travels began in Latin America and later took him to Africa, where he visited nearly every country, placing Urantia Books everywhere he went—not just in educational institutions, libraries, and prisons, but with seekers of truth he chanced to meet along the way. It was during these travels that he met Moussa N'Diaye and his large group of students, and brought them books of their own. He later visited China and, between missionary travels, operated a Urantia Book booth on the boardwalk at Venice Beach, California. Commented Kwadjo SPiRi after Norman's talk at the 2017 conference in Ghana, “The extensive nature of his travels around the world to do outreach and propagate _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings really impressed everyone.” Wrote Saskia Raevouri, “Norman was truly one of the greatest promoters of the revelation!”
