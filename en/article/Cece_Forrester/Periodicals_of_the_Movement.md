## Closeup

Begun in January, 1989, this monthly journal has a specific focus: “For Catholic readers of the Urantia Book and Other interested parties.” It publishes reflections on the gospels week by week according to the liturgical calendar, including teachings likely to be brought up, and how the Urantia revelation approaches these topics. 

Says editor Mary Daly of Garretson, South Dakota, “Our specific purpose is to offer support to Catholics who would like to stay in the Church but feel swamped by theological issues, and who may face both overt criticism and various subtle forms of isolation. It may also be helpful to ex-Catholics who have some forgiving to do, and to Other Christians who'd like scriptural reflections.” Adds Mary, “There are more Catholic _Urantia Book_ readers than you might think — and many who used to be.” 

The name is taken from a book on woodworking by Eric Sloane, who explains that while a nail might rust and a round peg may shrink and fall out, a square peg of green wood in a round hole of seasoned wood will _never_ fall out. Says Mary, “I use the name as a joking reference to my feeling that I may not be comfortable in the church all the time, but I know that's where I belong.” 

Mary is originally from Maryland, near Washington, D.C. She was raised in the Catholic Church and attended parochial schools. There were eight brothers and sisters in her family and Mary's parents were “not average but special”: her father, a scientist in the fields of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, discovered that the earth is pear-shaped. Her mother, a daughtcr of immigrants, writes books about Emily Dickenson. Mary majored in mathematics at College in Sarasota, Florida. She then entered a convent where she spent six years while studying philosophy and theology at Marygrove College. She also worked in a home for the aged and in pastoral care. During her time in the convent she was given _The Urantia Book_ by a friend. After leaving, she worked as a mathematician. In 1976 she married Michael Daly who works in management in the communications field. They moved to South Dakota in 1980. Their five children range in age from newborn daughter, Briege, to fourteen years. Says Mary, “My job now is mothering. And _The Urantia Book_ has taught me that it makes a difference who your parents are.”

The inception of the SQUARE PEG JOURNAL was “in part the fruit of a few years of startling spiritual renewal as we returned to active Church member- ship.” Up until the Urantia revelation, Mary believes, “The Catholic Church represents the most comprehensive body of thinking about Jesus, and therefore is the best jumping-off place for knowing _The Urantia Book_.”

In its first two years, the SQUARE PEG JOURNAL consisted mostly of listings of scriptures and corresponding readings from _The Urantia Book_. Scripture listings continue, but issues are now devoted to topics for several months at a time. This year, four issues focused on the Passion and the following four are about the Blessed Mother and the Divine Minister and how the two are related. A new topic, probably the Sacraments, will be covered next year. Usually published monthly, the SQUARE PEG JOURNAL will be bimonthly for the remainder of this year at least, but all subscribers will receive twelve issues for $ 12.00, U.S., $ 15.00 Canadian, and $ 20.00, overseas. “A discount is available as needed for a cheerful expression of interest”, notes the subscription policy, and a sample copy is available free on request.

The SQUARE PEG JOURNAL states that it is not intended to prosyletize either non-readers or non-Catholics. However, says Mary, “There is so much in _The Urantia Book_ that people don't see if they don't know any theology. There's a statement in _The Urantia Book_ about ”high gear spiritual performances“ awaiting a new revelation. I think of the book as fifth gear. You certainly can't start a car in fifth, and you can only shift to fifth from fourth or third gear. Many people have no idea what kinds of questions get raised 'in fourth gear'! If you go at _The Urantia Book_ without an appreciation for Christianity, your understanding will be much less than it could be.”
