_Clermont Beaudry_
Three Rivers

I subscribed last February to the monthly journal Réflectivité, which I now receive on my tablet and which I read attentively while savoring the exceptional quality and wealth of knowledge and experiences on several subjects, which are shared with us so generously by the participating members.

I showed up timidly on Sunday, May 5 in Drummondville to attend in person the conference on spiritual unity given by Gaétan Charland, whom I knew from the articles I had been reading for 2 months now.

Curious to see in person who these people were who published such wonderful articles, each one more brilliant than the last, in order to try to know them better, these completely unique people.

I really wasn't disappointed. When I introduced myself to Claude Flibotte, I was surprised that he told me that he had already heard my first name mentioned. Having an unusual first name, I told myself that there might have been a mistake about the person.

Gaétan began the conference on spiritual unity. I savored every word, every sentence, every experience, each of his trips around the world, meeting a multitude of truth seekers, going as far as popular China to carry the light of a great message of hope and living truth that each of the nations of the world in which we live must all know one day.

And what was even more astonishing in the story of this magnificent trip to China was that the majority of people who were present at his conference on spiritual unity were mostly women. Having been raised, surrounded by 7 women at home, my heart :heart: rejoiced even more. Continuing his speech on spiritual unity, he led us to also reflect on the importance of what we individually represent as seekers of truth, while reminding us that we are pioneers and ambassadors of this revelation and that the experience of each and every one was of great importance and that it was preferable not to be solitary and isolated readers, but without imposing anything on anyone either, since there were also a multitude of ways to serve God and that it was up to each of us to find the best way to serve during our life on this particular planet.

And at the same time, he invited us to reflect on the legacy we wanted to leave during our service here and now. It made me, the long-time reader, think, who had not opened _The Urantia Book_ for 23 years, and yet, everything good in my being, in my soul and in my thoughts comes in large part from this revelation as it was taught and revealed to me. This light is still very much alive and well fixed in my heart :heart: and my mind.

I believe I have never stopped serving my neighbor, but in a more limited way. We never know the positive influence we exert on those around us through our good humor, our way of living and thinking. I may be harsh on myself, but I find it unfortunate and painful at the same time not to have known you during all these years that have passed. But at the same time, the Father who lives in me knows better than anyone the path that was best to follow, in his plan and his design for my own progression, and on that, I cannot do otherwise than trust him perfectly. The revelation is found in ***The Urantia Book*** :closed_book:, but the way to live it to the best of our knowledge, it is lived in daily life in relation to humans.

Having scribbled notes from the conference on my little piece of paper, at the end of Gaétan's speech, I listened attentively to the comments of the people who were invited to do so voluntarily, and I understood that I was probably the only one who had not heard this conference on spiritual unity. Obviously, Line, who had seen that I was new to the usual landscape, asked me if I wanted to give my impressions on the subject that I had just heard. I humbly admit that I was not very comfortable and prepared to speak and; my words jostled nervously as I left. But all in all, her request was very generous, and I greatly appreciated it.

At the very end, before leaving the conference room, I greeted most of the people who were there and I felt a warm welcome and a beautiful fraternity from everyone. I also went to shake hands and thank Gaétan for the magnificent conference that I had just heard and to my great surprise he gave me a fraternal hug which greatly moved me.

I left this conference with my heart full of enthusiasm, and at the same time very upset and troubled not to have known you during these last 23 years. Since May 5, I have watched a large number of videoconferences that have been set up on the Urantia Foundation website, and I am supremely amazed by the quality and the exceptional knowledge, of the people who share their thoughts and their personal experiences on different subjects, in a very organized thought and in a perfectly understandable human language, as if I were listening to a spiritual symphony that is listened to and heard by the ear of the spirit. Even the voice, even the tone of the participants resonates like musical harmonies, and radiates a heavenly luminosity to my eyes.

All this light was revealed to me, because I have been a new reader of the journal Réflectivité for 3 months now. In less than 3 weeks, since the conference on May 5, I feel like I have progressed 23 years in one go!

To Gaétan's question, what legacy will we leave behind during our time on earth :earth_asia: ? Your legacy is already infinitely rich, and directly linked to the theme of spiritual unity that was at the heart of today's conference. In just 3 weeks, 23 years of living truths have passed through my mind in a space-time shortcut, as if the Father wanted me not to be a sad son of God, whatever the reasons that afflict me. I am perfectly aware that my talents are modest. I will continue to walk on the path of light. I believe I have walked around the earth ten times in the last year, reflecting on life, reflecting on heaven and earth. In my walk, I finally ended up meeting you on May 5th. It can't be a coincidence. Thank you for showing me a direction.

To the question, what will I leave as a legacy? I will go for a walk to see what I will see.
