Many of us are reaching a point in our life where we realize that we may not have many years left on this world, lovingly known to us as Urantia. Depending on how we look at this, it can be both good news and bad news, at the same time.

It is good news because we are so blessed that the revelation has helped us to look forward to eternal life in our Father's friendly and well-ordered cosmos. We have faith that the most amazing journeys and adventures lie before us. We delight in the revelation's glorious detail and sincere promise of enthralling future discoveries. Even so, the book tells us this, "Very important is the work of preparation for the next higher sphere, but nothing equals the importance of the work of the world in which you are actually living.” We sure do not want to leave this world behind, without first having bestowed all that we can to benefit those adventurous and promising souls who are coming along behind us.

Imagine for a moment what _The Urantia Book_ has meant to you. What it has done to enhance your family life, your work life, your friendships, your perceptions of meaning and value, your personal strength, your courage to carry on, and your will to persevere. In one way or another, it has made us all better people.

The work of this revelation is much more than any one person can do. The work is more than any single lifetime can accomplish. It is for this reason that we must band together across generations to do this work, to make certain that this liberating gift of truth is liberally available to all who seek it, not only right now, but also into the distant future. Organizations like _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship are uniquely positioned to accomplish the work of sharing the revelation, nurturing those who love it and helping them to study and share it. Quite simply, we are the origin, history, and destiny of this revelation.

When you leave the Fellowship a legacy gift, you are ensuring that the work we do will not only continue but will progressively get better, more efficient, and more effective. In leaving a legacy gift, you are helping to ensure that future students, even those yet unborn, will not only have access to the original revelation, but also to the support, fellowship, and friendship of fellow readers. With many projects and so much work we want and need to do, we must keep forging ahead, and we are counting on you to help us leave this spiritual legacy to our children and grandchildren, even to all of God's children on Urantia.
