_Ability to comprehend is the mortal passport to Paradise. Willingness to believe is the key to Havona. The acceptance of sonship, co-operation with the indwelling Adjuster, is the price of evolutionary survival_ <a id="a40_213"></a>[[UB 26:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p4_15)]. 

Comprehending God to enter Paradise? We have little idea what Paradise is and what to expect and now we are informed we must comprehend to enter! Urantia Book authors are giving us advance notice there is work to do. Paradise is not automatic; we must grow into qualifying for Paradise. Comprehension advances brilliance and we may assume it also energizes curiosity and desire to know the Father. Gaining brilliance is a growth process over an “eternity of time!” We start simply on our nativity sphere. 

Very early we recognize but do not understand authority. As a child we did not comprehend our parents were our first exposure to authority and law, but later we likely comprehended why and how they applied their home law. Later, we begin questioning through an adjustment period leading to maybe greater understanding. We eventually comprehend someone special likes us and wants to spend time with us! Do you recall this neat moment?  It is really nice to become aware someone loves us. As we age we comprehend more of life and later we comprehend there is more to the planet. We begin to comprehend more even though we understand there is continuing mystery. Our progress varies according to many factors. The “golden years” could be the best planetary experiences if we worked on comprehending situations, life, purposes and the God of our imagination! Similarly and on a grand scale, we must comprehend more as we progress toward Paradise. 

The purpose of this essay is to call attention to the vital requirement for progressive advancement, at least a vital one for life stages beyond human. The authors use the words ‘comprehension’ and ‘comprehend’ many times in the book, which indicates there is very important news to share. We must advance our understanding and comprehension of life, the Father, Michael’s purposes, and a whole view of Creation. We would be wise to begin now as we are able to comprehend _The Urantia Book_ and to attempt deeper understanding of why this is a grand gift to humanity. 

We’d be wise to do our best to understand their hints and comments about future plans and intentions. What is the real meaning of “Settled in Light and Life?” We’d be wise to attempt a better understanding of divine methods and style for planning and achieving such a high planetary spiritual state. 

“Ah ha!” moments are wonderful sometimes. They are very satisfying when you’ve been working on something for a while and were approaching distaste and impatience. Those insight moments lead to understanding what to do next for a project or they may lead a person to see what was wrong or to understand someone’s bad behavior. 

We are told in the quote above we must have ability to comprehend before we arrive at Paradise. We must be a willing believer, and accepting sonship is vital for survival. We see that Jesus is helping us achieve greater understanding of the Father, although he was keenly aware of our planetary difficulties. Even as earthly mortals of animalistic origin, we are able to understand more through revelation. 

## Begin Now 

We could dismiss the big Urantia Book as too difficult to understand, at least some portions. Given the fact we are told progress is required for each mortal and that comprehension is required, we could assume it wise to begin serious attempts at comprehending the Cosmos and the Father’s purposes while we are yet Urantians and as new information is presented to this planet. The authors inform us we must comprehend what we are now doing and also where we are going. We may expect marvelous new insights and greater comprehension of the Father’s purposes and methods as we attempt to presently move inward to the center of all life! We are told to be willing to make an effort and also informed we have work to perform. The authors laid out a vision of divine expectations for ascenders. Comprehension is sufficiently vital for the book’s authors mention it in the opening lines: _In the hope of facilitating comprehension…_ <a id="a56_927"></a>[[UB 0:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_3)] and Jesus’ parables are designed to help us see the Father in Spirit and to comprehend his nature. 

> _We teach you how best to execute the things we command you to do_. <a id="a58_70"></a>[[UB 37:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_4)]   

We gain brilliance with help from brilliant teachers! 

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Journal/OUR-DIVINE-FAMILY-by-Kim-S.-MacKenzie.jpg">
</figure>

Our realization of available, loving help ought to remove much of the fear we may experience while anticipating the “other side” and of what is expected. We are told the Father’s Universe and purposes are friendly and his Sons will befriend us throughout our Paradise ascent. Our Master Son in Jesus told people “Fear not”; he knew of the Father’s friendship and plans.  
<br style="clear:both;"/>

The reasons for comprehending the Urantia revelation teachings are important. Let me highlight a few: 

- _…expand cosmic consciousness…_ [0.2, 1.2]
- _…revelation of God to man… which may possibly contribute to a further illumination and unification of the human concept of the nature and the character of the personality of the Universal Father_ <a id="a72_199"></a>[[UB 2:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p0_2)].
- _…comprehension of the personality of the Eternal Son…_ <a id="a73_58"></a>[[UB 6:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p8_6)]
- _… spiritual comprehension of the Father-Son partnership…_  <a id="a74_62"></a>[[UB 26:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_2)]
- _…comprehension of the Supreme Being…_  <a id="a75_42"></a>[[UB 26:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p6_4)] 

This is hard work for all of us. Taken in tiny steps, this long journey is surmountable with kind and loving teachers and companion guides. 

There are easier concepts during our mortal life state; we know of heaven, angels, Jesus the Christ, and by faith we know of God. We simplify and hold these dear. The simpler details of many religions are known and we have immortalized them well, considering planetary setbacks. The angels and many other teachers will not leave us unattended or unguided. We might be tempted to say to ourselves, “This is too much” when considering the enormous amount of information given us in _The Urantia Book_. We are not alone. Consider the many honest admissions of several of the book’s authors who tell us they don’t understand everything. We are to be faithful in our works and trust the Father for everything just as they do. This article is intended as a cheering piece to urge readers to try sincere efforts to comprehend the deep _importance of understanding_ who we are and what our Divine friends expect of us now and for next life stages. Surely they would also expect us to understand why the revelation was offered. 

## What Slowly Increasing Comprehension Has Done for Me 

I have increasingly felt greater conviction and confidence in _The Urantia Book_ teachings and relating to Jesus and our Paradise Father as a result of new understandings. This new and still increasing comprehension has given me greater power and determination to work for God and to team with Michael. This humble feeling and confidence is not unique, for Michael desires all his creatures to know the Father. We will experience increasing joyful confidence at each heavenly advancement stage. Learning the universe of universes is friendly has removed fear and anxiety; there is no grudging feeling of obligation. Learning a little more about the friendship of God is warming and attractive in my soul. And now, after reading almost continuously since 1968, the gifts of increasing comprehension are very much appreciated. 

There are too many quotes that could be listed here for examples of new confidence from clarity of purposes and methods. This one “hit me between the eyes” in a sudden insight moment one day:  

> _The true perspective of any reality problem—human or divine, terrestrial or cosmic—can be had only by the full and unprejudiced study and correlation of three phases of universe reality: origin, history, and destiny. The proper understanding of these three experiential realities affords the basis for a wise estimate of the current status._ <a id="a87_345"></a>[[UB 19:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_6)]  

Now we see we cannot gain a true perspective of life, the cosmos or any other problem without understanding more of destiny! Mercy me—I never thought of that before! This insight removes a lot of guessing and is a “compass correction” for life. 

Much greater new comprehension of Jesus is gained by reading about him in Part IV. Not only have many Christians been correct about accepting him, but now we are told more of what he actually said and how he lived his marvelous life example. We have much more information than what is found in the _New Testament_. He really was a nice guy! He really was a brave and courageous servant who really was loyal to the Paradise Father’s purposes! Great new affirmation from this revelation has confirmed new reasons for relating to him! It has created a strong desire to be on his team. 

Comprehending God’s wonderful provisions continues to be a joy when I realize each of us is highly valued on high. This continues to be a major power energizer for any mission work I want to do henceforth. I sign many letters and emails with IAITUBMUMLUB, an acronym which stands for: I Am In This Urantia Book Movement Until My Last Urantian Breath.  

Comprehending more of the Father’s purposes and our Master Son Michael’s life modeling has been and continues to be an energizing force within. _This is available to anyone!_ Your experiences are vital for you and you are divinely loved on high. Even angels watch us and love to lead us for they comprehend the Father’s many purposes, at least partially and certainly to greater levels than mortals.

</figure>

Comprehension increases as we participate with others in study and this is one important reason for study groups. Thought Adjusters apparently know how to help one another as they serve in the deep mind. Therefore, as Adjusters are gathered with you in study group teaming together there is profound benefit to everyone in the group! Many times I was humbled on hearing another person’s interpretation, realizing I was too confident in an earlier understanding. I understood how important it is to listen. 
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Not Interested?  Please Reconsider 

At this point we could consider what are the limitations or restraints for persons who have no interest in greater learning or of progressive comprehension. We are told the advancements we receive beyond this native sphere are based on _testing_. Perhaps a crude analogy (as compared to the universe) would be school grade levels. What wise teacher would pass a failing student to the next grade knowing such an action could be harmful to a student? Lovingly, a good teacher would augment efforts to inspire and teach a student for reaching higher and achieving a better education. We may extrapolate this familiar provision to loving Divine Parents who want each person to advance, although they understand rate of movement varies widely. We are told something of vast provisions of the mortal ascension plan! We accept sonship and then get to work at progressing spiritually inward. We do not advance unless we comprehend each level and we must sincerely desire progress. Advancement means breaking down all the undesirables of human nature including prejudice, hate, anger, jealousy, laziness, and pride. The Creators require us to understand with increasing new insight we must decrease in human nature and take on divine nature like God! 

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Journal/Teacher-and-Students-300x200.jpg">
</figure>

Like Urantian first graders withheld, we likely will be held back until we reach comprehension levels sufficient to understand reasons and life at each new level. Progress through the heavenly portals and spheres will not happen unless a soul desires and cooperates with God. If this is lacking and if a soul moves too far by choices in the wrong direction, there is real danger of permanent isolation and soul death. Why take the risk of such a fate? Recall the authors record that present status is not as important as the direction in which we are moving. 

The message is clear: we will not be advanced without effort. Again, it seems wise while we are mortals to exert great effort to attain greater comprehension of the authors’ messages.  

Another reason I think comprehension is so vital is the fact the authors tell us of power mobilizations in the outer space levels beyond the grand universe and they hint we might have service opportunities in the far distant future on these space levels! Imagine how important becomes our present beginnings of comprehension efforts. We could get a head start! Why would anyone turn down these potential opportunities? 
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Accepting Corrections 

We have been wrong on some details in many of world religions. Let’s take a look at the aforementioned quote from Paper 19, Section 1 wherein a Divine Counselor kindly calls attention to errors of a strictly mortal viewpoint: “The human mind would ordinarily crave to approach the cosmic philosophy portrayed in these revelations by proceeding from the simple and the finite to the complex and the infinite, from human origins to divine destinies. But that path does not lead to spiritual wisdom. Such a procedure is the easiest path to a certain form of genetic knowledge, but at best it can only reveal man’s origin; it reveals little or nothing about his divine destiny.” 

> _Even in the study of man’s biologic evolution on Urantia, there are grave objections to the exclusive historic approach to his present-day status and his current problems._ **_The true perspective of any reality problem—human or divine, terrestrial or cosmic—can be had only by the full and unprejudiced study and correlation of three phases of universe reality: origin, history, and destiny._** _The proper understanding of these three experiential realities affords the basis for a wise estimate of the current status._ <a id="a123_525"></a>[[UB 19:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_6), emphasis added]  

We may understand from this counsel that we cannot correctly comprehend what we do not properly observe. In the new revelation we are invited to new insights of reality and therefore the authors are participating with Michael and the Paradise Father for upgrading our comprehension potential. Do we not comprehend these divine actions as great gifts of love? Does it not feel really good to be valued on high? Do we comprehend correction is vital for advancing our understandings? 

New comprehension is a gift on receiving clarifying new information! What are your feelings on suddenly realizing a new concept of heaven? Did you and do you feel good inside? The benefits of new insight may accumulate throughout our Paradise journey. We are told there are even greater insights and delights in helping our fellows advance their comprehension and enlightenment. We will be amazed and awed to profound levels from new learning and dazzling insight for soul invigorating inspiration for wanting more of the Father! Greater comprehension and living understanding are by-products of service and sharing. 

It is reasonable to assume Michael came to Urantia to give to Urantians and his entire universe a _new level_ of understanding of mortal spiritual possibilities. He has helped untold numbers of personalities at their life station. He also gave us a new philosophical frame of thinking for relating to God and other of his Sons including angels as new possibilities for spirit insight are now presented for all his planets. Even though angels are not normally visible, he assured us they are real, and in the fifth epochal revelation we are presented with marvelous new detail lending credibility to his teachings. Comprehension is what he had in mind for all of his universe sons! Comprehend… he is asking us to replace old, untrue concepts for the new and better way. 

We could select most any of the major topics from the book and of Jesus’ ministry for emphasizing reasons for comprehending relating to God and his many diverse Sons. Let us look at just one here. From the morontia Jesus:   

> _And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they soon will be taken away._ <a id="a133_534"></a>[[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2)] 

In essence, he said we must advance, increase desire and comprehend the Father’s way. He is clear about what the Father will do if we do not advance: we shall be “trimmed” and ministered to by the Father until we do. If we choose not, then we are dead. 

## Arming in Spirit for a Possibly Difficult Ascension Career 

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Journal/Unwasted-Talents-300x225.jpg">
</figure>

What shall we comprehend as vitally important from Jesus as he verified and confirmed for spirit advancement? One of the great reasons for becoming divine-like is to better handle _disappointment_. We are not guaranteed a disappointment-free ascension career, but we may continue in strong faith. As we become more of divine nature, we assume these high ideals of personhood. Comprehend there are high divine ideals for relating to many different beings and we must be progressive to advance. Brilliance in relating is a desirable achievement throughout the Father’s enterprises. A thorough review of Jesus’ life reveals ample evidence of this fact. Reading Part IV we know Jesus had a difficult life; despite his troubles he set a marvelous example of dedicated faith for all his creatures. 

We may understand Jesus wants us to do great things and set a path of cooperation to accomplish new levels of growth and understanding. In other words, _this is an action universe_; we are not to be static or stagnant. Recall Jesus’ parable of the talents! Comprehend our personal decisions _and actions_ are vital for relating to divinity. 
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## No Excuses 

We’ve been victimized! Caligastia and Daligastia with Lucifer and others went into insurrection and plummeted Urantia into darkness. We were further deprived of Adam and Eve’s full biologic contribution, which also would have contributed more to spiritual capacity. This failure eventually caused a Melchizedek Son to incarnate with us to teach, to fan a faint flickering remaining light. Jesus didn’t allow his believers to whine and complain because of the past; neither do the authors allow for us to make excuses. Now it’s time to “buck up,” to face reality and learn for good measure we _are not less valued_ because the errors of others, but rather highly valued just as all mortals throughout Nebadon. We are not to whimper and whine of our difficulties, but instead to pick up our load and help one another to comprehend better ways! The fifth epochal revelation is here to help us with new insights of bravery and courage. Yes, comprehend we are working in disadvantage, but reward for faith and loyalty will be profound for honest, loving Urantians on reaching the next light levels. Comprehend that Jesus saw sincerity in people and welcomed them in his fold. Comprehend his teachings are synergistic in that all of his teachings affirm all his other teachings. Comprehend there is a brilliant spiritual career waiting for all believers. 

Mortal comprehension is limited, yes, but effort replaces laziness and effort is noted on high for anyone who truly desires the Father. We could simplify and say, “He who works not, eats not.” Comprehend that no effort means no or little understanding of cosmic reality. We may try to be as perfect as is possible while still human mortals even though we cannot absolutely see all perfection. We will understand more as we are in motion toward Paradise. Pick your favorite topics and compare your present understanding of life compared to when you were younger. Are you now able to better comprehend life? Or will we accept a blinded view of complaining and grumbling? 

## The Original Personality 

We can now address personality comprehension; the serious but joyful attempts at comprehending the Father’s marvelous personality! This is a highly important reason we have been gifted with the teachings. There is so much to this topic, but it is educational for us to think of a real Person who truly loves each son. With attention to this truth we can realize that we are valued beyond what we presently comprehend! We are told Jesus could love mortals so much because he values us so much! This is revealed to us in Part IV via midwayer commentary. 

**We belong in study groups to** **_edify and encourage_** **one another to attempt a greater understanding of the teachings.** These groups are for edifying one another as kindly as we are able. Each person who comprehends something we don’t understand is ministered to by a Thought Adjuster and Michael’s Spirit of Truth, which by the way, is actually a ministry of the Father and the Creator Son. Why turn down opportunities to gain greater understanding when so great of ministry and love is available? Recall the authors tell us they regard the love from Thought Adjusters is the greatest. Find your own words to express your understanding of this Father feature! 

We end with the four Cs: Communication, Conviction, Cooperation, and Comprehension. These are intended to mean _commune_ with God through prayer—devoted and worshipful meditation. It means strengthening _conviction_ of truth by relating to Michael and his Spirit within, and _cooperation_ means being obedient and willing to transform into a new being, unique in all Creation. It means new delights of understanding _comprehension_ of present knowledge and a willingness to faithfully seek more. 

A new purpose may emerge: _W__e are to help each other make it to Parad_ise! Sing your praises!
