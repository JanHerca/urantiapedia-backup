January 24, 1960

The question has arisen, and rightly so, regarding the immediate goals and the purpose of the Urantia Brotherhood organization. It seems fitting and proper that for my annual report I take up this question and explain what we are trying to do. Therefore I submit the following statements as viewed from January of 1960. In presenting this document I shall rely upon the following sources to substantiate my report: _The Urantia Book_, the Constitution of Urantia Brotherhood, and the acts and deliberations of the Executive Committee and Departmental Committees.

The subject to be considered may be divided into three distinct areas:

1. The long range purpose of Urantia Brotherhood.
2. The immediate goals.
3. The value and significance of the Brotherhood organization.

1\. The purpose of the Brotherhood is aptly expressed in Article II of the Constitution where we read:

“The purpose of Urantia Brotherhood are the study and dissemination of the teachings of the _The Urantia Book_; the promotion, improvement and expansion among the peoples of the world of the comprehension and understanding of Cosmology and the relation of the planet on which we live to the universe, of the the genesis and destiny of Man and his relation to God, and of the teachings of Jesus Christ; and the inculcation and encouragement of the realization and appreciation of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man – in order to increase and enhance the comfort, happiness, and well-being of Man, as an individual and as a member of society, by fostering a religion, a philosophy, and a cosmology which are commensurate with Man's intellectual and cultural development, through the medium of fraternal association, ever obedient and subservient to the laws of this country and of all countries wherein Urantia Brotherhood may extent.”

Nothing need be added to the above statement of purposes. These will be our aims as long as the Brotherhood exists, and the chartering of each society witnesses, in part, the fulfillment of this purpose.

2\. The immediate goals, in our judgment, constitutes the best way to proceed in the present to effect the purpose of the Brotherhood as it unfolds day by day, year by year. Our planning consists of several specific goals.

First, we are trying in a quiet, unspectacular, but personal manner to put the book in the hands of as many people as possible – particularly those where it will find grateful reception. It has been sent as a gift to many influential people. It has been placed on the shelves of hundreds of libraries and bookstores throughout the world. In this way we are confident that those who seek the truth shall one day find the fulfillment of their quest in _The Urantia Book_.

Another immediate goal is being realized through the work of the Urantia Brotherhood School which was established by the Committee on Education. This school is training teachers and leaders for that time when the movement gains wider acceptance in the world. We regret that for the present the school is limited to one geographical area. As the demand for an extension of the services of this school to other parts of the world increases, a more extensive program will be undertaken – in fact, is now being planned.

The Executive Committee also foresees that the book must be translated into other languages. Although publication has not been authorized as yet, a French translation is in process. Translations will require large sums of money. The Brotherhood will need financial aid, especially from those people of means who will supply the funds for translating the book into other languages. And it is my recommendation that we plan definitely toward that end as soon as possible.

The Executive Committee recognizes the need for a closer relationship between the individual societies and between the Executive Committee and these societies. Accordingly we plan to enlarge the Quarterly News Letter so that this channel of communication will open up a closer working relationship and understanding between all groups of the Brotherhood. This goal is also being realized through the work of our field representative, William Sadler, Jr., who is now functioning as a liaison between the Executive Committee and each society. During this beginning period when we are so anxious for things to move at a faster pace, great patience and understanding is required of all of us.

In all its functions the Executive Committee relies heavily upon each Departmental Committee functioning in its own domain to achieve the goals of the Brotherhood.

3\. The value and significance of the Brotherhood organization: The writers of the Constitution of Urnatia Brotherhood carefully and deliberately provided for an institution with a strong central over-control, while at the same time establishing the autonomy of the individual societies. In so doing they were consciously aware of the statement in _The Urantia Book_ which says: “While it is true that the institutionalization of religion has usually detracted from its spiritual quality, it is also a fact that no religion has thus far succeeded in surviving without the aid of institutional organization of some degree, greater or lesser.” (pg. 1083)

And may it be ever thus – that individual believers will band together to form Urantia societies, and these societies will group together to form the Urantia Brotherhood organization for the purpose of attaining the goals herein expressed.

But let us not overlook another important function of this organization, namely, the safeguarding of this revelation which has been entrusted to us. Religious fanatics and those with sinister intent as well as many well-meaning but misguided individuals will try to attach themselves to our cause or even try to take it over completely. Such have already arisen. Our constitution is designed to prevent such attempts. We are safeguarded by law. The Brotherhood reserves the right of revoking a charter when necessary or of expelling individuals it deems harmful. The Urantia Foundation retains control over the book itself. In supporting the organization we are insuring the future of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

We are not in a hurry. We will not be stampeded into unwise actions to promote our revelation. Those of us who have witnessed the formulation of the Urantia papers and the subsequent publication of _The Urantia Book_ will zealously guard and control the manner in which it will be presented to the world, letting the example of our unseen friends, who have waited hundreds of years to make this revelation, curb our own impatience and govern our enthusiasm.

Respectfully submitted,
