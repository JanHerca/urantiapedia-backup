Well, because if you are reading _The Urantia Book_ you know what it means to be spiritually hungry and you know firsthand what a difference the revelation makes when one’s soul is truly fed. 

Jesus described the pain of spiritual longing well when he poignantly said, “_The world is filled with hungry souls who famish in the very presence of the bread of life; men die searching for the very God who lives within them. Men seek for the treasures of the kingdom with yearning hearts and weary feet when they are all within the immediate grasp of living faith_.” [UB 159:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_8) 

Doubtless, you’ve experienced the ardent search for truth and meaning that he describes and know how good it feels to find spiritual teachings that actually make sense. Do you remember how it feels to wonder, “Is God really that way?” “Who am I and how do I fit in?” “What is the value and purpose of my life?” “Why does God let evil exist?” “Why does God let good people suffer?” Not to mention how confusing it can be when, in the process of sincerely questioning, one is confronted with the rigidity of dogmatic fundamentalism on one side and the baroness of faithless secular science on the other. 

Certainly, those of us who are blessed to have this amazing revelation in our lives do know how it feels to have satisfying and logical answers to life’s most perplexing questions. We who read _The Urantia Book_ don’t have to fear death, or see the world as a hopeless mess, or think of God as “_an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished..._” [UB 188:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_8) We have been given a precious gift by being fully liberated from these stultifying beliefs. 

Sadly, some people are so spiritually starved that they’ve lost their appetite for spiritual things, even for the truth. Nobody seems to be making much sense or speaking much truth anyway. And yet, the world needs liberating and life giving words of truth now more than ever before and we _Urantia Book_ readers have those words. 

We at _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship still burn to share this amazing gift with the world. We haven’t given up on it and we won’t. Sure the task is difficult and daunting, but someone has to do it. Someone has to share this sustenance with those who hunger and thirst for it. Indifference and apathy won’t feed starving souls any more than it will feed starving bodies. We’re committed to this project of making the book readily available to all who seek for truth and hunger for righteousness and we’ll keep exploring every opportunity available to us. We want to show the world how divinely relevant and sublimely real this book is and that it is in fact an epochal revelation from a friendly and well-ordered universe. We’ll get it into the hands of those who long for it but we won’t stop there. Once they have it, we’ll do all we can to bring them together for meaningful socialization around it. In other words, we’ll keep doing what we’ve done for the last 60 years. We can’t do it without YOU. We need your help. Are you with us? 

We are also committed to YOU, as a fellow student of these teachings and someone who is a member of our Brotherhood of Believers. The revelation tells us we have a sacred obligation to serve you. We take that very seriously, which is why we’ve thoughtfully created this great publication to highlight the scholarly and spiritual offerings of our precious and diverse Urantia brotherhood. 

Please join us in this great and ongoing project by giving what you can. Make a donation, and be at peace knowing that because you did some hungry soul will be fed and that they will find the God of their dreams and know that they are not a cosmic orphan but truly a child of the living GOD.
