“The kingdom of Heaven is neither a social nor economic order; it is an exclusively spiritual brotherhood of God-knowing individuals.”, (Urantia Book, <a id="a38_151"></a>[UB 99:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_2))

The first Parliament of World's Religions occurred in 1893 at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. The list of religions represented at that historic event reads like a Who's Who of 20th century religions.

As a matter of fact, the Baha'i faith made its debut at the 1893 Parliament. A century later the Parliament of World's Religions met again in the same city, at the same hotel, for the same purpose. But this time _The Urantia Book_ and its readers made their debut.

Speaking only in terms of outreach, it is literally true that nearly every major faith in the world has become aware of _The Urantia Book_ in some way as a result of this event. Many who came representing other faiths made it known to us that they also read and believe _The Urantia Book_.

The experience was nothingless than magical. By the second day I quit saying,“That's an interesting coincidence,” and just relished in the joy of being wholly led by the spirit and the angels. . imagined the angels rejoicing for this great blending of faiths. I felt their satisfaction for a job well done, and I beheld their work in a way that $I$ have never before witnessed.

Those of us who were there representing _The Urantia Book_ all shared a similar sense of heightened celestial guidance. We never had to worry about meeting each other for meals or plenary sessions. Our group would effortlessly end up sitting in the same row. At meals our group would share stories of our daily encounters, which even we found hard to believe at times.

We all felt divinely happy as we shared the good news of the Fifth Epochal Revelation with the world's religionists, who, for the most part, received it with an open heart.

The experience has changed me. I feel the peace and well being that comes with the wholehearted assurance that the Most Highs do “rule in the kingdoms of men.” I, for one, am deeply thankful to have had an opportunity to represent _The Urantia Book_ at the Parliament.

The opening session of The Parliament of World's Religions was like a pageant. Each religion made a sincere offering to God and those assembled with songs, chants, prayers and dances. Some praised the Father, some praised the Mother and others the Spirit. The sincerity of the moment touched my heart and I wrote this prayer.

## Parliamentary Prayer

Oh Father,
Hear our song.
We naise our voice to you,
Help us find the light.

Oh Mother,
See our dance.
We move ourselves in you,
Help us through this night.

Oh Spirit,
Touch our hearts.
We fill our souls with you,
Help us make things right.

From around this lonesome glabe we've come 
With hopeful heart and willing hand. 
We reach and touch the world with faith 
For peace and love we make a stand.

No mone to rage in vain disgrace
That “they can not be one with me!”
But ever let us keep apace
In joy of unity.

Oh Heavenly Hosts,
Embrace us now.
And lift the veil of dark despair,
Show us the wonder of your light
And the many sparkling colors there.
