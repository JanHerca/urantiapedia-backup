(Originally given by Paula Thompson. on Jesus Birthday August 21, 1994 in Shepherds Field, Bethlehem)


Beloved Universal Father, Michaelof Nebadon, Master Jesus: Hear our prayer.
We have gathered together on the threshold of a new millennium (as the world
reckons time) to offer you our sincere devotion and thanksgiving.
For having come forth from the center of creation with our Creative Mother
and in the name and glory of The Paradise Father of all, you created us.
_Thank you Master!_

Thank you for this vast experiential adventure we call life.
Thank you for the myriad opportunities to serve and learn and grow
as part of your loving universe family.
Moving ever upward and inward through your grace to the portals of Paradise.
Thank you for your faithful watch care and ministry.
Thank you for your liberating revelations of truth.
Thank you for your celestial children who lovingly lead us in the ways of
righteousness.
Thank you especially Master for the life you lived on Urantia, demonstrating
the way by which ordinary humans like us may live a Godlike life.

We welcome you Lord Michael, Sovereign of Nebadon, Jesus of Nazareth, we
gather in your name, come now and bless us with your radiant presence.

We welcome and acknowledge all who are gathered here on this occasion,
those seen and those unseen.
Welcome Angels, Midwayers, Student Visitors, Heavenly Hosts, Planetary
Supervisors, and Believers around the globe, come join us as we praise our
beloved Sovereign. Join us as we honor and adore him.

Master, press closely to us, hold us tightly in the embrace of your spirit.
Touch us with your truth and grace.
We are pilgrims of remembrance, recounting the life you lived as a man among us.
You took in the fullness of human life, the joy and sorrow, the tragedy 
and triumph, and you gave back the fullness of God, the peace which passes
understanding.
You showed us the way to human dignity and sublime self-respect.
We have truly come to know your humanity as well as your divinity.
You have refreshed our souls with your understanding sympathy, 
renewed our strength with your enduring hope, 
lessened our burdens with your forgiving tolerance, 
illuminated our path with your unfailing wisdom, 
and restored our faith with your sublime Fatherly affection and devotion.
You have allowed us to foretaste in time the Paradise Father's eternal love.
Truly Jesus, you have bound our broken hearts and set us free,
You are our Master, our Father, our Brother, and our friend.
You are our inspiration and our way home. Our hearts are bursting 
for love of you.

On this occasion we would give you a gift.
Our sincere commitments to be like you, true ambassadors of the
Heavenly Father.
Know Master, that we mark this day as a new beginning.
We consecrate our wills to the doing of the Father's Will.
With new resolve we go out into chis weary, way worn world,
to spread your light...your peace...your forgiveness...and your love.
We will that all men and women should come to know and love you as we do.
To the end that rhey may see you living again, in and through us,
and thereby help Urantia to reach its goal of Light and Life.

Help us Lord Michael, to usher in this new dispensation of peace and prosperity
for your children's sake. Show us the way to love as you love, trust as you trust,
give as you give, and be as you are.
For truly, “Old things are passing away; behold, all things are becoming new.”

Even so may it be, Amen.

> Glorious Father and Mother, in one parent combined,
> Loyal would we be to your divine nature.
> Your own self to live again in and through us
> By the gift and bestowal of your divine spirit,
> Thus reproducing you imperfectly in this sphere
> As you are perfectly and majestically shown on high.
> Give us day by day your sweet ministry of brotherhood
> And lead us moment by moment in the pathway of loving service.📃[22]
> Be you ever and unfailingly patient with us
> Even as we show forth your patience to our children.
> Give us the divine wisdom that does all things well
> And the infinite love that is gracious to every creature.
> Bestow upon us your patience and loving-kindness
> That our charity may enfold the weak of the realm.
> And when our career is finished, make it an honor to your name,
> A pleasure to your good spirit, and a satisfaction to our soul helpers.
> Not as we wish, our loving Father, but as you desire the eternal good of your mortal children,
> Even so may it be. (<a id="a119_22"></a>[UB 144:5.55-72](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_55))
