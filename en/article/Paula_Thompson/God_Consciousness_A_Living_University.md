_By Paula Thompson, Administrative Director, Urantia Fellowship, Arvada, USA_

Oh, My God Consciousness!

I hope you don't my saying it, but, “Your God-consciousness is showing!”

Have you noticed that _The Urantia Book_ places definitions of God-consciousness conspicuously in the last sentence of the Foreword and the first sentence of the last paragraph in the entire book?
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> “...the ever-progressing reality of personal religious experience—God-consciousness.” <a id="a49_88"></a>[UB 0:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_12)

> “And god-consciousness is the equivalent to the integration of the self with the universe...” <a id="a51_96"></a>[UB 196:3.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_32)

The entire teachings are held in the arms of Godconsciousness. At every level of our progress, it is the continuous effort to push the envelope of self, soul and spirit consciousness that constitutes God-consciousness. It is the experience and fact of becoming more real.

Do you feel more real today than you did yesterday? Perhaps it's time to get more real. Come to the Fellowship's Summer Study Session 09, “God Consciousness - A Living University” Friday, July 31st through Sunday August 2nd, at Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois. There is a preconference retreat and other activities beginning on Wednesday evening, July 29th through Thursday, July 30th.

In this session we will explore avenues to reach heightened states of God-consciousness no matter what 'level' we are on, or think we are on. This includes:

* Revelatory-inspired learning methods, action study and immediate application of what is learned.
* Expanded pre-conference day with choices of:
  1. Spiritual Retreat
  2. Education Workshop or
  3. Chicago City Tour
* Launch of an ongoing program of in-depth study of the teachings that begin with an exciting new program of prestudy for the 2009 meeting.
