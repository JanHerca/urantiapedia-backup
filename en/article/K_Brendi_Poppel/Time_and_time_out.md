Time is a measure of material momentum, 
But when time stands still.... 
The universe whispers a song to my soul, 
For an instant my heart is fulfilled. 
Here and there we can taste of eternity, 
In the silent spaces where no time exists, 
Where God speaks in the language of lovers, 
Unlike the manipulations of materialists. 
In the mechanistic mold which we have made, 
Our days are divided into segmented spaces, 
This business prevents the Spirit from penetrating 
The prison we have built to encase us. 

Time out from the tumult of non-stoppable action! 
The never-ending traffic that pollutes our view, 
Time out from the scheduled sequence we follow! 
The essence of eternity can hardly break through ... 
The cacophony we’ve created, the commotion and clatter, 
We sabotage ourselves with meaningless chatter. 

I behold you in love, and then do I see ... 
Time suspended, transcended ... eternity ... 
Where lives intertwine in the cosmic design, 
With each one included in the indelibly divine 
Pattern we perceive, the Masterful Plan, 
Is a blueprint to believe beyond this life span ... 
Time is but the beginning, our entry on earth, 
A passage that presages our spiritual rebirth. 
When we take time, we open the door 
To the Spirit, who is waiting for the call, 
To come into our hearts and transform our lives, 
By opening our eyes to the WONDER OF IT ALL !!!
