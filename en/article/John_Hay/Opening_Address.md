by John Hay

What I am about to say, I believe, for I speak not from text books nor theological courses, but from the heart, and from my own experiences and those of others. I believe the word of God, and love him, and my faith in Jesus Christ is irrevocable. I have no doubts, no reservations, no hesitations in my belief in him, the living Christ. Jesus is first in my life, and without his hand on me, I am absolutely nothing, and I thank him for giving me life.

All that I do is for God, with the accolades going one way, to him. In whatever I do, my goal is simply to be his servant in conveying the message of Christ, which is rooted in love. I accept Christ as the way, the truth, and the life. However, I support, acknowledge, and encourage the spiritual truths found among all people, because we all share a common destiny, unity in God.

I believe in the message of Christ, with its foundation of love being the conduit through which God works. And how he works in each of our lives is found in our own personal relationship with him. I believe in the power of God, and not of man, and only through God can we achieve a world more human and more divine. The only thing I can do is speak his truth, and then rely on him.

The sun shines and the rain falls on all people. God doesn't have any favorites, nor is there any exclusivity with him. He works in the freedom of personhood, and I won't judge or undercut or ridicule the faith of any person — that's not my concern. Where that person is in his or her relationship to God is only between that person and God. What s critical in today's society is that the dignity of all people be preserved. We have to respect where a person is at his or her time in life. How can we accept God as our Father, from whom we all come, and then discriminate against others, and look upon our personhood differently, and not acknowledge the equality of all people?

My belief is in the divinity and doctrine of Christ. If I can, in my small way, spread his word of love, then to me, that's enough. I trust and know my God, and I believe in his power, and his promises to us, and in his ability to fulfill them. I believe that when all people of all nations accept and adopt the simple message of Christ, which can be summed up in one word — love — then, and only then, can this earth have the total joy and peace that he promised.

Why are we sometimes deaf, dumb, and blind when we search for God in this world of ours? What was said thousands of years ago is applicable today. When the Holy Spirit spoke, she told our ancestors through the prophet Isaiah, “Go to this nation and say, You will hear and hear again, but not understand. See and see again, but not perceive, for the heart of this nation has grown coarse, their ears are dull of hearing, and they have shut their eyes for fear they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be converted and healed by me.”'

What's interesting is that man is always on some type of quest, crusade or campaign as she or he searches for God and tries to make this world more livable. We have gone the way of the peace march and the walk for desegregation. We have tried sit-ins, protests, civil disobedience, and we have even resorted to wars, or whatever the “in” thing of the day happened to be. You name it, man has tried it. We have tried it all, and what has it gained us? We see temporary relief in some cases, total failure in others, and hollow victories in still others. Doesn't it seem odd that even though our quality of life has improved greatly in most of the world, that anxieties, fears, mistrust and threats have grown right along with it?

What happens to us? Do we get our priorities turned around as we become involved in this world of ours, or do we get confused with all the slogans, movements, and every conceivable structure known to mankind? And to what, and to whom, do we relate? The structure or the simple command of Jesus Christ, to serve and love God and one another? Why do we thrive on competition? I'm not referring to individual creativity and competition in the world of sports and business. No. I am referring to the small thinking and pettiness of “oneupsmanship” in our everyday encounters. At times, it seems that without conflict and competition among people in one form or another, we would be lost. What is it that drives us in that direction? Don't we think we're deserving of peace and love and self-respect? Are we not children of God?

Our heavenly Father, through Christ, is calling all people to himself, and enlisting them in this ongoing and love-inspired adventure. He is always there, ready to guide us on this incredible journey with the same enthusiasm that we have in pursuing it. His children, doing his work on earth.

I ask you, if God is for us, who is against us? We have got to believe, believe in ourselves, believe in all people, no exceptions. Believe that the power of Christ can transform people, who will in turn radiate this earth of ours with love.

Love is in us, and is always straining to be released. The power of love based on Christ is a force so powerful that it is incomprehensible. We all know it, and all we have to do is accept and bring it to our conscious mind.

Enthusiasm, generosity and love, these are the things that ignite us. We need to accept our human responsibility out of love and not fear.

So, we may or may not choose to print signs or join activist groups or have long mental dissertations to arrive at some exotic plan of action, for activity without love has no permanent impact on life. Nor do we have to wait until Sunday, or some other day. Today is the day. We can begin now. And it's simple and it's exciting, and all we have to do is put on Christ, live life to the fullest and love one another.

Lip service takes us just so far. It's not just a matter of practicing what we preach, but it goes beyond that into our normal, everyday encounters. And if we don't follow through in promises to one another and commitments to one another, how can we build the trust relationship that's needed to install love in our lives? People like to get involved when they feel they can benefit. However, whether or not we interact with one another, each of us affects the other person's life. That's a plain and simple fact. There's a natural impulse and mutual advantage to helping one another, for we are all one in God. The common denominator is not religion, but it is God, who is love. God is a 24-hour commitment every day of our lives. Religion is a means, and God is an end.

Love is contagious, and so is happiness. Our love, and the love and power of Christ, is a force so strong that nothing on this earth can resist it.

Instead of competition and fragmentation, we need to encourage cooperation among the various religions and service organizations by simply acknowledging to all people that the underlying purpose is to spread the kingdom of God. The message of Christ has always been love, and it hasn't changed. Although we may use different methods and take different roads to accomplish our goals, they all lead to the kingdom of the one God, a kingdom that is universal, a kingdom of truth and life, a kingdom of justice, love and peace.

When we as a people, one by one, put on Christ, and live and love one another, then the answers to the problems that beset this world of ours will become apparent through the process of love. And therein lies the basis for peace and the renewal of the family, the answer to injustice, drug addiction and abuse, and therein lies the basis and answer to solve the hunger and poverty problems that exist in this world. The solutions are there. With faith we can do it. As our minds and hearts accept the love of God and then, planted in love and built in love, we become more like Christ, we will know what to do as the words turn into deeds, enabling us to live life to the fullest as we love one another.

Isn't it about time that all the words and pledges of all institutions and structures have a common goal: a goal to create a world more human and more divine? Or, once again, will the words of the prophet Isaiah ring true, as he says, “You will hear, and hear again, but not understand, see and see again, but not perceive.”
