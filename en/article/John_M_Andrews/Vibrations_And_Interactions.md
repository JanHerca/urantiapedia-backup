All of finite reality is vibratory; even our personal interactions with our environment are cyclic, in the sense of there being an ebb and flow in our relationships over time. In any duality or dimension that we can imagine, there is movement along that line-even to the changing of direction-although some of the periods may be so long as for us not to have experienced the fullness of their complete cycle. Everything changes; and everyone interacts with his environment or he ceases to exist. Taken together, all these interactions are finite reality, and their cumulative and super-additive effect is the Supreme Being.

We become conscious of the Supreme as we become aware of the fact, meaning, and value of all the finite interactions that we experience. Our environment acts on us through the vibrations that impinge upon us, and we perceive this flow tide through the various levels of our consciousnes5. Likewise, in all our willful reactions to our environment, we put out an ebb tide of vibrations that contributes back to this sea of finite reality.

The clarity and scope of our individual perceptions and the strength and quality of our individual reactions also change over time, as we grow toward perfection. Each personality, being sovereign in the realm of his part of the interactive cycle, may, when the times come to listen, open his mind to the Father's will; and when the times come to act, do so in the spirit of making his every act a manifestation of the Father's will. Thus may ever more of this sea of vibrations _be_ his evolving perfection — even to supremacy. It all gets better as we each get better, and so evolves the Supreme.

And even this master cycle, whose current phase we see as the evolution of the Supreme, this tide too will turn. In the fullness of time, when all the universe of universes is settled in light and life, then will a vast new phase begin — a phase, no doubt, of ministering back to the imperfection of the next universe age, somewhere in the outer space levels. And as these ages pass, we will enjoy an eternity of perfected service.
