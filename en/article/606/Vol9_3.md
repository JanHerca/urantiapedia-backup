## A Note From The 6-0-6 Team

Programmes for the South Pacific Regional Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers, which will be held at Ranelagh House, Robertson, N.S.W. on 10th — 14th October 1988 have been sent out. It promises to be a great event. Kathleen Swadling reports that there are still vacancies for people who have not as yet registered, but would like to do so. Contact:

Ken and Betty Glasziou from Maleny, Qld, attended the first Scientific Symposium for students of _The URANTIA Book_, which was held at Nashville, Tennessee, USA, on May 13-15. We hope to bring you their report in our next issue.

Christopher and Bridget Billington from W-Tree near Buchan, Vic. have left for a holiday in the U.K. and hope to visit some U.B. readers both in England and Finland as well as calling in at Findhorn in Scotland.

If you think the URANTIA Movement in Australia has been very quiet lately, you are right. We seem to have gone underground. But the books are mushrooming everywhere. The sale of 200 books in 14 months through our bookfloat proves you can't keep a good thing down. Also study group activities in Melbourne and elsewhere are growing steadily. One roving study group is attracting quite a few young families who are all very keen to take their turn in hosting the group.

From W-Tree we heard that one new member of the study group works as a radio operator on one of the Kingfisher Rigs in Bass Strait. He was relating how the inter-rig helicopter took a URANTIA Book as its cargo on the journey up and A Course of Miracles on its return flight. Talking about mushrooming everywhere!

In Queensland folks are meețing regularly at Joe Hausler's place in Eumundi near Nambour (for overseas readers information — that is pineapple country!)

Sydney has a few new members in its group and your editor visited our friends Peter and Sue Webb, and Allan \& Jayne Lane in Perth just recently. We held an interesting discussion on the certainty of God's existence.

## Evidence of Things Unseen

The inner worlds are constantly revealing themselves to us. Too often, however, we fail to make the connection that would enable us to recognise the work of the forces of light.

The two separate events described below offer examples of the way in which unseen, and beneficient powers can make an impact on the physical world and produce evidence of their existence.

The first is from a moving passage in Malcolm Muggeridge's book 'Something Beautiful for God' -an account of the life and work of Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

The book describes something that happened while the author was in Calcutta with a film crew making a documentary on Mother Teresa. The entire process of making the film appeared to be blessed by an unseen hand. A fifty-five minute documentary would normally take two to three months to shoot — in this case, the crew had only five days. And yet, in spite of the pressure to get everything done in time, “the filming proceeded with quite exceptional smoothness and speed ... there were none of the usual breakdowns. and crises. no bickering and quarrelling”. Malcolm Muggeridge comments that anyone with any experience of filming expeditions would recognize this as “a kind of miracle”. But, he adds, “there was another actual miracle”.

The Sisters of Mercy gather dying people from the streets of Calcutta and bring them to their Home for the Dying where they are surrounded by an atmosphere of love and cared for. The Home has very small windows, high up on the wall — it is dark inside and the lighting very poor. The film director insisted that it was impossible to film in such light, but as there was no time to fetch and set up proper lights he went ahead anyway but took the precaution of filming in a courtyard outside where other inmates were sitting in the full light of the sun. When the film was processed, however, the result was quite the reverse of what it should have been: “the part taken inside was bathed in a particularly beautiful soft light; whereas the part taken outside was rather dim and confused”. The Director insists that there is no technical explanation for the quality of light in the film.

Malcolm Muggeridge's explanation of this act of the unseen forces is illuminating. “I myself am absolutely convinced that the technically unaccountable light is, in fact, the Kindly Light Newman refers to in his well-known exquisite hymn ... Mother Teresa's Home for the Dying is overflowing with love, as one senses immediately on entering it. This love is luminous, like the haloes artists have seen and made visible round the heads of the saints. I find it not at all surprising that the luminosity should register on a photographic film. The supernatural is only an infinite projection of the natural, as the furthest horizon is an image of eternity... One thing everyone who has seen the film seems to be agreed about is that the light in the Home for the Dying is quite exceptionally lovely. This is, from every point of view, highly appropriate ... the Home for the Dying... could not be more restful and serene. So, the light conveys perfectly what the place is really like; an outward and visible luminosity manifesting God's inward and invisible omnipresent love. This is precisely what miracles are for to reveal the inner reality of God's outward creation.”

The other tale of the forces of light impressing themselves on the world of form is also taken from the experiences of a film maker. This time the event occurred in Tibet where, in a valley in the shadows of the sacred Mt. Kailash, an Australian crew were filming a local Buddhist ceremony celebrating Wesak. The ceremony had never been filmed before. Again, everything flowed perfectly and through apparent coincidences the crew found themselves “led” to the ceremony. The camera being used was powered by batteries and in the extreme cold the batteries were only lasting for two or three rolls of film before they had to be changed. During the ceremony, however, one set of batteries powered a whole day's filming. The cameraman found it difficult to believe what was happening — but each time he checked the batteries the camera showed they were still charged: “I just kept filming. It was such an impressive sight. Twenty rolls passed and I thought this is really odd. The batteries hadn't been changed, but the camera was functioning so I didn't bother about it and just went on.” There is no technical explanation why the camera worked on those batteries in such freezing temperatures — yet it did work to capture a unique ceremony which was later featured in a film broadcast on Australian television that presented the idea of the Wesak Festival as a universal festival for all humanity.

Film and television provides a unique medium for the revelation of the unseen powers of light and love. As technology develops it is fascinating to ponder on the mysteries of the universe that we will discover through these tools of communication.

Loving means to love that which is unlovable, or it is no virtue at all; forgiving means to pardon the unpardonable, or it is no virtue at all; faith means believing the unbelievable, or it is no virtue at all. And to hope means hoping when things are hopeless, or it is no virtue at all.

## Two Remarkable Predictions

The URANTIA Papers contain accounts of the physical structure of the Universe, the formation and evolution of the Solar system, the evolution of life, and the subsequent evolution and history of man some of which does not accord with currently held views of scientists. In contrast, there is much in the Book that was highly speculative at the time of receipt of the URANTIA Papers (1934) that has since turned out to be correct.

In my view there are two commentaries that are quite outstanding in that their chances of being correct were infinitely small excepting that they were based upon a pre-existing bank of knowledge. One of these commentaries refers to atomic structure. The other concerns continental drift. There are, of course, many other remarkable comments, but, to me, these two, by themselves, tell me that I have to take seriously, the claims of _The URANTIA Book_ to be a new revelation.

Quoting from <a id="a95_13"></a>[UB 41:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p8_3) we read as follows: “In large suns when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensures, and such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential, and such particles readily escape from the solar interior thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days.”

## Doing God's Will

Not long ago I had a conversation with a devout Roman Catholic who shared a house with a “born again” Radical Christian. He was disconcerted by the Radical's habit of doing all sorts of odd things “because God told me to”. He eventually came to the conclusion that the Radical was using the conviction of divine guidance to justify his own prejudices and preconceptions, and to avoid doing the intellectual work of adjusting his ideas to the reality of his experience. Anytime a problem arose it would be dealt with by a direct and immediate appeal to God. The impulsive “solution” which then came to mind was invested with absolute authority (“God told me”) and further discussion of the question was rendered irrelevant.

It is not difficult to imagine some of the problems which could grow out of this kind of procedure. But nevertheless it has procedure may be summarized as:

## Value For Money

When you buy something you pay for it. You exchange your measure of worth for someone else's measure of worth. You make your living by generating something of worth to others. The product you generate has its value set by the worth you give to it; you alone give it its value.

If you value your product, be it time or labour, at $70 and it takes you two hours for you to generate this product, then it's going to take you two hours of work for you to be able to enjoy the benefits of someone else's product if their product has been valued by them at $70. Accordingly it will take you ten hours of work for you to enjoy a product like a colour television which has been valued at four hundred dollars. When you buy a house which has been valued at $140,000 then you're going to have to contribute four thousand of your hours. This of course is a costing of net money, after all of your running expenses and taxes have been accounted for.

If you value your own product at $20, and it takes you the same two hours to produce it, obviously you are going to have to contribute a lot more hours of work before you can enjoy the same benefits.

“Baptism Of The Spirit” BY Robert Crickett

## New Issue Of “The Jesusonian”

As of April 29th, the Jesusonian Foundation has made available their latest issue. This publication individually has a specialness about it that transcends being just another issue of a series publication. It is unique, focused, balanced, and indispensable. If you attended the Maine 1987 Conference, you will remember the superb art work displaying the universe levels of ascension up to Paradise with special pictures of Havona and the superuniverse worlds. These artworks make this issue of 'The Jesusonian' an item which every URANTIA Book reader will want to have and share.

The issue is based on the ascension career and has an issue title about life after death. Descriptions of the many levels of the universe are discussed, photographically complemented and highlighted by the cosmic artwork making this issue an “introduction to cosmic afterlife”. It is so compellingly beautiful that your friends and relatives who know of the book slightly, well, or not at all will all be intrigued and attracted to this excellent work. Your examining the work yourself will make it clear to you why I cannot express its clarity and communicability. Subscribers will receive a copy automatically. Others may buy copies at US $3.95 each; $2.95 each for 25 copies; and $1.95 each for one hundred or more. The address is: Jesusonian Foundation, 620 12th Street, Boulder, CO 80302, USA.

## The Remarkable Amenhotep IV

I was fortunate to be in Cairo, Egypt two years ago. My first day there I was faced with having to spend the morning in the Cairo Museum when all I really wanted to do was see the Great Pyramids at Giza and the Sphinx which guarded them. But I was stuck for what was to be five hours in a cluttered, barely organized warehouse containing the pride of 3000 years of Ancient Egypt. “This is obnoxious”, I thought. Do I really want to spend my precious time in this dreary hall?" And yet, if one wants to learn anything at all about that captivating historic period, they simply must go there. What a remarkable window to the distant past! Go clockwise and one begins to get a sense of chronology; maybe someone didn't just throw all this stuff in here. Over there is a remarkable display of artifacts and statuary from the time of those pyramid builders Zoser, Chephren, and Mykerinos. They were the big boys a very long time ago when lower Egypt ruled the Nile. Keep on going and one will detect the power base of Egypt shifting to the south (or to Upper Egypt as the flow of the Nile is reckoned). It was in this middle period that Egypt reached perhaps the greatest of her several golden ages; when the temples of Luxor and Karnak grew in size and significance and pharaohs were laid to rest in the Valley of the Kings.

In this room here — the remnants of the age of Thutmoses, who presided over an age of vast territorial expansion. This comer is devoted to Queen Hathepsut. How was she so clever to attain the hall of power? I was getting excited now. I thought, “Boy, I can't wait to get past pharaohs Amenhotep 1 through 4 because then there's Ramses, the great builder of monuments. After that it's upstairs to see the complete Tutankhamun. I'll bet there's more gold there than in all of Fort Knox!”

## World Becoming Better 

by Jack Cahill — Toronto Star

In these times of superpower, militarism and nuclear arms, of Gulf Wars and Middle East tensions, Third World poverty and debt, terrorism and hostage takings, it might surprise a lot of people to learn that the world is gradually becoming a better place in some important ways.

Consider, for instance:

* Since 1950 child death rates have been halved in almost every region of the developing world.
* In the same period the average human lifespan has increased by more than 30 per cent ( 46 years to 61 years) and most of that increase has happened in the poorer parts of the Third World.
* Also since 1950 the proportion of the world's adults who can read and write has risen from 55 per cent to 72 per cent. * Since 1946 the percentage of the developing world's 6-to11 -year olds who at least start school has risen from just over 50 per cent to almost 95 per cent. And the.proportion going on to secondary school is up from about 10 per cent to about 40 per cent.
* The population explosion is being defused as birth rates have begun to fall steeply in every region of the world except sub-Saharan Africa.
* While the world's population has doubled in the past 40 years, food production has trebled, so that at least threequarters of the world's people are now reasonably well fed. * Between 1970 and 1986, the percentage of the world's population with safe water supply has gone up from 65 per cent to 86 per cent in towns and cities and from 13 to 44 per cent in the countryside.

All this and more has occurred despite the gloomy facts of stagnating trade, failing commodity prices, declining aid, mounting debt repayments, and a steep decline in private lending that have stalled economic development in many countries during this decade.

Between 1980 and 1985, average incomes fell in 17 out of 23 countries in Latin America and in 24 out of 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall average incomes fell by 9 per cent in Latin America and by 15 per cent in Africa. Only the more dynamic economies of Southeast Asia and the larger, more insulated nations such as India and China have managed to sustain significant economic progress.

The main reason for this is a combination of two factors the communications revolution that allows for quick transmission of knowledge and the much improved educational standards that allow people to absorb the knowledge and to understand and use it.

TWO FACTORS

Still, the statistics from UNICEF show that quality of life, on a worldwide basis, has continued to improve dramatically despite all the economic doom and gloam.

## From Our Mail Bag

To Ken Glasziou:

I do not think the U-Book gave us any false information. Many times they said they didn't know or had been forbidden to reveal certain things to us — but to tell us outright lies? NO. If something doesn't go along with what the scientists now think, it's because the scientists have made mistakes they often do, you know.

To William Wentworth:

About the only form of group worship I enjoy is singing. Jesus was very averse to praying in public (1620). I enjoy group study very much, but that isn't worship. Anyway I never could pray in public. I didn't feel as if I were talking to God. I felt as if I were talking to the people around me.
