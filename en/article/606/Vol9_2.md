## Goal Setting

Ian Esmore, Melbourne

For weeks I've been thinking of writing an article for 6-0-6 that may kindle an interest and elicit a response to attend The South Pacific Meeting of URANTIA Book readers near Sydney in October 1988. An article that may stimulate the thoughts of those readers sitting on the fence. Not enough money, can't get time off work, family commitment etc., all doubts or justifications as to why their presence is not required at a large conference gathering. If we focus on and give energy to the obstacle, then it is no wonder change does not come easily.

In front of me is a New Age Magazine with advertisements for various courses that allow people to get the results they want, to gain a clearer sense of direction, to overcome obstacles, to empower the positive aspects of ourselves.

Recently I went to an activity study retreat of two weeks duration. There were more than 70 people in attendance and many had major obstacles to overcome in order to attend. All obstacles were overcome because there was a genuine desire to experience that event and the desire was kindled by the realization of the spiritual growth and inspiration that is achievable through such gatherings.

Changing Urantia starts with first changing the attitudes in ourselves. A slight change in consciousness to envision the friendship, understanding and spiritual upliftment that comes through experiencing these gatherings and how these gifts stay with us providing inspiration and energy to go back into the world and change. Change brought about by a real experience of sharing with fellow Urantians coming together in a spirit of cooperation from all corners of Urantia.

## Group worship

Some time ago, while experimenting with group worship with a few other readers, I was struck by an apparent incongruity in what we were attempting. We were taking turns in talking to God on behalf of the group, and it was clear that we were all asking God to do something, in the hope that He would thereby be influenced to do something He would not otherwise have done. For example, we were asking God to give us the wisdom to understand a certain situation, expecting that this prayer would somehow cause him to “give” us the sought-for wisdom — something He would not have done without our prayer. In other words, we were expecting God to be influenced by our prayer to depart from his normal habit and do something He would not otherwise have done.

## Ever Stuck For An Answer?

Can you remember how you attempted to explain to someone just “who” wrote The URANTIA Book? Do you remember the reaction to such a revelation or did it contribute to a rejection of the book?

I have always found this to be one of the first questions asked by a new reader, and in the past, one of the most difficult to answer. Very few people, in my experience, are ready to accept that a multitude of celestial beings could write a book and have it published here.

Those of us who have studied the Book and possess the added advantage of hindsight and a much expanded perception of reality, realise how relatively unimportant knowledge of authorship is in the URANTIA Revelation and rarely emphasise this matter.

Over the last decade I have solved the problem of explaining authorship of the book by saying: “I could easily reveal the authors but I would be denying you of one . of the most satisfying discoveries you can make for yourself as the authors are fully revealed within the book.” I further explain that revealing the authors would be similar to telling “who did it” in a mystery writer's book. Most agree with this explanation and I have never lost a potential new reader because of it. Hope you find this idea useful.

## Misinformation In _The Urantia Book_?

The possibility that _The URANTIA Book_ may contain serious misinformation came to me as I reflected on some of its statements about material aspects of matter and on historical events that may be shown to be untrue. Let me first affirm that I have total faith that _The URANTIA Book_ is what it claims to be, a revelation originating from divinely authorised sources.

The problem associated with belief in miracles and miraculous healing have always intrigued me. The effects of the mind on the health and healing of the body as well as the reality of the placebo effect in the healing process have become well recognized in modern medicine. _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that some of the healings associated with the ministry of Jesus were true miracles, but that many healings were due to the interaction of mind and faith with the body's own natural healing processes.

## The Arrival Of God Into A Human Mind

When I was five years old my six year old brother and I were taken to one of the churches in our small country town by our parents. Mum had been told by her careers advising father that I was to grow up to be a minister: “So expose him to the church, won't you!” ... and she did just that, rather zealously.

**The First Step Upon The Path**

This particular Sunday was quite an occasion for this church. It was the day to host a visiting evangelical troupe “on a mission from God”. The troupe comprised about eight people and the speaker, who spoke to a packed audience for some time. He probably covered a great many aspects of the Christian gospel, most of it going over my head, but impressed me very deeply with a single issue the idea of the reality of God, the personal author of everything.

## Why?

Why do we wait till a person's gone 
Before we tell his worth?
Why do we wait, why not tell him now
He's the finest man on earth?
Why do we wait till a person's gone
To send him flowers galore,
When a single rose would have meant so much
If we'd taken it to his door?
Why do we wait till he cannot hear
The good things that we might say?
Why put it off, why not tell him now
And share in his joy today?
Of course we're busy, that's our excuse, 
But why, oh why do we wait
To tell a person our love for him 
Until it become too late?

## Ingredients For Problem Solving

How fortunate we are to have problems in our lives.Upheavals to cope with, illnesses to bear, family pressures and arguments, differing opinions thrown at us from all sides. Unemployment.

Ever feel that you are “caught in the middle”? Can't cope?

Pressures at work, more decisions to make. The irate customer to deal with — and the anxious and uncertain one. Deadlines to meet. Stress. Tension.

Critical illness of a child or someone close to you. And, also, the loneliness following the parting on this earth with a loved one.

Do you ever feel that you can't take much more?

of course we can take heaps more.

## Turning It Over In My Mind

I sometimes awake hefore dawn, and having satisfied the calls of nature, return to bed to lie quietly with my mind going through the motions of listening to the Thought Adjuster. While I don't know what that means, I am sure it is essential to keep the body still for a start. My mind drifts off into some analytical or planning sequence, and I let go of the consciousness of the Thought Adjuster. The mind sequence eventually reaches an impasse, and, as if to pass the buck, the mind wakes up the body, forcing it to turn over. The mind now has to cope with the task of conforting the body, and the impasse is put 'out of mind' for the time being. If the body refuses to be comforted another impasse arises, and the mind wrenches the body over again, leading to the familiar 'tossing and turning' pattern.

One morning recently I was shown this correlation between the mental impasse and the sudden feeling of bodily discomfort which leads to body movement — turning over. The way 'through the impasse' is evidently for the higher level of the mind to recognise the peevishness and frustration of the lower level of the mind in time to block its call to the body which is really quite comfortable as it is. It is a similar activity perhaps to the art of curtailing an unwanted dream without waking.

## Reminder!!!

Cheques to be made out to “UB Fund”.

Telephone enquiries to Kathleen or Trevor (02) 9137893

The article by Kathleen Swadling was great. Especially that last part about URANTIA Groups staying out of politics, but wouldn't it be nice if our politicians read _The URANTIA Book_? It might make real statesmen of them — instead of mere politicians, which some are,

## U-Book II ?

The other day I received a phone call from a lady working at one of the bookstores in Melbourne which sells URANTIA Books.

“I just wanted to check with you,” she said. “A customer came in yesterday and told me that there is a follow-up to _The URANTIA Book_. Is there any truth in that?” was her question. I couldn't help smiling to myself as I answered: 'No, there isn't. There is a Concordex and a Paramony, “and I explained what they were, how to use them and how to obtain them. ”But there certainly is no follow-up to _The URANTIA Book_.”
