_The URANTIA Book_ has instructed us about the importance of secondary works to get its basic teachings into general circulation (<a id="a36_130"></a>[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10)). Even in western countries that have a literacy rate well above 90% of the population, surveys have indicated that less than one in ten adults ever read a serious book. Which surely means that _The URANTIA Book_ is unlikely to be widely read in the foreseeable future.

It seems a shame to have its wonderful teachings bottled up between its blue covers in unread form. What can we do about it?

For the immediate future some of us believe that there may be potential in wrapping up the teachings of the book into adventure stories and have commenced a project entitled ‘The Adventures of Jesus of Nazareth’, though we may change the name later. The idea is to write an exciting but ‘fictitious’ account of the life of Jesus which will nevertheless convey his teachings. As far as is possible every chapter will contain at least one ‘cliff hanger’ episode in the tradition of the old time western movie serials or the modern ‘soapies’. The approach is simple, you just get your characters into impossible situations then get them out again.

To give an example, let's take the incident related in _The URANTIA Book_ of the “Young man who was afraid” (<a id="a42_109"></a>[UB 130:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p6_1)). Jesus had several lessons to impart to this young man. He tried one approach that failed, so then tried another by asking for the young man's help. Recall that the young man was fearful, depressed, and downcast. The modern soapy producer knows that he has to dramatize situations in order to hold an audience. No problem — we relocate the young man on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to jump to his death.

The enterprising author might place his victim on a high ridge with a thousand feet drop on either side and have Jesus make his approach by talking to the young man while himself moving onto the ridge — it is up to you to invent your own scenario.

Whatever that scenario may be, the lessons to be imparted can be faithfully included from _The URANTIA Book_ itself — which is what the page 43 , paragraph 3 message is telling us to do (please include footnotes to inform our editors of your reference material).

If the idea appeals to you and you are a frustrated author, how about joining us in the writing of the book? Most such incidents can be more or less independent chapters that will find a place somewhere in the life story of Jesus. We can readily organize the names of people and locations to fit into the general theme. What we need is imaginative adventure stories that incorporate your favorite teachings from the book. All of this can be done without infringing the present copyright and, in any case, accords with the instructions of a Divine Counselor. The editorial panel will look after copyright details.

Send your contributions to ‘Book Project, Six-O-Six’. Just a single story would help but don't feel limited. The ultimate aim is an illustrated book, including maps, suitable particularly for teenage and adult readers. We are not aiming at the intellectual end of the market, so please keep it simple.

> The Urantia Book Has Instructed Us About The Importance Of Secondary Works to get its basic teachings into general circulation (UB 2:7.10).

The operation is designed to be a non-profit service to the Master. So don't expect royalties or accolades there aren't going to be any. An editorial panel will be announced as soon as we get it together. Eight chapters are already written in draft form. Serious contributors may write for a copy.

Please send contributions as typed copy, or better, on computer disk in ASCII, Word Perfect, Q\&A, or other word processor that we may be able to decipher.
