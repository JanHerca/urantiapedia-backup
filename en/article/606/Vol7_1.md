## A Note From The 6-0-6 Team 

Welcome to our first issue for 1986. We have some great ideas planned this year for your enjoyment — articles, study information, cartoons, the children's competition, and news from around the world.

A major event this year will be the National Conference in Melbourne on the weekend of June 7 and 8. Keep the weekend free so you can join in the fun.

The theme will be: “The Tapistry of Loving Service”

This year we also intend to make _the Urantia Book_ more readily available Australia wide, with books available through local study groups at a reasonable price. More details later. Remember too that we'd love to hear from you. So do drop us a line.

## 30th Anniversary — An Excerpt From The Urantian, December 1985

Last October 12 saw the attainment of a significant milestone — the 30th anniversary of the first publication in 1955 of _The URANTIA Book_. By the end of this 30 th anniversary year (i.e.1985) more than 143,000 copies of the original English version of _The URANTIA Book_ will have been sold and distributed since its initial publication. Figures for the sale and distribution of the French translation of _The URANTIA Book_ (titled _Le Livre d'URANTIA_), since its first publication in 1961, will reach a total of almost 17,000 copies at the conclusion of this year. Thus, by year's end, the combined total of all copies of _The URANTIA Book_ sold and distributed since 1955 will be about 160,000 books.

Historically, it is interesting to note that during the first half of this 30-year period (or until the end of 1970) about 18,000 copies of _The URANTIA Book_ (English version) were sold and distributed, while in the second half of this 30-year period, more than 125,000 copies of the English version were sold and distributed. Yet another intriguing fact is that it is within the last ten years that almost two thirds of all copies of the English version have been sold and distributed.

While we do not have complete figures for the month of December, it is possible to state that distribution for the English version and the French translation of _The URANTIA Book_ will reach nearly 10,000 copies this year. Distribution for _The URANTIA Book_ will exceed 8,000 copies, while that for _Le Livre d'URANTIA_ will be somewhat less than 2,000 copies.

## The Derivation of Values

At a political seminar in Sydney recently it was clearly understood, that the quality of our political life grows out of the values we live by. The values we live by determine the essence and quality of our entire civilisation; and our system of social co-operation and control — our political life in general — is no exception. An understanding of this fact — that values lie behind all our social processes — is one of the keys to improving the level of our political life in Australia, but it is something which often seems to be overlooked both by elected representatives and by the population at large.

When this same seminar came to consider the question of the derivation of values, however, there was much less understanding. Two capable and courageous women from Queensland, who have been struggling to influence education policy in that state, made out the case for the official inculcation of traditional Christian values, which are often attacked and derided by radical teachers. There seemed to be general agreement that any moral revival in Australia would be based on such values. And it was at this point that I found myself in disagreement with these sincere women.

## The Service Motive

It has been suggested that Australia is the Western World's most secular nation. I leave it to you, to decide whether this is true or false. But another survey done a few years ago, came up with the conclusion that Australians are the happiest people in the world. Again is this true or false? We could start drawing all sorts of conclusions from these statements, if we took them seriously.

If we compare ourselves with countries like India, Iran, Pakistan and a few other ones, where religion plays such an important part in the lives of people, we could say that we are better off without it. It is perhaps true that we do not want to go back to the stage where the religions of fear held people in their grip.

## Encyclopedia On A Disk

In the beginning, there was the book. Now there is the compact disk. Grolier, a Connecticut-based publisher of encyclopedias and other educational materials, last week announced, it would begin marketing a compact-disk version of its “Academic American Encyclopedia” in October. The CD encyclopedia, printed on a shiny platter 4.72 in. in diameter, will contain all the information in Grolier's 21-volume, 9 million-word printed encyclopedia.

The disk encyclopedia will work on a personal computer like the IBM PC, once it is equipped with a special compact-disk drive. This spins the CD platter and translates the digital information into words with a laser beam.

The possibilities of storing vast amounts of information on disks appear to be almost limitless. A single disk, for example, is capable of holding the contents of 540 copies of the King James Bible. Grolier's next project: a disk that will hold both an unabridged dictionary and a thesaurus.
