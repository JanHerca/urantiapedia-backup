## Editor's Notebook

### A Request For Forward Planning

While the clamouring for more freedom of expression regarding the Book may appease some individuals (and damage the Foundation), issues central to the dissemination of the teachings are being ignored.

Are we continuing to be effective in our personal outreach programs? Do we feel we are part of a cohesive movement concerned for the spiritual welfare of our fellows?

During recent weeks, enquiries have been received at Six-O-Six from new readers. Information has also been requested for the formation of a study group and letters from overseas readers have requested copies of publications mentioned in Six-O-Six. People are eagerly seeking information, yet there is only so much that can be done by concerned individuals. Limitations of time and resources mean new readers and new study groups receive only minimum assistance.

It is also noted that the Fellowship has reduced the number of paid staff and is now more dependent on assistance from volunteers.

As a world movement, are we planning for the future? Would we be able to cope with a greater level of enquiry? What contingencies are in place to meet the outcome of the Foundation's action in the U.S., whatever it may be?

It is to be hoped that those people calling for changes could respond to ‘sudden’ events and oversee social progress, with damage control mechanisms in place.

The real work at the grass roots level will still be required — teachers, leaders, study group participants working away quietly. Surely the ownership of copyright and symbols has never, in itself, attracted ne iv readers.

The willing workers, however, may need support from a respected and professional organization which understands the marketplace, an organization that can bring harmony and motivation, one that can relate to the many religions, the media, all UB organizations and readers and one that addresses the longer term planning requirements for the shortcomings even now evident.

### The Story Of The Urantia Papers

A booklet entitled ‘Birth of a Revelation’ has been written by Mark Kulieke, a son of forum members and a long-time student of the Papers.

It gives an account of the history of the Urantia Papers from 1906 to 1955 and contains information published for the first time. Copies may be obtained ( $US5 plus $US1.25 handling) by contacting:

## So They Say

**The Australian**

Astrology is a substitute for religion. People running religions don't tend to absolve people of responsibility for their actions, whereas in a lot of these new-age things the only responsibility is to feel good about it. Astrology is the ultimate cop-out. It denies free choice.

**Omni**

The search for perfection cannot stop with genetic engineering. It demands the technological re-design of human life as a whole. It demands the creation of an artificial environment designed to protect us from all the natural inconveniences and hardships that make life less than perfect.

**Psychology Today**

Our changing society has brought with it changes in the social meaning of age-blurred boundaries between the periods of life, new definitions of age groups, new patterns in the timing of major life events and new inconsistencies in what is considered age-appropriate behaviour.

**Success Magazine**

Getting to governments is not the major priority. It's very difficult to change people's minds that are already made up. When you convince people at the grass roots

* level, governments, business, everything changes as a result.

## Letters To The Editor

### Virtually Indefensible

_by Norm Du Val, Montana, USA_

In the article by Ken Glasziou concerning the Kristen Maaherra case, Ken mentions another article called ‘Time Bombs2’ which contains URANTIA Book material that supposedly “would be virtually indefensible in a public debate against skilled and hostile interviewers.” Here's some rhetorical questions (and some not).

Does this mean we can't defend _The URANTIA Book_? And if not, why not? If we can't defend it, should we believe in it at all? Should we believe in something that may be ‘virtually indefensible’? Could Jesus himself defend it, and would he? Oh dear me, this sounds like a real problem, but is it? The answer is NO.

We know the planet is way off path. This has caused a distorted view of reality for most of the inhabitants of the earth. So what if you are in an interview with a ‘hostile’ questioner who has an askew view of the world? Everyone has different opinions about things. You are entitled to yours simply because you believe it. You don't have to explain anything to a ‘hostile’ person. You just tell him or her the way reality really is and let it go at that. That's what Jesus would do, and did. He didn't waste any time trying to defend his religion to ‘skilled and hostile’ interviewers. Perhaps “Don't throw your pearls before swine” applies. Not everyone is going to believe the Book. Nothing can be defended against ‘skilled and hostile’ people. Any belief system can be chopped into minced meat, ridiculed. The Bible easily comes to mind. Some believe that the earth was created in six days. Some believe that Jesus died for their sins. In the end, everyone believes what they want to believe.

What is there to ‘defend’ about _The URANTIA Book_? So what if some people don't like some of its ideas? You can't force people to accept the truth. Don't worry about it. This idea that some parts of _The URANTIA Book_ are ‘virtually indefensible’ is a red herring. Jesus ran into a lot of resistance and hostility. So will we.

Before reasonable, open minded and/or friendly people, time should be taken to explain some of the seemingly ‘troublesome or sensitive parts’, in the context that the Father loves all of his children on earth and He expects us to do the same. But we do not have to, and should not, apologise for the fact that _The URANTIA Book_'s view of reality is far more correct than the distorted views prevalent in the world today.

One other interesting point raised in Ken's article, in regards to the present trouble in the Urantian movement was his statement that, "The strategy being employed by both sides in the power struggle is to bleed the other to death, current policy being to bring this about through depletion of funds." I think it is an error to assume that just because two groups have differing ideas, that both are equally wrong or that both have the same strategy and policy regarding the other. It is very unlikely. Ken also suggests we don't need an organization. This is an interesting idea, but I think it is also incorrect. Even Jesus had an organization. What we need is a good one.

### Contact With The Sedona Group

_By Connie Lester, Englewood, Florida_

About five months ago my friend Norma Hays and I contacted Sananda — White Cloud after reading about the article ‘Caligastia’s Visit' in the Six-O-Six. Sananda White Cloud put us in contact with the one who calls himself Gabriel of Sedona. We never suspected, nor was it ever our intent, to expose or reveal any of them.

Norma sent all of them a card and enclosed a snapshot of herself and her three children. The one who calls himself Gabriel told Norma he took one look at her picture and knew she had numerous ‘Past Lives’ and was alive at the time of Michael's seventh bestowal and knew him personally. _The URANTIA Book_ is perfectly clear on this olden erroneous doctrine about past lives (see <a id="a139_379"></a>[UB 86:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_5), paragraphs 5-6, especially 6, and <a id="a139_456"></a>[UB 164:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_1) under the sub-heading ‘Healing the blind beggar’). They don't use the word reincarnation — they substitute words such as ‘transmigration’, ‘transmutation’ and ‘repersonalization’.

Sedona, Arizona, is a virtual ‘disneyland’ of mystics, channellers, trance prophets and the like, and in order to make a ‘living’ off of the ‘believers’, these ‘channellers’ need a hook, something that makes them just a bit different. And the one who calls himself Gabriel is using _The URANTIA Book_ as a hook, a tool in order to get donations. The one who calls himself Gabriel, claims ‘direct revelation’ from our own Bright and Morning Star, saying they have ‘been chosen’ and if you don't agree with them, migrate to Sedona, then not even an entire legion of angels will be able to help you. _The URANTIA Book_ (<a id="a141_617"></a>[UB 92:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_5)) informs us this is not the first time someone claimed direct revelations from Gabriel and decided they were the ‘chosen ones’.

Norma and I collaborated on a long letter to them especially concerning their teaching and belief in ‘past lives’ which is in direct contradiction to the teachings of the Orvonton Revelators, telling them emphatically they were wrong. We told them about the one and only reincarnation (528:3 ‘Spornagia’). In reply I received a most amazing letter from the one who calls himself Gabriel signed Popeye the Sailorman! As Jesus aptly said. (UB 159:2.1):

> “In the generations to come many who are not wholly worthy will do many strange things in my name, but I will not forbid them”. <a id="a145_130"></a>[UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1)

If you have ever wondered just how difficult it was for Michael, just think of this — even today, with the Fifth Epochal Revelation readily available on this planet, there are still those that presume to know more than Michael, the Midwayers, and a Brilliant Evening Star. Well, I choose to believe those who were commissioned to present the truths in our revelation. I believe them over anyone who teaches in direct contradiction.

I asked for insight into the response and then while reading my URANTIA Book, on page 1641 under the sub-heading 3 — The stop at Ramah — especially paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, I found the answer I was looking for. I wrote to Sananda telling him exactly how we felt, but as of yet, we have not received any further so-called ‘transmissions’ from them. Please inform Australian readers that we do not have a different URANTIA Book. We here in the U.S.A. are not in any better position to ‘lead’ Australian readers.

These people are just clever hoaxers, and don't think for a minute that the celestial overseers are going to stop them. When have they ever interfered? What about the bible, is it not full of clever deceptions, manipulations, alterations? It is up to us, after receiving all the information we can, to make fair evaluations.

## News Around The World

### La Triennale 1991 Quebec Conference

“A vibrant homage to Michael,” such summarizes the meeting of 65 readers from all corners of the province of Quebec, who, during two and a half days, came to exchange their experience of the Fifth Revelation.

From Friday evening, the joy of meeting again and the pleasure of sharing became unified in a song that quickly became the hymn for our stay on Jerusem. Thanks to Andre Leonard Glen for this beautiful creation.

Witnesses, conferences, and workshops were successful during Saturday, leaving the opportunity to participants to express themselves about what the Revelation has brought to them, about how it has changed their lives, and about how it inspires us for the future.

### 1993 International Congress

_from “Reflectivity” No. 57, 1991_

The Conference will be held at St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, from 31 July to 5 August 1993 at the heart of French culture in Canada. We are proud as Quebecians to be hosts and to be at the base of the organization.

Following on from the Congress held at Snowmass in 1990, where almost 1000 readers shared in the theme, ‘Walking with God’ the organizers have sought to pursue this method of internationaliastion in making a further step towards planetary conscience. Thus we have chosen the theme ‘Touch the World’ for this next worldwide meeting of readers.

The mission that the organizers have given themselves is the following: To render peeople more conscious of the action of the Supreme and to permit better communication between them on a world wide scale in making a call to LOVE.

### From Boulder, Colorado

The ‘Urantia Sojourn’ magazine continues to publish. It is an independent, satirical production and unashamedly anti-Foundation.

Its collection of articles reports on the political workings of the URANTIA movement. Currently it is addressing issues of book availability, legal battles, and the role of the Foundation.

### Life Goes On

Publishers Longman Cheshire have launched a new book called ‘The Death of Forever: a new future for Human Consciousness’ by Dr Darryl Reanney.
The author addresses mortality in its physical, biological and religious aspects, and the psychology of the human longing for immortality.

A great many treasured religious beliefs are confronted. For example, the spiritual potential inherent in each person is claimed to await expansion and fulfilment. The most important message of this book is that consciousness cannot be extinguished by death, for consciousness transcends time.

“Dying must again be united with a sense of the sacred, for it is here, if anywhere, that the psyche transcends its human limitations.”

### Dave Elders Retires

At the June 1991 General Council meeting of the Fellowship, retiring President, Dave Elders, delivered his Annual Report, emphasising the need to ensure the broad availability of _The URANTIA Book_.

Appreciation was expressed for David's outstanding leadership over the last six years. The new President is Steve Dreier.

### Changes At AASUB

The Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_ (AASUB) has amended its constitution whereby it states in its statement of purpose that it supports the aims and objectives of the URANTIA Foundation.

The members also decided to terminate any links with an Australian newsletter. All groups retain full autonomy. The Article of Purpose now reads:

“The purpose of the Association is to encourage the study of _The URANTIA Book_ and to assist in its dissemination by moderate, evolutionary growth.”

“It will support the URANTIA Foundation's aims and objectives for the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings.”

“It will have a simple organizational structure of readers dedicated to serving this purpose, without seeking recognition. This purpose is to be sought by efforts to:”

“a) Assist the distribution of _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia.”

“b) Encourage and support the formation of URANTIA Book study groups and their interaction.”

“c) Encourage and support an annual conference of students of _The URANTIA Book_.”

“d) Maintain a readership list and study group directory.”

### The Tradition Continues

The Annual Australian Conference, held this year in Canberra, was a rewarding occasion for some thirty participants.

Exceptional presentations were given, a constructive open forum was held and above all, there was a real enjoyment of our social interaction.

A full report on the events will be published in the next issue of Six-O-Six.

### A New Society

An event of major importance took place recently in Melbourne. A meeting was held to develop interest in and a constitution for the First Urantia Society of Melbourne (F.U.S.O.M.). Further information can be obtained from:

_The Secretary,_
_Pamela Reynolds_
_1622 Dandenong Road,_
_Oakleigh, Victoria, 3167_

### Our Early Days

Advice has been received that further publications reporting on the early days can be expected. There is a new freedom and interest in our history. There will certainly be conflicting reports as individuals offer different interpretations of past events.

It is the beginning of an essential and unavoidable process that is sur to serve us well — eventually.

## A Prayer

_by Alex King Sydney_

Father, please help us to know you 
personally and become more sensitive 
to the leadings of your Thought Adjuster. 
Help us to grow spiritually
that we may truly become a cog or link 
in your universal plans.
Please lead us in developing a real 
understanding between spiritual 
and material treasures that we may 
become better your servants.

## The Forum

_The Forum offers scope for lively debate, intellectual theorising, good old common sense and above all else, honest reasoning, in determining the future direction of the Fifth Epochal Revelation._

### What Do You Think?

_(This discussion summarizes thoughts and opinions expressed by members of the Sunshine Coast Study Group during and subsequent to a meeting on 21/9/91)_

The paper on communication with the spiritual world that appears in this issue of Six-O-Six, was read during the study group session. Mark Kulieke's recently published booklet entitled ‘Birth of a Revelation’ was also read. Mark catalogues ways in which he thought that messages and materials from celestial personalities may have been received by the Revelatory Commission. Two are those described in _The URANTIA Book_ relating to the contact personality through whom the Urantia Papers were received. A third refers to materialization, and a fourth to audio messages for which there is adequate evidence in the Book (see <a id="a266_624"></a>[UB 114:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9)).

Mark also describes a method, akin to channelling, by which a member of the contact group wrote down inner impulses that were apparently accepted by the Commission as genuine instructions. Mark suggests that perhaps all of the members of the Commission had this capacity. One who claimed to have had such a ‘gift’ must have been Emma Christensen. A letter from Thomas and Carolyn Kendall of June 21, 1990, responding to a special report from the Urantia Foundation, states that in November 1980: “Christy had Martin read a message to me which had allegedly come to her earlier in the week. It said '‘Do not become involved in long negotiations with Mr. Weiss. Read page 840.’” It appears that the Foundation acted on this as being a genuine instruction from our celestial supervisors.

### Urantia Foundation Reply

_summarised by Kathleen Swadling, Sydney_

Six-O-Six has received a reply from The URANTIA Foundation in answer to the allegations made by Mo Siegel, of which a summary was provided in the May/June issue of Six-O-Six. The letter received from Mo Siegel was a copy of a letter sent to Lyn Davis Lear in Los Angeles, which has since been sent to many readers. The letter received from the Foundation was a copy of a letter sent to Jeff Keys, the president of The First URANTIA Society of Los Angeles, who was concerned by the allegations made by Mo Siegel in his letter to Lyn. The entire letter will not be reproduced here, but anyone interested in receiving a full copy may do so upon request. The following is a summary of the reply, with portions signified by inverted commas being direct extracts.

“Mr. Morris J. Siegel's letter of March 27, 1991 to Ms. Lyn Davis Lear implies that he is a dispassionate, disinterested observer objectively sorting through the facts to reach his conclusions — rather than an ardent opponent of many of the policies of URANTIA Foundation.” (Mo Siegel is the founder of a separate organization, Jesusonian Foundation, which has sought to use active public relations and high-visibility advertising in merchandising _The URANTIA Book_.)

“If Mr Siegel were more forthcoming about his adversarial relationship with URANTIA Foundation, that would give readers of his letter fair warning that he may be inclined to combine assorted facts with a predetermined purpose: attempting to portray the Trustees as insufficiently devoted to our trust.”

## The Book, Study And Discussion

_by Your Friendly Computer_

**Article adapted from a computer-interactive program in the Brotherhood of Man Library.**

### What Does _The Urantia Book_ Say About Communication With The Spirit World?

This is your friendly computer introducing you to an unequivocal statement from _The URANTIA Book_ that could save you a lot of heartache:

> “_The only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit._” (<a id="a301_245"></a>[UB 150:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_7))

The word ‘only’ in this statement is quite unambiguous and must be kept continually in mind. At first sight, there looks to be three independent spirit sources. However the Book states that “_Regardless of plurality of origin, all spirit influences are one in function._” (<a id="a303_273"></a>[UB 34:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_2)) and “_Only the Thought Adjuster directly contacts the human mind._” (<a id="a303_385"></a>[UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

We need to know what is meant by ‘communion.’ A dictionary definition is ‘to converse together intimately’. To do that via a third party is usually inhibitory to intimate bilateral fellowship. So can there be any really direct contact with angels and other similar celestial beings? The Book says:

The Club

At a recent non-meeting, The Club formulated its constitution. Following six complete readings of the Book, exhaustive studies of comparative religion, attending 1723 study group meetings, three international conferences, and four days of continuous debate, non-members of The Club unanimously agreed on the wording. The original 100 -page document has also been reduced in size. It now reads:

“Love God. And love one another.”

## On Reflection

### Does Anyone Want To Go Buy The Book?

_By June Wilson, Brisbane_

Only twelve months ago, in its cover story, the Uniting Church magazine, ‘Journey’ asked why so few read the Bible anymore. It stated that most people are moving to easily digestible forms of information like TV and video. When they do turn to the printed word, they want it short, sharp, pictorial and easy to absorb.

Familiarity too, is an obstacle. Those who know the stories all too well, long for something new and invigorating. Modern society has conditioned us all for change.

The publication challenges its readers: How can we possibly be satisfied with something so unashamedly static as the Bible? Where are the latest additions? Hasn't God said anything new for 2000 years?

### When A Problem Gets Us Down, If Only...

_by Ann Bendall, Sunshine Coast_

What a wonderful world this will be, when folks who have a problem can turn to others who are experts in assisting in the solution of same. Those who have been through similar experiences and successfully resolved the issue in question can help. Each day the number of self-help groups grows, and with them the removal of so much unnecessary trauma, as people render a wise, caring, listening ear to the problems of fellow human beings.

Each and every one of us, by the time we are in our mid thirties (as a hypothetical date) has amassed a wealth of valuable knowledge and skill in growing both as an individual and a member of society, and all too often we do not recognize the value we carry within our being, nor are we given the opportunity to know the joy of extending out our hand to another person, in caring consideration.

### When All Is Said And Done...

> “_If you would share the Master's joy, you must share his love. And to share his love means that you have shared his service. Such an experience of love does not deliver you from the difficulties of this world; it does not create a new world, but it most certainly does make the old world new._” (<a id="a421_299"></a>[UB 180:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_5))
