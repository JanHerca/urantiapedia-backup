## The Tapestry Or Loving Service

Why did we give the conference theme this name? In a tapestry there are many different colours; There are light and dark colours, warm and cool colours, colours for shading and colours for highlighting. All these are necessary if we are to achieve a harmonious whole. For was it not for the shading in the background, how could the highlight stand out against the rest?

Similarly in a group of people, there are many different personalities. They give the colour to the group. But sometimes it is difficult to blend different personalities into a harmonious working unit.

I think all of us have the secret ambition to fuse with our Thought Adjuster one day. But what does fusion really mean? As far as I can see, it means that two entities, one pre-personal and the other one personal, become as one. They have taken on each other's identity. You can't tell them apart anymore. That's what we are aiming for. To identify ourselves with our Thought Adjuster.

## Outreach Decisions — 1986 National Conference

The firal sesaion at the recent Nationai Conference was taken up with a lively group discussion under the guidance of our chairman Will Wentworth. We set about reviewing our current projects and co-ordinating efforts for the future. Goals could be set in the light of the discussions over the previous day and a half. The time for establishing outreach plans had arrived.

_The Newsletter_: The present level of voluntary subscription was inadequate to fund future demand. The position is to be reviewed early 1987. Fund raising for special projects could be launched via 6-0-6. (For this purpose we have now opened a bank account under the name: Six-0-Six Newsletter) URANTIA Bulletin wishes to announce 6-0-6 subscription details to overseas readers. We will not embark on this expanaion until we have results of the Reader's Survey, review coating and establish the necesaary administrative processes.

_Study Groups_: Their value was emphasised and estabished groups should assist in the formation of other groups, especially for readers in country areas.

_Book Booths_: A Book booth is planned by the Perth Study Group for the long weekend in Jan. 1987 to co-incide with the America's Cup Defence. Many expressed interest in attending. Books are to be made available for sale and display. Advice is to be sought from those previously involved with booths. Accomodation could be provided for interstate visitors. Booths can then be planned at appropriate venues in other capital cities.

_Loan Copies_: From our stock on hand a number of copies could be made available for loan. Please write to 6-0-6 to arrange.

_Advertising_: Virtually no response from newspapers, despite a variety of advertisements over many years. Not recommended.

_Telephone listing_: A listing in the telephone book under ‘URANTIA Book Study Group’ is permissable and highly recommended. Listings in Melbourne and Perth have led people to the book.

_Display Windows_: A great concept! Finding a suitable location, providing a contact number, and having a display copy seem to be the only requirements.

_Conferences_: The June 1987 conference is to be held in Sydney. Details to be announced in 6-0-6. For the conference in June 1988, Australia's bi-centenery, all readers in the Pacific area should be invited to make it a Pacific Area Conference. Specially Fiji, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Early notificetion to readers in the United States is advisable.

Papers to be presented at conferences should be forwarded for review some 6 months prior. Organizers can then co-ordinate the program, avoid duplication, be acquainted with all subject matter and prepare synopsis for agenda and discussion purposes.

_Distribution_: The present policy of making the book available at a discount on retail should be discontinued when the book becomes readily available in the larger bookstores. Activity outside the established book industry would ultimately lead to the book being abandoned by the trade. This situation to be constantly monitored. Mention was also made that it is not our function to import. We should cease and concentrate on the teachings.

It was also suggested that we have the option to make a small profit on books which would assist in offsetting other costs.

_Media Display_: We should recognize opportunities for Wolfgang Borutta to present his media display and notify him accordingly via 6-0-6.

_Concordex_: The third edition will be svailable from July 1986 . Books to be ordered and made available via 6-0-6.

_Appreciation_: A very big thank you to all those whose fiforts ade the conference such an outstanding success.

We reckoned that included all of ust

Neil Francey, Melbourne

## Internationai Committee Chooses Aussie Member

After a recommendation by their chairman Berkeley Elliott, Neil Francey was elected member of the Interational Fellowship Committe and will be serving for a term of six years. Those of us, who have worked with Neil for a while know that he always saw Australia as just another suburb of our planet Urantia, and would greatly welcome the opportunity to serve in this capacity. I think most of us will agree that we couldn't wish for a better person to represent Australia overseas.

Our very best wishes go with you, Neil, on this new venture, one of the many still ahead and waiting for you in your universe career.

## Six-0-Six Newsletter Survey

We like to thank all those people, who responded to the recent 6-0-6 survey.

To all those, who have not done so as yet, how about sending yours off today.

Here are some of the comments we received:

You are doing a great job. I think the newsletter should remain a monthly event, so wo can stay in touch that much more. It's the only contact a lot of us have with other readers and it would be a shame to widen the gap.

Kathleen Swadling, Sydney.

I think children would be too young to appreciate most of _The URANTIA Book_, although a childhood introduction would bear fruit in later life I suppose. 

Mike Taylor, Shepparton.

I was very impressed with my first 6-0-6, especially the well written conference report.

Shirley May, Melbourne.

Suggest you work out a 6 monthly or yearly budget and a total cost per subscriber, and let people know that the donation equal to that or higher (for those who could not afford it) would be appreciated. It's nice to keep giving, but it's not nice to keep taking only, and wo all have an obligation towards each other and to this material existence of ours. Some may not agree, but love is not going to pay our financial debts. We alone have to make an effort. Remember life will not let us get away with any kind of debts, material or spiritual, and payment is extracted sooner or later with terrible effectiveness.

Stefan Cvekus, Brisbane.

I feel it best to produce good leaflet four times a year with many articles that do not necessarily date: I cannot be bothered to read a monthly: Any way of production to make the editors life easier is a good idea!

Michael King, Sydney.

I believe everybody should pay a little amount of money to cover general cost ( $10 or $15 a year, if it is sufficient)

You're doing a great job! I include cheque as support for cost, material and mailing.

I think the Newsletter should have a set number of articles. I mean in each publication have a scientific article, international news of _the URANTIA Book_, the thought for the month, a philosophic corner, interpretation and discussion of some quotations, etc. It will make the work easier for you and more interesting for the readers. The organization is important, it is the dogmatic crystallization that constitutes a danger.

Giampiero Pollicino, Gold Coast, Pld.

Six-0-Six is an enjoyable Newsletter. Pleased to see its growth during the last 12 months. Iris Eckersiy, Melbourne.

I don't think the Newsletter is likely to outreach to new readers. Unless there is a fair or particular public outreach and then effort could be in this direction for one or two issues. I think those involved in the Newsletter have done very well. The standard has steadily increased over the past 12-18 months, and it is in a better position for consistent level of input from readers i.e. readers are using the Newsletter as a medium more so than in the past, and that is a result of greater group energy and zealous editors. Keep up the good work!

Ian Esmore, Melbourne.

## The Thought for the Month

> The religion of Jesus transcends all our former concepts of the idea of worship in that he not only portrays his Father as the ideal of infinite reality but positively declares that this divine source of values and eternal center of the universe is truly and personally attainable by every mortal creature who chooses to enter the kingdom of heaven on earth, there by acknowledging the acceptance of sonship with God and brotherhood with man. That, I submit, is the highest concept of religion the world has ever known, and I pronounce that there can never be a higher since this gospel embraces the infinity of realities, the divinity of values, and the eternity of universal attainments. (<a id="a137_693"></a>[UB 160:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_7))

## Springtime

A study of the Future

Now ‘prophesies’ are appearing among believers in _The URANTIA Book_, it may be opportune and helpful to study more deeply what our book says about the relatively near future.

The most significant things Jesus said about it are to be found in section 2 of paper 176 . On <a id="a145_95"></a>[UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3) he said: “The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new be ginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples. And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an _enlarged revelation of truth_ ...”

This ‘enlarged revelation of truth’ has already appeared, The URANTIA PAPERS. The Master makes it clear that he indeed means our book, because he continues: “... even as he has already bestowed upon this world him, who became the prince of darkness (Caligastia, first epochal revelation), and then Adam (second epochal revelation), who was followed by Melchizedek (third revelation of epochal significance), and in these days, the Son of Man (fourth epochal revelation).”

## A Strategy To Beat The Odds

If the physical universe moves towards chaos... life itself is there to beat the odds. Thus, evolution among life forms occurs to adapt to chaos (changes) in the physical realm and win by replicating itself and carrying on the ‘eternal flame’. Consciousness and intelligence has evolved as one strategy to better best the odds.

Thought is a form of energy, but it is difficult to quantify the energy of thought. Nevertheless, thought can travel (span) the vast distances of space in an instant. The speed of light is like the speed of a microscopic flagellate in comparison. Does thought originate in our biocomputers (brains) or does it exist separately in the universe?

As evolving intelligent creatures we become more discerning in picking up and perhaps transmitting thought. Such a powerful tool must be used correctly, so books such as the Bible, the Koran, Bagavad Gita or the URArmI Book are blueprints or maps for such use. Perhaps the best way to look at it is a bit analytical, in order to holp us keep one foot on earth while we in fact still here. I trust ‘God’ or 'the entire matter, energy and thought of the Superuniverses 100% of the time, I trust myself an average of about 90-95% of the time, but never quite 100% because I an not able of myself to control all of my thoughts or actions. I cannot trust anyone more than myself and many persons less than 50% of the time.

I think many concepts in our world should be looked at on a 50-50 basis, then there is less attachment to the actions resulting from extreme and/ or views of such concepts. This does not mean that we should not act, but the attachment to the actions is in the centre.

Richard Braley,
Innisfail, Nth Qld.

_Editors Note: ‘God’ or 'the entire matter, energy and thought of the Superuniverses... Doesn't that sound a bit like a supercomputer? Jesus always taught that we can trust God, because in our personal expertence we can learn to know Him as a very loving, wise and caring Father of all personalities!_

## Compass and Square

M. Wilson

Life is university, death graduation. 
Are you ready for your career, 
Do you know your destination? 
Have you a map of the territory, 
Do you know your true will
or do you think life
is just time to kill.

## The Journey

Do you know where you are going, 
can you guess what you may find? 
Do you know the seeds you're sowing, 
or the waves you leave behind?

Through the circles you must travel, 
from the seventh to the first. 
All life's mysteries to unravel, 
and quench that all consuming thirst.

To satisfy the eternal yearning 
to be divine; it was the command. 
All the trying, all the learning 
are a part of that demand.

To Jerusem, from Urantia,
the seven mansion worlds are there. 
Leeding onwerd to Edentia, 
you'll be shown when and where.

Next Salvington, then Uversa, 
by now you'rs well on your way. 
Leave Orvonton, see Havona, 
you met the Ancients of Day.

Havona's worlds are one billion. 
By this time you're very wise, 
even if there were one trillion, 
you keep your eyes on Paradise.

Be ye perfect, said the Master, 
like your Father in heaven is. 
Face good fortune or disaster, 
trust your spirit guides in this.

Spirit of Truth and Thought Adjuster, 
gift from Father, gift from Son. 
Mother Spirit, you can trust her, 
She comes forth from Infinite one.

Like a lighthouse in the dark night 
always pointing: That's the way.
For your soul they are the true light, 
that shines for you every day.

## Commentary On Scientific Statements In _The Urantia Book_ — Part IV

**The Origins Of Life**

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the first life implantations were made on this earth 550 million years ago, and that all subsequent living forms have evolved from these original implantations.

More and more one reads or hears on the television that life has existed on earth for as much as 3 billion years, which could set URANIIA Book readers wondering.

The fossil record shows us that life forms existed in the order of 500 to 600 million years ago, and that these forms were relatively advanced at least in respect to their biochemical cellular organization. The intricacy of their skeletal remains implies that they must have possessed the same highly complex system of information storage and the equally complex system for its translation into a living organism that we know about today. This system consists of the nucleic acids, RNA and DNA plus the enzymes, ribosomes etc.
