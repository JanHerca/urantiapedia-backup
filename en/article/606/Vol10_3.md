## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Modern religion finds it difficult to adjust its attitude toward the rapidly shifting social changes only because it has permitted itself to become so thoroughly traditionalized, dogmatized, and institutionalized. The religion of living experience finds no difficulty in keeping ahead of all these social developments and economic upheavals, amid which it ever functions as a moral stabilizer, social guide, and spiritual pilot. True religion carries over from one age to another the worth-while culture and that wisdom which is born of the experience of knowing God and striving to be like him.” _The URANTIA Book_ <a id="a64_619"></a>[UB 99:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_6)

## The Area Coordinator Programme

The URANTIA Brotherhood Administration has been considering for some time a suitable way of facilitating contact between study group, individual readers and the Brotherhood, and has finally begun to appoint Area Coordinators, replacing Field Representatives, and vastly increasing the number of appointees. Appointments are for a fixed three year term.

An Area Coordinator has been appointed for Australia and New Zealand, and as I hold that appointment for the next three years, it seems a good time to explain something about the programme.

The primary purpose of the Area Coordinator is to provide a connection between study groups in his area and to assist them in any way possible. This includes receiving referrals from Chicago, where most new readers first enquire for information, and helping them locate other readers in their vicinity. The idea is, over a period of time, to build up a bank of information about the local readership which can be updated by subsequent Area Coordinators and used to facilitate the interaction of individual readers and study groups.

In addition, the Area Coordinator is expected to be familiar with key policies of URANTIA Brotherhood and to be a point of contact between the local readership and the International Fellowship Committee, of which Neil Francey is currently a member, and Berkeley Elliott the President. The Area Coordinator submits a report to the International Fellowship Committee each year.

I t should be emphasised that the Area Coordinator has no authority to represent the URANTIA Brotherhood in matters of policy. Neither does his opinion count for any more than any other readers'. His function is to assist, facilitate and coordinate, not to dictate, coerce or cajole. But he does want to help, if you want to make use of him!

## Greetings From U.S.S.R.

Our local I-I-group (Independent Investigators) sends you our best wishes from Tallinn on the Southern shore of the Finnish Gulf.

Our Urantia research is going on in full swing, how about you? We welcome everybody who is interested and keen in the Urantia research or any other subjects, having to do with personal spiritual experience of Man and spiritual awakening of Mankind.

Hope to hear from you. God bless you.

## The Father Idea

During my second year of reading _The URANTIA Book_ I happened to be teaching in a school for the mildly intellectually handicapped. One day whilst I was supervising in the Playground, two fourteen-year-old girls approached me and asked, “Can you tell us what happens to you when you die?” I remember telling the girls that I had been taught we go to “heaven” where we continue to live. Sensing that this answer was unsatisfactory I briefly stated that I had done much reading and study on the subject and had discovered that we have a “soul” which is our real self. Then we die our body stays here but our soul and personality are sent to another world by God's helpers where we are given a new body and where we continue our lives.

One girl replied that she had been taught the same thing at Sunday school. However, the other girl stated emphatical1y: “I don't believe that I” I then asked: “Who do we pray to?” She replied: “God”, to which I asked: 'What other name do we call Him?“' She thought for a moment but could not find an answer. The other girl answered: 'We call Him our Father”. I then stated that if God is our Father, then we must be his children. They both more or less agreed. My next question was directed towards the unbelieving girl. I asked: “If you were God and loved your children very much, would you want them to die and exist no more or would you want them to live?” They both agreed they would not want their children to cease to exist. The unbelieving girl still found it difficult to visualise or believe that God is a loving Father who has pre pared a special place for his children.

Apparently this student never knew her own father or the love of one as she was put into an institution at an early age. Her own father had been in jail for same time and her mother could not cope with a large family. The other girl had come from a better home background and had received some spiritual training.

I have now had nearly 20 years to reflect on the technique I used to answer their question and I still believe I would answer any similar question the same way.

Has any URANTIA Book reader ever come across a book written by a German, possibly called 'The Oscillating Universe"? I believe he put forward the theory in the early 20th century that the universe expands and contracts. I would be interested to know if anyone has heard of it.

## World Population

By the time you finish reading this sentence the population of Urantia will increase by 7 persons! By the time you finish reading this article the population of the world will increase by more than 2,500. By this time tomorrow it will increase over 190,000 ... that's 1,300,000 per week ... 6,000,000 more one month from now: 72,000,000 a year!

We have all seen figures like these. What do they mean? Are they true? How will this affect us ? Are there already signs of overpopulation? What should our role be in shaping world policy or opinion? What does _The URANTIA Book_ say about population? Is this a problem serious enough to be concerned about?

This article will address these and other questions, facts, opinions, trends, and solutions of population dymamics, the future of the brotherhood of man on Urantia.

**Facts And Figures**

The current population of America is over 245 million. With an expansion rate of 2.3 million in 1987 , over 18 million since 1980 , in the year 2000 we will have about 275 million people in the United States. Although net immigration accounts for about 251 of this increase, that figure is falling due to stricter governmental control. The birth rate is 15.6 / 1000 while the death rate is 8.7 / 1000 for a net increase of 6.9 additional persons per 1000 already present. At this rate we will have 320 million people by 2025: 308 more in only 37 years.

## Dear Friends

My partner, David Hepworth, and I have been keen readers of _The URANTIA Book_ for some time and we find it increasingly a source of inspiration in our lives. One aspect which particularly appeals to us is the role that work plays in spiritual development and the need for the service motive to augment the profit motive.

We notice that already there is a shift in attitudes in the business world to being more cooperative and holistic, based on higher ideals, rather than being based on self-centred needs.

We are attempting to apply these principles in our own marketing consultancy and into the businesses of our clients. While we are some way down the track, we would be delighted to correspond with other readers of the Six-0-Six Newsletter who may have similar intentions and experience in this area so we can share ideas and try to contribute to the progress of the trend.

## Why Aren't They Knocking On My Door?

> “The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth-co-ordinated life.” (<a id="a144_180"></a>[UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

Maybe people are knocking on your door, asking what you have got and how they can acquire it, but they are giving mine a wide berth.

And out there in the big world I have had a few people observe a difference between me and themselves which they all labeled “crazy”! I have never found this perturbing because I totally respect the right of my brothers and sisters to call me what they will. But what makes me a little frustrated is that I have obviously not reached the stage where God shines through me, where I have this beautiful wholeness of righteousness which Jesus refers to on UB 155:1.5.

Education is that which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.

Ambrose Bierce

---

I shall pass through this world but once, 
Any good therefore that I can do 
Or any kindness that I can show
To a fellow creature, 
Let me do it now, 
Let me not defer or neglect it 
For I shall not pass this way again.
