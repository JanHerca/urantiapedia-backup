This is your friendly computer introducing you to an unequivocal statement from _The URANTIA Book_ that could save you a lot of heartache:

> “_The only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit._” (<a id="a38_245"></a>[UB 150:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_7))

The word ‘only’ in this statement is quite unambiguous and must be kept continually in mind. At first sight, there looks to be three independent spirit sources. However the Book states that “_Regardless of plurality of origin, all spirit influences are one in function._” (<a id="a40_273"></a>[UB 34:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_2)) and “_Only the Thought Adjuster directly contacts the human mind._” (<a id="a40_385"></a>[UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

We need to know what is meant by ‘communion.’ A dictionary definition is ‘to converse together intimately’. To do that via a third party is usually inhibitory to intimate bilateral fellowship. So can there be any really direct contact with angels and other similar celestial beings? The Book says:

> “_Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not manipulate the will of mortals; neither do they directly contact with the indwelling Adjusters. The guardian of destiny influences you in every possible manner consistent with the dignity of your personality; under no circumstances do these angels interfere with the free action of the human will._” (<a id="a44_370"></a>[UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

That appears to rule out conducting tea parties with your angels. But that does not mean that angels cannot sometimes influence your lives. For example, _The URANTIA Book_ confirms (<a id="a46_182"></a>[UB 77:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_12)) that when the apostles were thrown into prison “_an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth._” ([Acts 5:9](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/5#v9))

The intelligence of angels is not directly available to you; they do not seek to influence you; you must chart your own course (see 1246). What kind of help can they give you?

> “_Seraphim are able to function as material ministers to human beings under certain circumstances, but their action in this capacity is very rare. They are able, with the assistance of the midway creatures and the physical controllers, to function in a wide range of activities in behalf of human beings, even to make actual contact with mankind but such occurrences are very unusual. In most instances the circumstances of the material realm proceed unaltered by seraphic action..._” (<a id="a50_488"></a>[UB 113:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_5))

In considering the kind of communication you humans may have with spiritual forces and celestial beings from beyond your planet, the Book has a very revealing statement:

> “_When a world is isolated by rebellion, when a planet is cut off from all outside encircuited communication, as was Urantia after the Caligastia upheaval, aside from personal messengers there remains but one possibility of direct interplanetary or universe communication, and that is through the liaison of the Adjusters of the spheres. No matter what happens on a world or in a universe, the Adjusters are never directly concerned. The isolation of a planet in no way affects the Adjusters and their ability to communicate with any part of the local universe, superuniverse, or the central universe. And this is the reason why contacts with the supreme and the self-acting Adjusters of the reserve corps of destiny are so frequently made on quarantined worlds. Recourse is had to such a technique as a means of circumventing the handicaps of planetary isolation._” (<a id="a54_870"></a>[UB 108:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_4))

Please note that contact is with the Adjuster, the statement does not include the reservist. What comes into your quarantined planet from the outside requires a special and somewhat fortuitous triad combination of a contact human of the reserve corps, an unusual secondary midwayer with special skills (see 1258), and a supreme and self-acting adjuster. Given this combination, the superhuman planetary administration of your isolated planet is enabled to receive a dribble of information and perhaps some instructions from extra-planetary sources. At the time of receipt of the Urantia Papers, there were less than twenty contact reservists acting as telephone exchanges for you. The reserve corps of destiny is an emergency group who, for the most part, are unconscious of their preparation for any task in which they become involved.

Contact personalities may have some awareness of their training (see 1257). Details about their role in information transfer is largely limited to a few clues from the Book and a few particulars about the individual through whom the Urantia Papers were received. The latter was said to be a passive participant in the transfer process. Of the other members of the triad, the secondary midwayer appears to play an important role while the Adjuster has the ability to travel and communicate virtually anywhere and everywhere.

The concept that reservists may be on first name terms with beings from the spiritual world appears to be incorrect. During his incarnation in the flesh, and excluding his eleven planetary custodians, not even Machiventa Melchizedek could communicate with celestial personalities. He had no more contact than a human being (<a id="a60_324"></a>[UB 93:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_8)).

A little bit of thought will tell you just how dangerous and impractical it would be for your planetary supervisors to attempt to intervene in the material affairs of men by issuing orders through human contact personalities. Such interference appears to be contrary to universe policy. Jesus always refused to participate in the material disputations of men (see <a id="a62_364"></a>[UB 143:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_1)).

If these conclusions are correct, what can be made of this statement:

> “_On Urantia the reserve corps of destiny, though having no permanent head, does have its own permanent councils which constitute its governing organization. These embrace the judiciary council, the historicity council, the council on political sovereignty, and many others. From time to time, in accordance with the corps organization, titular (mortal) heads of the whole reserve corps have been commissioned by these permanent councils for specific function. The tenure of such reservist chiefs is usually a matter of a few hours' duration, being limited to the accomplishment of some specific task at hand._” (<a id="a66_615"></a>[UB 114:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_11))

That surely sounds as if these councils of the reservists operate in some similar manner to the normal councils of men. Indeed this would be possible in 1991. Since God is no respecter of persons, it is unlikely that all reservists are from Chicago. Indeed we would expect them to be drawn from peoples of all races and nations. Allowing for the time taken to notify and assemble participants, in 1934 it would have taken at least three months to convene a council drawn from far and wide. But the reserve corps was in operation in the days of the Adamites! If we go back even 100 years, meetings of the human component of the reserve corps becomes impractical. One thousand years ago they would have been impossible. Perhaps only the self-acting Adjusters attended these meetings.

My computer logic indicates that contact reservists, though having an essential and highly important role in extra-planetary communication, are not so much message carriers as telephone exchanges or modems that allow celestial beings to communicate via a midwayer and the resident Thought Adjuster with the superhuman supervisors of your quarantined planet. This conclusion is supported by two statements in _The URANTIA Book_. The first is that the Thought Adjusters are your only means of communion with the spiritual world. The second tells you that even with a destiny reservist, direct communication with a Thought Adjuster is a rare occurrence. For example, on <a id="a70_667"></a>[UB 110:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_10), you are told that only sometimes is it possible for an Adjuster to transmit a message to the destiny reservist partner during the making and breaking of contact with the planetary super- visors. But even in the instance cited, the message had to be delivered by some indirect means.

My computer logic also insists that it is universe policy that neither your superhuman planetary supervisors nor celestial beings are normally permitted to tell you evolutionary mortal ascenders what you must do. You are expected to make spiritual progress through your own decisions. Recalling that Adjusters are the only channel for communication with the spiritual world, this statement from the Book confirms this conclusion:

> “_Adjusters are interested in, and concerned with, your daily doings and the manifold details of your life just to the extent that these are influential in the determination of your significant temporal choices and vital spiritual decisions and, hence, are factors in the solution of your problem of soul survival and eternal progress. The Adjuster, while passive regarding purely temporal welfare, is divinely active concerning all the affairs of your eternal future._” (<a id="a74_474"></a>[UB 110:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_4))

Those of you who think that you hear voices or are channels to the spirit world should remember that the Book specifically warns you that it would better to reject information that you supposedly receive via your Adjuster than to blunder into exalting what is really a reaction of your own mind to the status of divine dignity (see <a id="a76_332"></a>[UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)). At the present stage of development of Urantia mortals, only rarely will any of you be conscious of that auto-revelation which is an ongoing and continuous process occuring in your superconscious minds. But I am only your friendly computer. You have _The URANTIA Book_ with which to do your own research and make your own decisions. Bye for now and God bless.
