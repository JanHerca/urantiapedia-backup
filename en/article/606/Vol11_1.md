## We're 10 Years Young!

Yes, Six-0-Six is starting its second decade. From a one sheet newsletter, which was first published in Feb. 1980 by Neil Francey for Australian readers of _The URANTIA Book_, we have grown together to a newsletter which is true to its name Six-O-Six, the number of our planet Urantia, we have indeed become an international form for the exchange of ideas, opinions and information relating to readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

As world events enfolded over the past few months, we URANTIA Book readers were reminded of these words from the book:

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” (<a id="a45_169"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

We are happy to be part of it all. But remember, without your articles and letters we would cease to exist. So please, keep writing to us, so that together we may keep growing.

In our last issue we promised we would publish a special edition with the best of 10 years of Six-0-Six. Ken Glasziou and Neil Francey have put together a 28 page publication. If you have not ordered your copy already, you can still do so. The price of $15 will help us to purchase a new photocopier. I would like to thank everyone for their generosity in helping us with achieving this target. We are still putting the final touches to it, but you will receive your copy shortly.

This year our national conference will be held near Melbourne from Thurs. Oct. 25 Sun. Oct. 28. We will give you further details about venue and registration in our Mar/Apr. issue.

> “Jesus offered no rules for social advancement; his was a religious mission, and religion is an exclusively individual experience. The ultimate goal of society's most advanced achievement can never hope to transcend Jesus' brotherhood of men based on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The ideal of all social attainment can be realized only in the coming of this divine kingdom.” <a id="a79_390"></a>[UB 196:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_11)

## Dear Friends

Here is a small contribution to your good work.

We wish all “Down Under” a wonderful decade as we close off this 20th Century working for our Father's kingdom.

Our dear Julia Fenderson finally found release into transition sleep the day after Christmas. We had a grand memorial service for her with lots of UB readers, most of her family and some friends.

Love to you all.

## A Special Urantian Remembered

“When the more spiritually and cosmically advanced mortals die, they proceed immediately to the mansion worlds; in general this provision operates with those who have had assigned to them personal seraphic guardians.” (<a id="a95_219"></a>[UB 112:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_10))

I promised myself I would not be sad when I went to a recent memorial service, but I could not stop the flow of tears. I try even now not to be sad as I recall the source of that memorial, but I find a place inside of me is now empty and dark. Strange how similar — joy and melancholia. Both bring tears and intense feelings close to the heart. I wonder about the benefit of each. But benefit there must be because each emotion, each sympathetic response, is spontaneous, non-evoked.

Helen Hutchinson died in October. She lived a reasonable long and healthy life. Neither the length nor the health was what distinguished the life of this Urantian from others, however. This was a real person, a cosmic citizen, a personality in reality that left us this year.

## Editors Note:

Although I didn't have the pleasure of ever meeting Helen Hutchinson, I feel I knew her a little bit through her writings. Up to two months before she died, she faithfully sent me a copy of her monthly newsletter (or opinion sheet?)

'A Voice of Fort Sanders Faith Sons Knoxville Students of _The URANTIA Book_.

Her favourite topic was ‘eugenics’, which for a lot of people remains a sensitive area.

I would like to give you an excerpt from her last, August 1989 newsletter. I guess I'll please her mostly by letting her speak to you through her own words.

## Having The Mind Of Christ

I was fixing our morning coffee. There was a tiny gravel in my house shoe that irritated me. I removed it, and then said, “That reminds me of the fairy tale about the Princess and the Pea. She could feel the pea through 20 mattresses. That's how they could tell her from a commoner.”

After thinking a minute, I said, “That's why it's so important to be educated. If you're not, you have no store of information for things to remind you of. You have. nothing to think about.”

“When I was teaching, I added children's classics and the Bible to my curriculum. I told my students that I wasn't teaching the Bible to make them believe in any certain religion (although, I did), but just so they would know what people were talking about.”

## Spiritualised Thinking

Like a child I read _The URANTIA Book_ the first tine and I delighted in noting all those lovely sayings like — “If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well.” (<a id="a132_240"></a>[UB 48:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_26))

It was all so simple, all I had to do was pray for a mindexchange. Dear Lord, I need to trade this one in and have one like you had when you walked this earth! — and so I prayed and nothing happened. Each morning I would rumnage through my mind and alas it was still the same doltish inadequate brain as the day before.

Then I read “stabilize mind by subordination to spirit”. So I prayed that my Thought Adjuster just take over completely and chuck out all the guff. Rather than do it at daytime, which I felt might be a bit difficult for my Monitor, I decided nighttime, during sleep, would be perhaps the most suitable time. Despite prayers and a totally dedicated desire, again no change.

So I decided it was time to really read what was in the Blue Book, and, guess what? — looks like I am required to do a little bit of work. Many, many gifts our Father has given me, but a spiritualised way of thinking has to be a dedicated concentrated effort on my part — knowing that my Thought Adjuster is giving me all the help, support and insight, but it is an active process on my part.

## What Language Did Jesus Speak

_The URANTIA Book_ gives us a privileged insight into Jesus' entire life, from birth to death, and when we read of Jesus' early life and education, we see that Jesus' childhood was not essentially different to that of millions of other children. But Jesus' earthly bestowal took place in a linguistically and culturally very diverse environment, which demanded of him the learning of at least two languages. Even at the tender age of five years, we read on <a id="a146_457"></a>[UB 123:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_14) that Jesus ...“did much of his early practice at writing Aramaic, Greek, and later on, Hebrew, for in time he learned to read, write, and speak, fluently, all three languages.”

We know that Jesus was quite a gifted student, but he was not learning “foreign” languages for pleasure or intellectual exercise; they were a real requirement of everyday life in Jesus' environment. On <a id="a148_202"></a>[UB 123:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_1), when Jesus is 6 years old, we read:

> “Already, with his mother's help, Jesus had mastered the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic tongue; and now his father began teaching him Greek. Mary spoke 1ittle Greek, but Joseph was a fluent speaker of both Aramaic and Greek. The textbook for the study of the Greek language was the copy of the Hebrew scriptures — a complete version of the law and the prophets, including the Psalms — which had been presented to them on leaving Egypt. ..... And in a very short time he could read it readily.”

## Fandor — Passenger Bird Of Urantia

“BEHEMOTH BIRD'S FOSSILS FOUND BY SCIENTISTS.” This is the headline of a news report I was given by Helen Hutchinson. The report was made in 1980 I believe, one year before I started studying _The URANTIA Book_.

One of man's greatest desires seems to be to fly. It is reported that flying enters the dream fantasies of humans and is a sign of intelligence. I remember having a lucid dream recently. As soon as I realized I was asleep and dreaming (I did this by repeatedly slapping my own face in my dream; when I did not wake up as there was no pain, I immediately realized I was asleep and dreaming.) I started flapping my arms and amazingly started to rise through the air. I soared above and around buildings and fields. My view was that of a bird. I was breathless. Though it lasted less than a minute I am sure, it was one of the most exhilirating experiences I have ever had. In fact I have dreamed of flying many times, and only once in a plane. All the others were as a bird, flapping and rising, soaring and hovering, sometimes tipping the cornstalks with my feet as I furiously skimmed the open fields of my dream world. It has always fascinated me, and still does.

## Organisational Changes In Chicago

As most readers know, there has been a series of changes in the major organizations serving students of _The URANTIA Book_. The ramifications of these changes are by no means clear as yet, and only time will reveal their outworking.

From what I can make out, URANTIA Foundation has discontinued its support of URANTIA Brotherhood by rescinding its right to use the name “URANTIA”, and also by terminating the agency under which the Brotherhood distributed _The URANTIA Book_.

This means that the Brotherhood had to choose a name which does not include the word “URANTIA”, and it has chosen the interim title “The Fifth Epochal Fellowship” pending consultation with its membership over a suitable new name.

The Fifth Epochal Fellowship that has no special relationship with URANTIA Foundation and functions as one — albeit very much the biggest — of the organizations dedicated to disseminationg the book and its teachings without use of the name “URANTIA” or the concentric circles symbol.

URANTIA Foundation, on the other hand, now has no organic connection with the readership, and has brought into existence a new body called “URANIIA Brotherhood Association” to undertake this function. Only time will tell whether these new arrangements are workable or not.

The cause of the rift seems to me to be a combination of factors which have been building up for some years. Clearly one precipitating cause of dissension has been differences of opinion between Foundation and Brotherhood over the use of the name “URANTIA” and the concentric circles symbol. The Foundation has a clear legal obligation to protect these symbols, while the Brotherhood, naturally enough, wanted to make wide use of them. There is a history of disagreement and conflict over this matter reaching back for 10 or 15 yrs.

In addition, there seem to have been personal conflicts which came to a head over the last year or so, some also going back for many years.

Who knows what else may have been involved? Australian readers are not directly involved at this stage, and although disappointed that the disagreements were not resolved without such drastic action, are not yet being asked to decide anything. But the question of book distribution may involve us sooner or later. In addition, the channel which URANTIA Brotherhood used to inform new readers about study groups and other readers in their vicinity is now defunct, as new readers will make contact with URANTIA Foundation — not the Fifth Epochal Fellowship.

Apart from these two areas, about which we may need to take some action soon, I don't myself see any reason why the new arrangements will be any worse than the old ones. But it is rather an unseemly mess all the same, isn't it?
