## Editor's Notebook

A mixture of stories have highlighted our recent weeks at Six-O-Six.

After twenty-five years, a mother-daughter reunion. Each of them was heavily reliant on the ‘co-ordinator’ who aligned their thinking and their expectations, reasoned their associated elation and grief.

The nobility of reward was shared in its various ways.

There has also been a family at war. Business disagreements have spilled over into personal issues, distancing children, and therefore grandchildren. Unexpectedly, a business associate and URANTIA Book reader was asked to ‘listen’ to the patriarch.

Tough practical advice, unrelated directly to the book, was offered. The art of self-respect was engendered in fiery discussion.

And a good friend and URANTIA Book reader received a warning to slow down by way of a heart attack. For high pressure jobs check the Concordex under headings such as anxiety, strife, rest, and relaxation.

Nice to know our book is superbly relevant as usual. Not to mention the love bestowed for a speedy recovery.

Then there are the group meetings, a natural part of life it seems. Sad little agendas can emerge. A political leaning can upset a community project. Lack of a public thank you can harbour a resentment.

All of these unrelated incidents come together, because two or more were gathered in His name. Each occasion, as a result, was progressive in as much as we are learning to love.

Does the development of spiritual insight, from whatever source, fine tune our sensibilities? Enhance our capacity for problem solving? It shows as an attitude of love towards those around us, a forgetfulness of self.

### Isolation

In our very first issue of Six-O-Six, mention was made of the isolation experienced by readers of the book.

This has been largely overcome in the major cities. But a phone call from North Queensland showed the problem continues for so many. Fellowship with readers is indeed deserving of thanksgiving.

### Peace \& Goodwill To All

Before we close our notebook on another year, there's one more very important item to mention.

At this time of peace and goodwill, from everyone at Six-O-Six, the compliments of the season to all.

We look forward to our reunion in 1992, and discovering God's plans, one day at a time.

## So They Say

**Quadrant**

Let Bishops stick more to prayer and fasting and less to politics. For if they were to help bring down our free economic institutions, they risk bringing themselves down to the cellars from which the Church in Eastern Europe is only now hesitatingly emerging.

**New Scientist**

Spending on family planning programs must double in the next nine years, or by 2025 the world will be unable to support its population.

**Time**

Ruined lives. Lost fortunes. Federal crimes. Scientology poses as a religion but is really a ruthless global scam — and aiming for the mainstream.

**The Australian**

Now that attempts to put socialism and fascism into practice have largely discredited coercive Utopias, impending disaster has become the pretext to restrict liberty.

**A Study of the Master Universe (by William S. Sadler Jr.)**

The effective and constructive giver is engaged in a ministry of positive action. He is becoming responsive and understanding in his giving; he is becoming an active and beneficial force among his fellow men; he is a bringer of good will; he is an ameliorater of difficulties and a reconciler of contentions. He is actively ‘waging peace’ among his fellows.

## Letters To The Editor

### Zambian Connection

_Chilufya M K Thompson_

Greetings!! I am a fellow URANTIA Book Reader, a Zambian based in Kitwe-Zambia. I have been studying _The URANTIA Book_ for nearly 10 years now, having been introduced to it by a friend in New York in February 1982.

I was recently impressed by the Study Group Herald Magazine recently launched by “The Fellowship” in Chicago, which I have no doubt you have already had a chance to read. It was after reading it that I wrote a letter to the Editor, Mr Martin Greenhut, suggesting that the magazine carry an International Readers Page. He in turn contacted me and suggested that I pioneer it from Zambia and therefore give it the international flavour it will carry.

We are therefore appealing to your study group to help this cause by sharing with us your inspirations, ideas, studies, and socials. Send us also a photograph of your study group. Write to:

_International Editor_
_Chilufya M K Thompson_
_Po Box 22620_
_Kitwe_
_Zambia_

Best wishes to your group. We look forward to your letters in the magazine.

### Does Not Compute!

_by Kathleen Swadling, Sydney_

One of the delights I experience while reading your newsletter is the lively expression of personal opinion. I find an opinion has meaning when there is a personality attached to that opinion. I find an article written by a “friendly computer” a bit hollow and devoid of personality.

The article I refer to in your last issue was obviously written by a person who expressed opinions and interpretations that could only have originated in the mind of a person. I would appreciate it if the person reveals his or her identity — it would give the article more substance and meaning. Instead of implying “ it is my opinion ...”, the writer says “my computer logic says...” I find this a little off-putting as computer logic is not opinionated. A computer is only a machine or tool for personalities to work with. Let's not get carried away by material technology to the point where we substitute personal identity for that of a machine!

## News Around The World

### Spanish Translation

Andite Corporation, an affiliate of URANTIA Foundation, has made considerable progress toward completing El Libro de URANTIA, the Spanish translation of _The URANTIA Book_. Copy editing is nearly finished, and typesetting began some time ago. In order to expedite production, Andite has hired a technical editor who will help format the text for direct electronic input to the printing press. This technique simplifies the type setting, reduces errors, and makes it possible for the Spanish text to correspond page for page with the original English. El Libro de URANTIA should be available in 1993/4. Copy editing is also under way for the Finnish translation, a project of URANTIA Foundation.

### Scientist Discovers Two New Planets

**From The Independent**

An astronomer in Puerto Rico is believed to have discovered two planets in orbit around a distant star.

This raises the chances that Earth-like planets — and life — exist elsewhere.

These are only the second and third planets to be found outside our own solar system.

The discovery comes just three months after radio astronomers found what they believed to be the first planet outside the solar system, named PSR1829-10.

Professor Andrew Lyne, professor of radio astronomy at the University of Manchester, who headed the group that made the first discovery, said: “This raises the chances that other stars out there have planetary systems around them.”

The discovery of a planet in July, and two more within a space of a few months, improves the chances of finding one with the right environment to sustain life.The two new planets appear to be roughly the same size.

Initial calculations suggest they are about four to five times Earth's mass with diameters roughly 1.5 times as large. One of them seems to be orbiting a pulsar — a super dense star — about 2,000 light years from us once every two months, and the other once every three.

The two planets appeared to be causing their star to drift by up to 900 kilometres over a few months.

Astronomers have long speculated about the possibility that life might be found on planets outside our own solar system.

### Popular Publications

In an IPA Review of school text books on the environment many claims have been questioned.

The most popular book, The Battle for Earth: Today's Key Environmental Issues, tells children that development inevitably causes a population explosion by destroying culturally inbuilt population-control strategies. And the market system is increasing the incidence of famine.

The second most popular, The Gaia Atlas of Planetary Management, claims China has largely succeeded in eliminating malnutrition due in part to its political ideology.

And yet another, Blueprint for a Green Planet, gives an indication to the thinking behind such statements. It tells the children and their teachers that ‘our immediate task is to do everything we can to bring our present life-destroying culture to a halt.’

Reasons and facts to support these ‘life-destroying’ fears are not obvious.

### Temples Of Stone

Almost $40 million is being expended on the new St Mary's Cathedral presbytery and Christian Brother's school in Sydney.

While in Brisbane, work continues, at an estimated cost of $25 million, on completing St John's gothic Cathedral in accordance with the original design.

## Articles

**from “Birth of a Divine Revelation” by Ernest Moyer**

### Origin Of _The Urantia Book_. From God, From Man, Or From The Devil?

Three choices exist for the origin of _The URANTIA Book_. It is human, it comes from God, or it comes from the Devil.

When I first met the Book I had trouble with it. I did not know how to place it within my conceptual framework or Universe frame, as _The URANTIA Book_ refers to it. The Book seemed too far outside my understanding of the world; it was difficult to reconcile with my previous religious views. However, the Book was instrumental in bringing me back to God. That key was in Papers 20 and 21, The Paradise Sons of God, and The Paradise Creator Sons. Suddenly I had a view of a real, living God — not some mystical notion, not some superstitious religious view, not some intellectual abstraction — but a real, living God.

He came from eternity; he worked in space; he designed a universe and all of its occupants; he administered his creation with care and purpose. Those two Papers were enough to prevent me from throwing the Book away.

Then, as I began to read the Book more seriously, I recognized important attributes.

### Consistency In _The Urantia Book_

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Qld._

The previous article by Ernest Moyer on the authorship of _The URANTIA Book_ commented on the significance of consistency for helping to validate the claim of the book to be a divine revelation. After reading Ernest's article, I came across this quotation from Jesus' conference on Mount Gerizim:

> “_The strain of living — the time tension of personality — should be relaxed by the restfulness of worship. The feelings of insecurity arising from the fear of personality isolation in the universe should be antidoted by the faith contemplation of the Father and by the attempted realization of the Supreme._” (<a id="a235_313"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3))

How does one realize the Supreme? I switched on my computer and learned that this phrase occurs just four times in the whole of _The URANTIA Book_. The first quote comes from the Foreword in a paragraph describing experiential-Deity actualization:

### Another View Of The Kristen Maaherra Case

_By Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

Lately, a lot of material has been circulated concerning the current legal struggle between The URANTIA Foundation and Kristen Maaherra. I am amazed that most of this material portrays Ms Maaherra as an innocent victim or a “fall guy”, caught between the “super powers” of the URANTIA movement. Some like to think of her as an innocent pawn in the game, and are even soliciting funds from readers for her defence. However, as with any dispute, there is often more than meets the eye. One very strong point of view in favour of Ms Maaherra appeared in the August/September issue of Six-0-Six titled “An Analysis of the Kristen Maaherra Case” by Ken Glasziou. I would like to attempt to analyse this further in the light of considering its possible repercussions for the revelation.

As we all know, one of the functions of the URANTIA Foundation is to protect the text of _The URANTIA Book_. Article 3.1 of the Declaration of Trust Creating URANTIA Foundation provides that: “It shall be the primary duty of the Trustees to perpetually preserve inviolate the text of _the URANTIA Book_ ...” Article 3.3 emphasizes that: “It shall be the duty of the Trustees to retain absolute and unconditional control of all plates and other media for the printing and reproduction of _The URANTIA Book_ and any translation thereof...”

### Morality Is A Law Unto Itself

_By John Hyde, The Institute Of Public Affairs_

For whatever reasons, even the church has largely given the ‘morality’ game away, adopting the language and values of the social sciences rather than those of ethics. And no other body of thinkers and teachers has filled the gap.

There has been a drift towards nihilism — scepticism about moral principles. This has contributed our present social (including economic) woes.

The advice people receive tends to come from governments — which are ill-suited to moral instruction and to concentrate on legalities that do not distinguish between right and wrong personal behaviour. Indeed, far from being challenged to accept personal responsibility, we are offered a litany of excuses for our own failures and opportunities to avoid their consequences. Words which I admit defy precise definition, such as honour, truth, courage, charity and justice have become passe.

### Transpersonal Pyschology

_by Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld._

Members of a group tend to share common assumptions, both because they attract like-minded people and because they provide powerful selective reinforcement for their preferred assumptions. Any questioning of these assumptions is usually discouraged, or at best, not supported. Assumptions therefore function as beliefs that determine what will enter awareness and what will remain unconscious, hence determining cultural reality.

Seeing through one's cultural belief systems is extraordinarily difficult but may be helped by exposure to other cultures and beliefs. Transpersonal psychology represents a paradigm shift in Western psychology, resulting in part from exposure to cross cultural beliefs about the nature of consciousness and reality.

Psychology as a science is continuing to break the ties with its “father” Freud, a man who opted to link his theories with science, rather than philosophy and/or religion. Freud realized that the great legitimizer of his era was science, not religion, and therefore opted to create an elaborate pseudo science, which, because he stood as a consistent and determined minority, enabled psychoanalysis to be successfully legitimized as a real science. Many theorists have come and gone, attempting to swing the image of the individual from Freud's fundamentalistic image of being fallen children of Eve (although Freud gave a delightfully secular reason for us all being so — heaven forbid that he would mention the old testament, despite the fact that his theories are based on its tenets) and the current 'perspective of psychology, which, in seeking to understand the domain known as consciousness, builds on Rogers belief that folks are innately good ( substantiated by research on the morals of children, who in their pre-school years put their parents to shame).

## The Book, Study And Discussion

**Article adapted from a computer-interactive program in the Brotherhood of Man Library.**

### What Does _The Urantia Book_ Say About Contacting Your Thought Adjuster?

_by Your Friendly Computer_

A well-known Urantian, now residing on the mansion worlds, once said that if you hear voices, a visit to your psychiatrist is suggested — or words to that effect. My computer-analysis of my memory banks would tend to confirm the diagnosis. Here is some of the evidence:

> “_You must not regard co-operation with your Adjuster as a particularly conscious process for it is not; but your motives and your decisions, your faithful determinations, and your supreme desires, do constitute real and effective co-operation._” (<a id="a285_250"></a>[UB 110:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_6))

> “_The fact that such Adjuster activity may be unconscious to the human partner does not in the least detract from its value and reality._” (<a id="a287_142"></a>[UB 108:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_9))

Without doubt it is true that you are unconscious of your Thought Adjuster's activity for most of the time, but there is no need to be unconscious of it all the time. In reality it is quite easy to identify Thought Adjuster activity.

Firstly though, you should be aware that your Thought Adjuster is not just ‘the ghost in the machine.’ Becoming aware that the Adjuster is an actual real and living part of the mind is an important step to better mutual cooperation. Here is the authoritative statement:

> “_Thought Adjusters are definite individualizations of the prepersonal reality of the Universal Father, actually indwelling the mortal mind as a very part of that mind..._” (<a id="a293_176"></a>[UB 34:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_6))

Having surmounted that hurdle, let us now discover the proof that it is true — that the Thought Adjuster and its activity in the mind is unequivocally identifiable. In replying to a voice from the crowd, Jesus once said, “_Why do you call me good? None is good but God._” (<a id="a295_273"></a>[UB 196:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_2)) These words are also recorded in the gospels of Matthew ([19;17](/en/Bible/Matthew/19#v17)), Mark ([10:18](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v18)), and Luke ([18:19](/en/Bible/Luke/18#v19)).

_The URANTIA Book_ states quite unambiguously that, “_all goodness takes its origin in God_” (<a id="a297_94"></a>[UB 8:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p2_7)). It also tells you that you can contact the Father only through his “_fragmented entities_” (<a id="a297_228"></a>[UB 1:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_6)), that is, your Thought Adjuster. It is simple algebra to work out that any good thought you ever had must have come from God via your Thought Adjuster.

So, provided you can identify just one good thought in your whole life, you will know that it signalled that the Thought Adjuster has become a living, active part of your mind. All subsequent good thoughts provide the evidence for its continuing presence, and consciousness of that presence can vastly improve your mutual interrelationships. Conversation with your Thought Adjuster might appear to be one-way, but the origin of those thoughts that come into your mind is always identifiable by their content of truth, beauty, and goodness. Particularly when it comes to conflicts “_between what really is right or wrong (not merely what you may call right and wrong), you can depend upon it that the Adjuster will always participate in some definite and active manner in such experiences._” (<a id="a299_792"></a>[UB 108:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_9)) Always remember that you are never alone.

> “Man goes forth searching for a friend while that very friend lives within his own heart.” (<a id="a301_94"></a>[UB 3:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_4))

Bye now and God bless.

> If one tells the truth, one is sure,

### Canberra Conference

_By Will Wentworth For The Canberra Study Group_

Feedback from the October Conference has been mostly favourable, providing Vern Verass and his Canberra Study Group with the requisite “warm inner glow.” We note that people came from Queensland, Victoria, New Zealand, and Hawaii as well as from the Canberra region, and together with the large Sydney contingent everyone guaranteed enough variety to keep things interesting. Thank you all for making our debut such a success.

Comments have been particularly favourable about Nigel Nunn's presentation in which a high standard of clear thought was matched by imaginative presentation. Ken Glasziou's impromptu scientific input seems, as usual, to have been very favourably received. And Vern's own presentation struck exactly the right note.

The “Hot Gossip” session, which initially seemed to us a bit risky, allowed readers to be magnanimous in the face of opposing viewpoints.

There have also been a few murmurs of appreciation about the pre-conference information. People like to have some idea of what they are in for.

But it does seem as though our experiment with a venue which did not provide exclusive use has been a failure.

To date there have been absolutely no reports that any of the non-readers who traipsed through the middle of the conference proceedings has either bought a book or joined a study group!

## The Forum

### Is It Important?

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Qld._

Are the textual, punctuation, and spelling changes made to the original, first printing of _The URANTIA Book_ of any importance? The Trustees of the Foundation do not think so. At least that is the answer I recently received to my protests concerning this matter. I was informed that my protest was placed on the agenda but was allocated such a low priority that it did not come up during a recent meeting of the Trustees. However it did receive some discussion during lunch. My major concern was with the textual changes. I was informed that since all of these had occurred long ago, during the second and third printing, the current Trustees accept no responsibility, and those who made the changes will have to answer to the Ancients of Days.

Why should these changes be of concern? Here is one reason. Assume that you are involved in translating _The URANTIA Book_ into a foreign language. Which version of the book will you use? The problem is messy because most of us believed that there had only ever been one change, a change that had been corrected at the very next printing. That was the story I was told when I asked a member of the general council of the former Brotherhood some few years ago. This appears to have been the official line at the time, as I received exactly the same story when I asked a former Trustee who had also been an ex-president of the Brotherhood.

## A Prayer

_Jesus, go through the power of your spint, go back into my nemon, Every hurt that has ever been done to me, heal that hut. Every hut that I have ever caused to another person, heal that hurt. All. the relationships that have been damaged in $n y$ whole life that In not aware of, heal those. relationships. But, Jesus, if there is anything I need to do, if I need to go to a person because he is suffering from my hand, bring that person to my awareness. I choose to forgive, and l ask to be forgiven. Renove any bitterness that may be in my heart, and fill the empty spaces with your love._

## On Reflection

### Literacy Crisis

_By Jane Wilson, Brisbane_

“_We have many Christians who cannot read their Bibles, who shy away from study groups for fear of embarrassment, and who do not grow in the Lord as a direct result of their being illiterate._”

_Moody Monthly_

A recent survey says nearly 60% of Americans never read books and most of the others only read one book a year. Books have become commercial property with a short shelf-life, more a source of material for movies and television shows.

Degrees in English literature in the US have decreased by 33% in the past two decades, and English courses in many universities consist mainly of remedial reading.

### What Now?

_by Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld._

The reason as to why _The URANTIA Book_ was given to us was at first of no concern to me. I was so glad to be living now and a recipient of the beautiful book.

As I mixed with other readers the question was often raised and I wondered if we were so far out of line with normal planetary evolution, that Michael's Spirit of Truth was being rarely requested by individuals. So as an eleventh hour measure, similar to the third epochal revelation, permission was granted for us to have the book.

But this did not seem an acceptable reason to me. Why did Michael waive his authority? Why was the permission given from Uversa? This is Michael's very special planet, he has total power and need not rely on precedent where Urantia is concerned.
