## A note from the 6-0-6 Team

With our South Pacific Regional Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers less than three months away, Kathleen Swadling reports that 54 people have registered so far, but that further registrations can still be accepted.

The Scientific Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee was a resounding success. You can read Ken and Betty Glasziou's report in this issue of 6-0-6. We also bring you the second part of Ken's paper “Two Remarkable Predictions”. This one is on “Continental Drift”.

Since our last Newsletter we have had the pleasure of meeting with two more URANIIA Book readers from overseas.

Dexter Cave from Tahiti, who was on a working tour around Victoria and New South Wales had a chance to meet study group members in Melbourne and Sydney. We spent a pleasant and stimulating evening together and Dexter hopes that he and his family will be able to attend our South Pacific Meeting in October.

Dana Poole from Griffin, Georgia, U.S. is the editor of the newsletter ‘Harmony’, which is published only once a year. Dana who is a professor of children's literature, attended the world conference on children's literature in Surfers Paradise near Brisbane. She was able to combine her work with meeting some URANTIA Book readers in Brisbane, Towamba, Melbourne and Sydney. One of her great delights was visiting the Healesville Sanctuary near Melbourne where she could take snapshots of our native fauna and flora to her heart's content. We also showed her a virgin rain forest on Mount Donna Buang near Warburton, where some of the Myrtle beeches are believed to be about one thousand years old and play host to numerous ferns and mosses. With the crystal clear water of Cement Creek running between the fern trees and giant Mountain Ash, the tallest hardwood in the world, it is a beautiful place indeed and Dana had never seen anything like it in her life. We hope she will be able to return to Australia one day to renew the friendships she has made during her short sojourn in this beautiful country of ours.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear — the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.” <a id="a53_368"></a>[UB 195:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21)

## The Second Remarkable Prediction

CONTINENTAL DRIFT: _The URANTIA Book_ states quite categorically. that all land on earth was originally a single continent that subsequently broke up, commencing 750 million years ago (<a id="a57_185"></a>[UB 57:8.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_23)), followed by a long period of continental drifting during which land bridges were repeatedly. formed and broken.

The idea of continental drift was mooted in the 19th century and first put forward as a comprehensive theory by Wegener in 1912. It was not well accepted, being classified with gee-whiz science, and becoming more and more discredited until the 1960s. I can still remember attending a geology lecture at Sydney University in 1951 when the lecturer dismissed the concept of continental drift with the comment that there were no known forces that could wrench continents apart. The change in attitude was initiated by the discovery of long mountain ranges on the ocean floors, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that stretches from Iceland to Antartica. During the 1960 's, careful examination of the ocean floor revealed that the rock from the Earth's mantle is being melted, then forced upwards resulting in sea floor spreading. This upwelling would be expected to push the continents apart, and thus provided the missing evidence for physical mechanism that could bring about continental drift. However, it was not called continental drift, and instead was given the more scientific name of plate tectonics.

## Baptism Of The Spirit

It's May 201988 and the phone rings. The caller pleads for an immediate consultation. Presently I have before me a young woman who is steeped in the beliefs of magic and the occult. She is suffering throat constriction and severe chest pains. Her opening comments are of her chronic fear once again being projected onto her new-found lover, a fear that he will leave her ... the very same fear which led her to behave in such a way as to prompt the rapid departure of her last lover.

During the course of our counselling session she tells me of an overwhelming hatred for her European and presumably migrant parents. This hatred extends with equal vehemence toward herself. She abuses her body, her emotions and her thinking by lustingly despising their very existence. She knows no satisfaction in any quarter of her life save the faint hope that one day she will master her sorcery and somehow be with God. She hates her job, a menial factory position. She has few friends outside of the odd occultist. She tried reading the Bible but couldn't make any sense out of it. She likewise tried reading _The URANTIA Book_ and made even less sense out of it. The fruit of many years of devoted self-tutored research into magic as her quest for God and the benefits of spiritual salvation have little to show for all of her effort. She has a fascination and an obsession with trance states, communicating with non-humans and the dead, conjuring up energies and powers who will be allies to her in her quest for the superhuman, the sexually satisfying, and the powerful. She is racked by a heart-breaking loneliness and separation from God and from people, even from like-minded people who equally research life's value in sorcery and magic. Here before me is a woman not unlike many people these days, desperate for help with her physical condition but also her spiritual condition.

## Report On Scientific Symposium

The first Scientific Symposium for students of _The URANTIA Book_ held at Nashville, Tennessee May 1988, was attended by approximately 200 people and was a resounding success, hence is likely to be the first of many. Contrary to what I expected, few of the papers were directed towards discussion of points of contention between current scientific thought and scientific statements in _The URANTIA Book_. This was probably due to the fact that most of those attending were long time and convinced readers of the Book, most belonged to long established study groups, many knew one another, and presentations were more in the nature of scientific education and discussion. The papers presented are to be published shortly, I think copies are to be sent to those who attended, but regardless, George Samis from the Brotherhood of Man Library will be sending us a copy on disk so 6-0-6 is assured of getting the papers.

More along the lines I had anticipated, Matt Neibaur presented a paper in which he had selected from _The URANTIA Book_ on the life of Jesus, 8 different dates to which a definite day of the week can be assigned. Matt explained how, over the centuries, our calendars had been adjusted and modified up to the time when the Gregorian calendar was introduced at which date the calendar was months out of phase with the actual seasons of the year. Because of the mucking about with the calendar that had taken place, it seems that it requires a good computer program or else years of work to get your days and dates right for the period of Jesus' ministry. Matt's computer showed that _The URANIIA Book_ has got the date and the day of the week right for all of the 8 occasions that he investigated.

As to the Conference itself, Betty and I benefited immensely by making personal contact with many people who have previously been only names, and of course many who were previously completely unknown to us. The friendliness and hospitality shown us was marvellous. After the Conference, George and Sharon Samis (Brotherhood of Man Library) took us in hand and organized us to set up an Australian branch of the Library. These people are doing an incredible amount of voluntary unpaid work and shortly will be sending us on computer disks, all the material presently in the U.S, branch of the Library.

It would be helpful to know about any 6-0-6 readers who have personal computers and modems. Software for a Bulletin Board is being provided to us so that individuals and study groups can swap greetings and messages, as well as to receive and contribute material to and from the Library. The 6-0.6 Newsletter is, of course, already included in the Library, and 6-0-6 will have a list of, and access to, all Library material. Please note that although the Commodore 64 is the recommended P.C., most other P.C.'s are successfully accessing the Library in the U.S.

George and Sharon eventually sent us on our way, after persuading me to buy a new disk drive for library use, and put us in a hire car arranged by Lee Rector, then we drove across Tennessee and North Carolina to stay with Phil and Jane Rolnick who are known to quite a few 6-0-6 readers as they were once teaching in Australia. Phil is presently a Ph.D. student in Theology at the fabulous Duke University, and, happily, Phil and I are attempting to combine our respective talents to do some writing together.

All in all we had a wonderful 2 weeks in the U.S.A. with fellow Urantians, and maybe will be going back in November to get some coaching from George Samis, Richard Preiss, and Tim Young on computerology and librarianship.

## Computer Analysis Of Dates In _The Urantia Book_

In 1572 a former professor of law from Bologna named Ugo Buoncompagni became Pope Gregory XIII; ten years later the Gregorian calendar was introduced. The Julian calendar, founded sixteen centuries earlier by Julius Caesar, was inaccurate and the need for reform was widely recognized. Its principal failure was the discrepancy between the mean length of its year, 365.25 days, and the tropical year, then averaging 365.24232 days. This is nearly eleven minutes and four seconds shorter than the Julian year. This small discrepancy had continued to accumulate until it was no longer a matter of minutes but days. By the time of the Gregorian reform, this error had grown to eleven days. Understandably, this was of concern to the Pope; if the calendar had continued unchanged, Easter would eventually have been celebrated in the summer.

The attempts at reform set off a wide range of debates, both academic and religious. At one point excommunication was threatened by the Pope against anyone who refused to accept the new calendar. The details and controversies created by the reform are presented beautifully in an article in the May 1982 issue of Scientific American by Gordon Moyer entitled “The Gregorian Calendar”.

## The Dutch Connection

For the first time in The Netherlands, URANTIA Book readers came together to share their experiences. The organizing committee of The Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ of Amsterdam selected the world famous centre for meditation, De Kosmos, for their commencing presentation. They all looked forward to the day after much intensive preparations. After words of welcome from Philip, the participants moved to the Zenzolder (Zen loft) to join in a group meditation guided by Gerhild. In silence, the group journeyed over our blue planet which was enlightened by a star, our sun, combined with the warmth we wish to share with all our brothers and sisters on Urantia.

The next part of the program took place in the blue room which was decorated with a collection of beautiful spiritual paintings by Gerhild. Jessy's speech was very inspiring. She explained how _The URANTIA Book_ was received by The Forum of seventy people in Chicago and about Dr. Sadler who was the facilitator of this group. Her interpretations of Jesus' miracles in the Bible, and how The URANTIA Papers brought the sought after clarity, were very inspiring.

More people entered the room during the break, and we had lunch with cherry pie and coffee — thanks to John Grit. Many of us met for the first time and several interesting exchanges were going on.

After the break, Claire talked about the attainment of the highest spiritual freedom with which one is confronted while reading the book.

Then we joined Liesbeth and Philip in the Zenzolder, and they adjusted the spiritual tunes, 'Melody has power a whole world to transform" (500:6)

### Understanding Study Group Values

When Henry began his speech, the room was almost full of people. He explained that study groups contribute to a better understanding of the book. “If the same spiritual intentions are present within the group, the results are a multiplication of these intentions.”

Mrs. Woelderen explained in her talk the reasons for the many repetitions in The URANIIA Book. “Look at a diamond, where every facet represents the whole story.”

Jean Claude continued with a talk, 'Study of _The URANTIA Book_', followed by a question and answer session.

The day was completed with a sacred dance guided by Kitty, and we enjoyed this very much. During the entire day spiritual waves were surrounding us, and truth beauty and goodness touched all of us.

> “Melody of thought — the thinking of spiritual thoughts can be so perfected as to burst forth in the melodies of Havona.” (<a id="a123_125"></a>[UB 44:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p1_8))

### Desire for Increased Fruitfulness

Afterword: The spin-off effects of this day can still be felt. We were blessed with an increase in readership in Holland. Even those of us who had reservations about this project are now admitting the event was a fruitful one. Communications among us have improved, although there is much more work to do.

The need for a communications network in Europe, preferably with personal contacts, is quite clear. The mere exchange of newsprints alone is not effective for this purpose. It seems that the information we get from the Urantia Brotherhood does not address this need.

Our groups in The Netherlands would like to hear from you. Make your suggestions, comments or ideas to:

### Translation In The Making

The exciting new is that over two thirds of _The URANTIA Book_ has been translated into Dutch by a small group of translators for study group purposes (Like the Finnish translation). This makes the Book accessible to so many more people.

## News From The Ascenders' Trail

Gerard Touchet from Canada, a scholar and religionist shares insights derived from a lifetime of experience and study. As a young man he was a missionary in India. In 1971 he discovered _The URANTIA Book_ and as a student of the Papers has continued his quest for insight and knowledge. Today he has the motivation to share his search for God as our Father in service to all of us ... Mankind as his brothers,

Gerard has provided about 20 messages, most of which are titled: 'News Fran Ascenders' Trail".

George Sammis of the Brotherhood of Man Library has kindly donated these lectures on audio tape to the study groups of Australia.

## London International Book Fair

There has been an event which might eventually prove very important for the spread of the URANTIA teachings in Britain. For the first time in this country, _The URANTIA Book_ has been exhibited on a stand at a Book Fair. The London International Book Fair, the largest of its kind in this country, was held at Olympia in London from 28th to 30th March, and on the previous weekend we had the pleasure of meeting John Hales, Resident Director, Urantia Brotherhood, and his wife; Dave Elders; and Scott Forsythe and his wife, at the home of Gez and Pamela Lamb in Harrow. We all had a very pleasant and useful visit with then, and a rare opportunity to hear at first hand about the work of what is, after all, the centre of URANTIA Book activity on the planet. One aim of our American guests' visit to the Fair was to try and find a suitable distributor for our Book through contacts made at the Fair, and as a result of these contacts, a British distributor might soon be appointed.

Up to now of course, those few bookshops that have carried _The URANTIA Book_ have had to order single copies or small batches directly from Chicago or from American distributors. We can hope that if there is a British distributor, British bookshops will be less reluctant to stock the Book and thus it will become better known.

Joining our American guests for the Book Fair was Jacques Dupont, who has done so much for the spread of the URANTIA teachings in France. As most readers will be aware, the Centre of Study and Reflection in Human Destiny (C.E.R.D.H.) with which Jacques is associated, issues a regular newsletter, “The Letter”, in English and French editions. Jacques suggested establishing a British distribution for “The Letter”, and I for one an all in favour of exchanging views and experiences with readers in other countries through this medium. Barbara Moore has kindly agreed to undertake distribution of “The Letter” in Britain.

The summer weekend gathering of URANTIA Book readers in London which has become an annual tradition, will this year be held on 6th and 7th August, and not the previous weekend as originally planned. The venue will be, as in previous years, the Lambs' home at 21 Westmorland Road, North Harrow (01-427-3593), and Henry Begemann will once again be coming over from Holland to join our gathering.

Dear 6-0-6

I am a han radio operator and have several reader friends with whom I chat on a weekly basis via shortwave. It has been a desire of mine for some time to have an international study group by radio. Do you know of any ham readers 'down under' or would you be interested in publishing a call? I would be most interested hearing from any hams via post to set up a schedule. My call sign is N6KOB.

To Helen Hutchinson

I quite agree that God could never lie to us, but there is no claim in _The URANTIA Book_ that matters of science and history in the Book are all factually correct, in fact it is stated that the authors of the papers were not permitted to reveal that which was in advance of current knowledge at the time of receipt of the papers. It is also doubtful whether some authors, for example midwayers, have knowledge that is much in advance of what is now known to conventional earthlings. I see it as a supreme act of love on the part of my Father-God that I am permitted to doubt, and thus be truly a free-will personality. I also agree that scientists are far more likely to be wrong than our precious URANTIA Book, but hold that possible errors in the Book have no bearing on the veracity of its claim to be the revelation I know it to be.

Where there is discord, I may bring harmony, Where there is doubt, I may bring faith. Where there is despair, I may bring joy. For it is by forgetting self that one is found; it is by forgiving that one is forgiven; it is by dying that one awakens to eternal life.”

> You and I must come forward and share the joy of loving. But we cannot give what we don't have. That's why we need to pray. And prayer will give us a clean heart, And a clean heart will see the God in each other. And if we see God in each other, we will be able to live in peace. And if we live in peace, we will be able to share the joy of loving with each other and God will be with us. God Bless You.
