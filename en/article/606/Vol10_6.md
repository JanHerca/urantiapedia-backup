## A Note From Your Editor

With this last issue for 1989 I'd like to say a warm and heartfelt 'thank you' for all your continued support. I do treasure your encouraging little notes of appreciation. At the last conference I announced that I will hand back the editorship of 6-0-6 to Neil Francey in the middle of next year. Neil, who after the welcome break from this responsibility, is all geared up and ready to go with, undoubtedly, some fresh ideas for our beloved newsletter. He will receive some assistance from Ken Glasziou in putting it all together.

The address of 6-0-6 will remain the same as I will continue to look after the mailing and subscriptions.

I want to wish you all a safe and joyous holiday season and look forward to hearing from you again in the nineties, when we will celebrate our 10th anniversary!

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “It should not be the aim of kingdom believers literally to imitate the outward life of Jesus in the flesh but rather to share his faith; to trust God as he trusted God and to believe in men as he believed in men. Jesus never argued about either the fatherhood of God or the brotherhood of men; he was a living illustration of the one and a profound demonstration of the other.” _The URANTIA Book_ <a id="a79_400"></a>[UB 196:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_5)

## Readers' Get-Together in the West

As some readers would know we held a get-together over here in W.A. on the weekend of the 19th — 20th August. The venue was Fairbridge Village, a one hour drive south of Perth.

All told 11 people attended, 5 arriving on the Friday evening, the rest intermittently on the Saturday.

Will, Pete and myself arrived a little late and were greeted by Margaret and Pam, frantically trying to get the fire started. Will, being the old bushie that he is, sorted that out. With fire blazing and no time to waste it was straight into a study group session. The Paper on Personality Survival was chosen, which led to some interesting conversation as Pam and Margaret were devout reincarnationists. We continued on that theme the next day.

## Towards Specialization

There seems to be a propensity in the latter half of the 20th century towards specialization — of seeing reality in our own particular sphere of endeavour. Each decade has its catch phrase. The eighties seems to be one of economical and material considerations, generally speaking of course.

The anarchy and personal experience of the sixties led a lot of us into the lull of the seventies. The plight of the nineties and into the next century may well hinge on the economic security and the freedom to act.

The scientific and technological age is no respector of persons. Each of the five epochal revelations has heralded an event of world significance. Our present age and the Urantia revelation are indeed of monumental importance. It will only be in retrospect that its full impact will be realised.

## Report On Noosa '89

The timing, weatherwise, was perfect — although the local community were hoping for well-overdue rain — but for us, attendees of the conference, the Sunshine Coast turned on its namesake.

The venue, Halse Lodge, a beautiful old heritage-protected Queenslander, is set only a few minutes walk from the beach, pub, shops and rainforest walks. The atmosphere was relaxed and homely. We were blessed with the Conference Room at Halse Lodge being available for our sole usage for the duration of our stay. The adjoining kitchen area enabled us to have beverages as we desired, which increased the homely effect.

Despite interstate travelling problems associated with the Air Strike, we had 31 attendees who started arriving from 12 o'clock onwards on Thursday 5th October.

## International. Encounter In France

The second International meeting organized by the C.E.R.D.H. in France, took place at Montvillargenne from July 30 to August 6 .

About sixty readers came from twelve different countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, Switzerland, U.S.A and France.

The theme of this meeting was “Service”. The participants were divided into groups of 8 or less, including an interpreter, and we thought about what progress a reader can bring in such fields as religion, education, and politics, when he/she has become imbued with the teachings of the 5th Revelation.

During free time, top-quality entertainments were provided by the groups themselves.

It was a time of unforgettable human contacts and no doubt our minds will often be united on the same thought channels in the months to come.

A spiritual fraternity network has been created. Let us keep it alive by visiting or telephoning one another, and may the true friendship that binds us attract members from our respective circles.

From: C.E.R.D.H. Letter No 21, August 1989.

## In His Arms

In His arms — like a child — His child
There is no fear.
His love flows through, — healing, nourishing, spreading. 
Flows through to others, to heal and nourish them.
No hurry, no rush,
I'm already there — In His arms — like a child — His Child.

My brothers and sisters live in fear.
There's no need to.
They too are in His arms — like a child — His child
They want his peace — but it's too simple to grasp.
In time they will see
They're already there — In His arms — like a child 
HIS CHILD


Robyn Hromek, Mullumbimbi, NSW.

## German Translation?

A private German translation has commenced. Urs Ruchti from Switzerland and our own Jo Hausler from Eumundi, QLD. would like to hear from other interested readers who would enjoy to take part in this important task.

Please contact either:

Urs Ruchti, Ottenhoffenstr: 67, CH — 8738 UETLIBURG, Switzerland

or

Jo Hausler, Solar Rd, Eumundi, QLD. 4562

_Editors Note_: After I talked to Jo Hausler at NOOSA '89, I wrote a letter to Olga Unverzagt, a. German lady in Floridas USA whom I met many years ago when she visited Australia. O1ga is in the process of moving back to Germany and when she heard about the German translation, she wrote back straight away.

I would like to share some excerpts from her letter : ....“What interesting news you are giving me concerning the German translation. I can tell you that this translation has always been very much at my heart. After my retirement I started on some Papers from “The Life of Jesus”, but did not stick with it. Life was going on and it is a time-consuming and not easy task., although I thought the Jesus Papers would be easier. But then I must confess, I am very conscientious and want it to be absolutely correct

Well, several years later I was approached by Asana Du whom I had met at one of the conferences, and he had written to about 7 Germans to start a team for the German translation, but only Eva Van Sant (nee Sepp) and I responded. So Eva and I went ahead; I did the original translation, which I sent to her for checking out and corrections and that went back and forth. At one conference in Oklahoma, where Eva lives, I stayed with her for several days and we worked on a Paper together, which was, of course so much easier than having to write back and forth. Eva is probably even more fussy about getting it right.

Anyway, after a while we stopped the work, since we did not get the support of the URANTIA Foundation. (I always thought, they would be happy if someone wanted to do it no charge). Since we are giving our lifetime for such a responsible job, Eva especially decided not to translate anymore; besides she has a job and a not-too-well husband. The Foundation allowed us to translate for our own sake, but not to give out the translated parts to anyone. But we do not need to give our time to translate just for fun! I speak German still fluently!

And imagine, I had met Nicole and Urs Ruchti at a conference in Oklahoma, but don't remember that Urs was serious about working on the translation himself. Now I know something is going on, I have to approach Asana Duex, now in California, again; he never let me know any more about it as he had promised at one time.

I am thrilled to hear there are a few more Germans in Australia, it requires a team to translate the book. When I return to Germany I will be very busy for a while, but the German translation is of paramount importance and it would be wonderful, if this serious work would now be continued. I definitely will contact the Ruchtis. Maybe a trip to Switzerland (I. have a niece there in Basel and one of her married brothers lives in Zurich) sometime next year could be made. What you wrote me about the Gernan translation sounds really exciting!".....

As readers are undoubtedly aware, the URAVTIA Foundation has the task to protect the copyright of _The URANTIA Book_ and to avoid disappointment it would seem wise to first communicate with them before starting on any translation.

## News From Pennsylvania

A while ago I received a letter from George Zuberbuehler asking me for some information on how to run a newsletter as his study group: was contemplating on starting one. I supplied him with some helpful hints and he replied with the following letter which I would like to share as I'm sure more readers would be interested in our family in Pennsylvania.

Dear Madeline,

Thank you for sharing your experience with the 6-0-6 and the benefits of providing a forum for URANTIA Book students. Some of this information will be useful for us as we develop our plans for sharing the fruits of our study group activity.

In becoming a member of the Brotherhood of Man Library last month, I was happy to discover that the 1986 and 1987 issues of Six-0-Six have been made available through this excellent service of George Sarmis and staff. I trust that the 1988 and subsequent issues will also become available to us in the future.

In order to keep our costs down and to increase readership, it is likely that our future publication will be made available exclusively through the BOML, which happily serves Australia through its facility in Queensland.

Our study group formed in 1985 and during the past four years it has grown from three to about ten regular members. We meet every Wednesday evening, with half of our group having to travel forty to eighty miles each way (several come from Delaware and one from New Jersey). As you can imagine, it takes some dedication for our family to come together once a week, so it is not very often that we have all ten members present at one time.

In February our group began the long-term commitment of reading _The URANTIA Book_ from the first Paper to the last, at a rate of two Papers each month. During this time I have taken about 200 pages of meeting notes. It is thought that some of the comments and discussions that come out of our study may one day form the nucleus of our publication/sharing program. This idea has not been fully decided upon, however, and there is a strong possibility that our newly inaugurated public-speaking effort will provide quite a storehouse of informative material worthy of sharing with others. As you can see, while the final stages of our product await development in the months ahead, there is much in the way of potential and challenge to service.

This public-speaking adventure is presently self-contained. Each week one of the group delivers a prepared five-minute talk on the subject of his or her choosing. This experience receives the additional benefit of a short critique based on the principle of Toastmasters International. It has already become very clear that this approach greatly magnifies our appreciation and understanding of various facets of our wonderful Revelation and it also enhances our ability to share these truths with others.

Once we have begun receiving your Newsletter through the BOML, I foresee many opportunities for our developing a fuller relationship by mail: two study groups sharing truth and love based upon our gift, _The URANTIA Book_."

George Zuberbuehler, White Haven, PA. USA

## History Of Urantia Family In Australia

Ann Bendall has decided to prepare a history of the URANTIA movement in Australia which Ken Glasziou will keep on the Brotherhood of Man Library at Maleny. Could anyone who found the Book before 1980 be able to help her with this project by writing down their recollections of how and when they obtained the Book and the contacts they had in those early days.

Write to: Ann Bendal1, P.0. Box 839, Nambour, QLD. 4560.

## Special 10th Anniversary Edition Of Six-0-Six

In February 1990 Six-0-Six Newsletter will be celebrating its 10th anniversary. Through a team effort of our former editor Neil Francey, Ken Glasziou and your present editor we are trying to put a special issue together with the best reading from ten years of 6-0-6.

We expect this issue to be about $20-24$ pages giving you a readers digest version of those ten years.

You will read about the study groups, the conferences, the library donation scheme, the overseas visitors, some of the best stories and cartoons.

This is meant to be a fund raiser for a new photo copier we desperately need. Price $15 for Australia, $15 US for overseas. Please order your copy now so we have some indication about how many we need.

We will include a reply slip for your convenience.

## Did You Know?

That Six-0-Six is being read in the following countries: USA, Canada, France, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti, Switzerland, The Netherlands, U.K., Hong Kong, Estonia, Finland and of course in the land of OZ !

That our overseas readership is growing faster than our Australian one?

## The Star Of Bethlehem Foretold In _The Urantia Book_ ?

Religion and science have long pondered the questions posed by the Star of Bethlehem. Theories abound. Supernovas comets, planetary conjunctions, and the miraculous have been invoked. Some even question if the event ever occurred, let alone how many wise men.

Of the many proposals, the planetary conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter is by far the most popular. It isn't new. Johannes Kepler, after discovering the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction in Pisces a few days before Christmas in 1603, calculated backward and discovered the 7 B.C. event. Kepler was not the first to describe this. In 1977, David H. Clark described a similar assertion in English church annals dating from A.D. 1285. In the early days of planetariums, operators abused their Zeiss projectors by running the machines high-speed backwards to 7 B.C., producing the triple conjunction. This triple conjunction means that the retrograde loops of the two planets overlap. Translated, Jupiter passes Saturn three times over a several month period. The last occurrence of this sort was in 1981.

The spiritual life, to which art belongs and of which she is one of the mightiest elements, is a complicated but definite and easily definable movement forwards and upwards. This movement is the movement of experience. It may take different forms, but it holds at bottom to the same inner thought and purpose.

Veiled in obscurity are the causes of this need to move ever upwards and forwards, by sweat of the brow, through sufferings and fears. When one stage has been accomplished, and many evil stones cleared from the road, some unseen ... hand scatters new obstacles in the way, so that the path often seems blocked and totally obliterated. But there never fails to come to the rescue some human being, like ourselves in everything except that he has in him a secret power of vision.
