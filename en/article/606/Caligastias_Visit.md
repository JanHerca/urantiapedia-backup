August 18, 1990
PCL COMMUNIQUE

Caligastia's Visit to the Planetary Center of Light

About 2:45 PM, Saturday, August 11, 1990 we noticed a profound energy change. At precisely 3 PM Caligastia's spaceship anchored directly above the PLANETARY CENTER OF LIGHT accompanied by an appropriate Light Escort. (There is a Starship anchored over this area.) The thunder and energy bursts (like lightning) were stunning. When the CONTACT between Caligastia's ship and the PCL was made everything went off... electricity stopped. There were bursts of “lightning” both outside and INSIDE the room. In a quick series of three energy bursts Caligastia was in the room. For almost four hours there was a Hierarchy meeting here which had to do with the surrender of Caligastia the purpose of which was to prevent further waste such as the bloodshed of the prime stock of Urantians lined up in the Middle East for massacre/sacrifice.

Among the various reasons that event occurred here is that the PLANETARY CENTER OF LIGHT is exactly that. In addition, my appointment as Ambassador for the Planetary Prince, Machiventa Melchizedek, has placed us in the active position of being the Embassy for the New Planetary Spiritual Government. As you know, Embassies are usually neutral ground where often even enemies or their representatives meet and Ambassadors try to solve problems diplomatically. Furthermore, since I first came to Urantia WITH Caligastia when he was appointed Planetary Prince and had a VERY long relationship with him that began with friendship and admiration, my part of the meeting was to APPEAL to him, along with others who were present, to SURRENDER NOW. He well knows he has lost and that there is little time left and we all tried to convince him that he should LEAVE NOW with at least the dignity of a Lanonandek which he still is in spite of the death and destruction he has helped perpetuate since he joined Lucifer and Satan and took Urantia into the terrible Rebellion which has ended in the heavens.

Caligastia did not make a commitment before he left the meeting so we cannot, at this time, tell you what HIS personal decision was but we do believe he has been taken into custody and removed to the Father's Prison World to wait annihilation. This change may not reflect for a while on the 3-D level for the Rebellion, obviously, still has to be settled on the human/earth plane. However, his REMOVAL will clear the way for rapid progression on the Spiritual level including for any of you who are truly working on behalf of Jesus/Michael.
