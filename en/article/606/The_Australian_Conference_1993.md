It is with great pleasure that we announce the 1993 Australian Conference for readers of _The URANTIA Book_

## The Venue

The world famous Sea World Nara Resort set in lush tropical gardens on the Queensland Gold Coast, just south of Brisbane. Only hundreds of secluded acres of bushland and sand dunes separate the resort from the sparkling waters of the Pacific Ocean.

## The Theme

WELCOME TO THE SHORES OF PARADISE.

“You may be certain of being warmly welcomed when you experience the resurrection into eternity on the everlasting shores of Paradise.” (283)

## The Purpose

During our three day sojourn at this physical paradise we can share insights on how we envisage we can spiritually grow and traverse the realms to The Central Isle of Paradise.

“The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind.” (2097)

Jesus developed superlative techniques to effect the process. He often engaged in solitary commune with the Father — to gather strength, to seek new stores of wisdom, to find better ways to subject his total personality to the consciousness of divinity contact.

In this and no doubt many other ways, Jesus resolved ordinary conflicts of living and also the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature.

We are bid to do likewise.

> “_If you sincerely nun the race of time and gain the final goal of faith, the reward of the ages shall be yours._” (<a id="a60_118"></a>[UB 112:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_1))

## The Time

The race of time will stand still from 9.00 am Saturday October 2 to noon Monday October 4, 1993.

## The Facilities

We have our own conference room and equipment. Accommodation is on a twin share basis, each room having private shower/bath and toilet, colour TV, STD/ISD telephone, room safe, refrigerator and private balconies.

## The Cost

For the two nights plus all meals from the Saturday lunch to breakfast on the Monday, the attendance fee is $190. This will include free use of pool, tennis courts, spa, sauna and bicycles. Shuttle bus service is available, as is discounted admission to Sea World. (The mini train to Sea World has a station right near our Conference Room.)

## The Program

Full program details will be included in the next issue of Six-O-Six, along with the registration form. If you wish to secure your booking in advance, please write to us here at Six-O-Six.

There will be lots of free time to enjoy other pursuits for the adventurous — parasailing, jet skiing, water skiing and bunge jumping.
