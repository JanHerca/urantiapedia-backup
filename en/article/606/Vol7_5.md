## The Remembrance Supper

> “Mind knows quantity, reality, meanings. But quality — values — is felt. That which feels is the mutual creation of mind, which knows, and the associated spirit, which reality-izes.” (<a id="a41_186"></a>[UB 111:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_6))

This quotation from _the URANTIA Book_ came to my mind the morning after the Remembrance Supper, which the Melbourne Study Groups held on Sunday 6 th April. Jesus established the Remembrance Supper on the 6th April, 30 A.D.

Neil Francey was talking about the same thing, I think, when he said: “I felt, I could almost touch the morontia level.”

## Interplanetary Conference 2086 A.D. ?

This impression was flashed to Six-0-Six via the mind circuits of a young Melbourne artist, Fil Barlow. Ever since the age of 14, Fil has been creating a universe of his own with different intelligent creatures unlike ourselves. He called this his “Zooniverse”. Fil thought his imagination had created a pretty vast cosmos, until he came across _the URANTIA Book_. After a friend had picked one up for $5 in a second hand bookshop and Fil started reading it, he felt completely outdone. The reality was even greater than his wildest dreams could have imagined. Fil has now joined the ranks of enthusiastic URANTIA Book readers in Melbourne and wonders if anyone would like to come and help him with his study of the book on the fourth Wednesday of the month. You will find Fil at:

Flat 2/ 2-6 Edlington St. Hawthorn, Tel. 8186970 Home, 2408021 Work.

## Thought for the Month

> “Organic evolution on the inhabited worlds is physically limited by the potentials of the original physical-life implantations of the Life Carriers.”
> 
> “Mortal man is a machine, a living mechanism; his roots are truly in the physical world of energy. Many human reactions are mechanical in nature; much of life is machinelike. But man, a mechanism, is much more than a machine; he is mind endowed and spirit indwelt; and though he can never throughout his material life escape the chemical and electrical mechanics of his existence, he can increasingly learn how to subordinate this physical-life machine to the directive wisdom of experience by the process of consecrating the human mind to the execution of the spiritual urges of the indwelling Thought Adjuster.” <a id="a65_616"></a>[UB 118:8.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_1)

## Commentary on Scientific Statements in The Urantia Book, Part II

**Planetary Atmospheres**

_The Urantia Book_ (<a id="a71_20"></a>[UB 49:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p2_1)) discusses varying kinds of life which inhabit planets with atmospheres different from our own. Our type of life form is called “mid-breather”, and constitutes 91% of all life types in the universe. Those which inhabit planets with high density atmospheres are termed “superbreathers”, and those inhabiting planets with low density atmospheres are termed “sub-breathers”. _The Urantia Book_ then states that if there is life on Venus it would be of the superbreather class, whilst if life existed on Mars it would be the sub-breather class. We had no knowledge of the atmospheric densities of these two planets when _the Urantia Book_ was written.

The Mariner 5 probe to Venus in 1967 sent back data on the atmosphere and later probes gave data for Mars. These measurements showed that the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 times that of the Earth, thus high density, whilst that of Mars is 1/100th that of Earth, hence low density.

NEXT MONTH: Ken will talk about Cosmology — the red shift, Continental Drift, Geology, Palaeontology, and Anthropology.

## 1986 National Conference — Melbourne June 7Th \& 8Th

It's not too late to register for the conference at the Victoria College, 336 Glenferrie Rd. Malvern.

The program for the weekend is varied and everyone will have a chance to be involved. We trust it will be a time of learning, sharing and joy.

Interstate visitors from N.S.W., W.A., and Tasmania are attending and will no doubt have lots of news. And we are delighted to announce our international visitors: Berkeley Elliot, Tom Allan and John Hales. We feel sure they will give us an exciting and vivid account of their experiences and present a unique perspective on the URANTIA movement. Try not to miss this marvellous opportunity!

## Australia — A Pagan Country?

Can you call Australia a pagan country and get away with it ? Apparently not, as I discovered when I attempted this exercise through the media recently. People were both puzzled and offended.

But why? Surely it's time that believers and unbelievers alike faced up to certain realities about the Christian religion in Australia. On the one hand, Christianity is not as insignificant or irrelevant as its optimistic enemies and pessimistic friends seem to think. On the other hand, the residual christianity of the unchurched majority is perceptibly ebbing away.

To be a Christian these days requires a definite commitment. People deliberately choose to go to church rather than merely conform to social pressure. As a result, there is far less hypocrisy about Australian Christianity, and Christians are better informed and better equipped.

## Astronomy — Solving The Riddles

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" alt="Galaxy">

</figure>

NEW YORK, AP — The Milky Way — the galaxy in which the Solar System and Earth are located — is being pulled through space at 1,500,000 kmh towards what could be a distant, immense and as yet undiscovered mass. A US-British team at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tuscon, Arizona discovered the motion by studying about 400 galaxies in a roughly spherical region 350 million light years in diameter. A large part of the univerge appears to be moving together toward the direction in the sky marked by the Southern Cross. 

The gravitational pull of an immense mass might explain the motion, but a motion of this size would appear to require a mass 50 times larger than our orm supercluster and they haven't been able to find the mass yet. A supercluster is a group of galaxies. The mass could be in the form of matter that cannot be detected with current astronomical instruments.

If they can't find the matter, then they may have to rethink theories on the expansion of the universe and the role of gravity.
