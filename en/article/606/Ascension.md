**Repersonalisation, Ascension, Fusion, Rematerialisation, Reconstruction, The Light Body and the Morontia Body are All Part of the Same Process.**

If ever there was an interesting controversy, it is the apparent denial in _The URANTIA Book_ of ‘reincarnation’. There are those who will accept this without question and there are many who question this denial due to their personal experience of becoming aware, sometimes intimately, of ‘other lives’ to the point where they feel these ‘other lives’ are their own. This assumption can be both true or false depending on the circumstances as well as semantics. Unfortunately, there are countless others who have been 'turned off to _The URANTIA Book_ because of this controversy who would have otherwise benefited greatly from this Revelation.

Keeping in mind _The URANTIA Book_ states that it is an incomplete and partial revelation, it is no wonder many ask why it did not go on to explain this attitude about reincarnation, or more accurately ‘repersonalisation’, especially since those of the Revelatory Commission are obviously intelligent enough to have known this would be unacceptable to thousands in spite of the fact that this Epochal Revelation was INTENDED to reach the multitude. For example, why doesn't it go on to say that there is no such thing as ‘reincarnation’ as you generally understand it on Urantia? That would have at least left the door open to further research and understanding of _The URANTIA Book_ by the many who, from personal experience, disagree.

Or further still, why doesn't it state that if you pursue a really in-depth study of this Revelation to the point of understanding the Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit and Her Adjutant Mind Spirits, the Seven Psychic Circles, etc., that it is possible to arrive at a **WORKABLE** understanding of how you may become conscious of ‘other lives’ which may or may not become other facets of your personality. It is possible not only to become conscious of other personalities within the mind system you are involved with, it is possible for certain evolutionary humans, through their own spirituality, to raise the frequency of their physical bodies (in varying degrees) to the point where they can dematerialize enough to allow those of a higher dimension to come in and share the vessel and **APPEAR** — **MANIFEST** — **DEMONSTRATE** to those who have begun to develop **SPIRITUAL VISION**. It is vital to understand spiritual vision which is the ability to SEE in multiple dimensions. Jesus repeatedly referred to SPIRITUAL VISION and it is often mentioned in _The URANTIA Book_:

> “_On a material world you think of a body as having a spirit, but we regard the spirit as having a body. The material eyes are truly the windows of the spirit-born soul._” (<a id="a44_175"></a>[UB 42:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_12))

> “_The lamp of the body is the eye; if, therefore, your eye is generous, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is selfish, the whole body will be filled with darkness._” (<a id="a46_189"></a>[UB 140:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_12))

> “_The material manifestations of divinity appear defective to the evolutionary mind of man only because mortal man persists in viewing the phenomena of nature through natural eyes, human vision unaided by morontia mota or by revelation, its compensatory substitute on the worlds of time._” (<a id="a48_293"></a>[UB 4:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_7))

> “_But it is not necessary to see God with the eyes of the flesh in order to discern him by the faith-vision of the spiritualized mind._” (<a id="a50_140"></a>[UB 1:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_3))

> “_With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit._” (<a id="a52_127"></a>[UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5))

> “_If you so fully conform to the Adjuster's mind that you see eye to eye, then your minds become one, and you receive the reinforcement of the Adjuster's mind._” (<a id="a54_165"></a>[UB 110:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_5))

> “_... the Adjuster is increasingly enabled to register his picturizations of destiny with augmenting vividness and conviction upon the evolving consciousness of this God-seeking mind-soul._” (<a id="a56_194"></a>[UB 110:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_5))

> “_The eye of the material mind perceives a world of factual knowledge; the eye of the spiritualized intellect discerns a world of true values. These two views, synchronized and harmonized, reveal the world of reality, wherein wisdom interprets the phenomena of the universe in terms of progressive personal experience._” (<a id="a58_324"></a>[UB 130:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_10))

> “_These realities are actually there, notwithstanding that the Adjuster is seldom able to exalt these duplicate creations sufficiently to exhibit them to the light of consciousness._” (<a id="a60_187"></a>[UB 108:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_5))

> “_And how they do enjoy communicating with their subjects in more or less direct channels! How they rejoice when they can dispense with symbols and other methods of indirection and flash their messages straight to the intellects of their human partners!_” (<a id="a62_259"></a>[UB 108:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_7))

> “_They gave him the bread to bless, and as he began to break and hand to them, their eyes were opened ..._” (<a id="a64_111"></a>[UB 190:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_5))

> “_On one occasion he intimated that, whereas the eye of flesh had beheld him when he lived here in the flesh, on his return (at least on one of his possible visits) he would be discerned only by the eye of spiritual faith._” (<a id="a66_228"></a>[UB 176:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_3))

> “_The eye of flesh beholds the Son of Man in the flesh, but only the eye of the spirit will behold the Son of Man glorified by the Father and appearing on earth in his own name._” (<a id="a68_183"></a>[UB 176:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_4))

> “_I pray that you may discern the meaning of my teaching with the eyes of the spirit._” (<a id="a70_91"></a>[UB 181:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_14))

> “_And then, when you are blessed with spiritual vision, go forth to your work, dedicating your life to the cause of leading mankind to search for God and to seek eternal realities with the eye of spiritual faith and not with the eyes of the material mind._” (<a id="a72_261"></a>[UB 181:2.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_20))

(Other relative quotations from _The URANTIA Book_: <a id="a74_52"></a>[UB 29:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_11), <a id="a74_97"></a>[UB 76:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_8), <a id="a74_140"></a>[UB 132:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_3), <a id="a74_185"></a>[UB 142:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_3), <a id="a74_230"></a>[UB 167:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p7_4), <a id="a74_275"></a>[UB 181:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_12), <a id="a74_322"></a>[UB 189:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p4_11), <a id="a74_369"></a>[UB 191:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p3_3), etc.)

This also applies to the physical depending on the ‘mission/assignment’ of the individual and their level of spiritual attainment. For example, when Lao-tze wishes to use this vehicle I am presently incarnated in (using), I raise the frequency of this vessel to the point of mutual compatibility and Lao-tze may visibly manifest through my *LIGHT BODY* which is the same as the **MORONTIA BODY**. When this occurs, Lao-tze and I become ONE as I am enjoying the reinforcement of Lao-tze's **MIND**, **LIGHT BODY AND PERSONALITY**. He is repersonalising through me. I am the material complement of a spirit personality (Lao-tze and others) entrusted with the enactment of some cosmic achievement essential to the spiritual economy of the planet. (See <a id="a78_749"></a>[2. SELF-ACTING ADJUSTERS](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_7))

One deep thinking person, Carol Davidson of Suitland, Maryland, USA, wrote an interesting perspective in her article “A Reincarnation Explanation” reprinted from THE CIRCLES, Winter 1990 in the last Six-O-Six when she speaks of the “mind intellect systems”. This is PART of the explanation but as previously mentioned there are many things one must be aware of to obtain a full understanding of this so-called “reincarnation” phenomenon including PERSONAL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE. One such thing which must be understood, and of course accepted, is the reality of the LIGHT BODY — THE MORONTIA BODY.

You are about to see manifest on this planet demonstrations by many repersonalised ascenders. Some of them, the most highly evolved beings in this Universe, are presently REPERSONALISED on Urantia. You will witness MANIFESTATIONS and DEMONSTRATIONS of Repersonalised Ascenders (from the sixth and seventh mansion worlds) which will mean increased mental communications due to the breaking through into higher frequency vibrations. You are NOW in the period which will herald the actual **physical** ruler of your planet, Machiventa Melchizedek, Prince of Urantia.

> You are NOW in the period which will herald the actual **physical** ruler of your planet, Machiventa Melchizedek, Prince of Urantia.

The LIGHT BODY is the astral genetic coding of the Christ Body. If you continue to believe the form of the end result is not the action of the spirit within that form, then you are only deceiving yourself and one another and do not bring about the orderly, pleasant, peaceful, loving progression of that evolutionary change which you call matter, flesh in the body. I ask of you to express flesh matter and to show its transmutability. Have I not, in THIS ministry cycle publicly, and to many of you personally, shown to you the transmutability of fleshly form which is spirit? Have I not given you the teachings? Not I alone and not of myself, but Spirit through me in the LIGHT BODY form and in that period simply and fully for YOUR transmutation from the flesh into the true spiritual or fourth dimensional vehicle that is rapidly transforming your earth planet at this time? The fourth and fifth dimensional ‘body’ is different from the three dimensional ‘flesh’ body only in that it expresses outwardly in a different vibration or collection of atomic energy and through meditation, sincere prayer and **accepting the reality** of these dimensional changes will YOU be able to express what is known as the LIGHT or MORONTIA BODY OF THE I AM PRESENCE. It is for **YOU**... the next higher step in evolution. Most Urantians will literally be dying to do what only a few are doing NOW which is **transfiguring** the 3-D flesh body into the next higher dimension along with the transfiguration of Urantia itself. If you do **not do this you will have to go through the process of living called death and be transferred out of here to the Resurrection Halls of Mansonia No 1. I am pleased to say that just over the past few months more and more are becoming aware they too are ASCENDING NOW. What are the rest of you waiting for? There isn't much time left and nobody is going to do it for you!**

So be alert and be prepared for you are in the days of MANIFESTATION when those who are truly of the Christ Light Workers shall bring forth the LIGHT BODY along with the **flesh** form and **demonstrate** to all mankind as it was demonstrated to over 1,000 in those days of Galilee by Jesus Christ, the Son of the FatherMother Creator God who is in each and everyone of us. Your goal should be to demonstrate the Light Body by BYPASSING the process of living called death. But there is an overlapping, there is an aligning, there is often a simultaneous functioning of more than one body and more than one level of consciousness in order to bring forth the total fourth dimensional or Christ-like Spiritual Body in this area of concern. You are not going to be given any instantaneous rod of lightning in the form of a miraculous changeover. You are going to have to **demonstrate** and to develop the **DISCIPLINE** in creating a force field through your individualized personality and problems in which the fourth dimensional or Christ-like Self (with a capital ‘ S ’) can broadcast its purpose in life so the two become ONE and are ‘married in one house’ which is the body vehicle or personality self which we recognize.

You have not fully realized yet, many of you, that the Light Body is conducted by the Spiritual Self independently of the physical vessel. You may not know as yet that these Light Bodies may be projected into the earth plane or into the atmosphere and/or on board appropriate spaceships at any given time and place when the **Spiritual Self** within feels a true mission and message proper and forthcoming. So what you do not know and realize totally, is that your Light Body is a **plus extension** to that of your physical vehicle. Your endeavours to project the Light Bodies in other places, besides the place where your own physical frequency is operating, are to permit this travel to become widely accepted upon Urantia in these times of the latter days and the end time of material matter or third dimensional frequency upon the earth. In this we have assisted you on numerous occasions both consciously and unconsciously. Most often this has occurred in the sleep or dream state when you have not been aware of the actual projection and production that resulted from it because those who will produce this effect consciously must have practised it sufficiently within the unconscious state, to make it appear to them as a simple and unconcerning matter. You have been told that the Light Bodies are formed in and around your physical bodies but most of you do not understand how you may bring about the greater alignment between these two, the physical and the spiritual, in order that you may enhance the Light Body **manifestation** and the physical reference point which is your own consciousness on earth. The I AM consciousness is in effect wherever men or women will give it that place of honour in their experience and in their lives. This spiritual know-how and realization then becomes an actual fact of existence. That form develops from these thoughts and desires and dedications and builds up in and around the focal point, a pivotal function through the conscious and physical. Light Bodies are **manifesting** and **working** in the purest Light and in the most outward manifestation of that Light collectively and independently as well. **I wish you to see the image of this thought** because it is by the imaging of your own power and force that you funnel this Light and bring it into eternal **manifestation** for the planet and all life form upon it. In working as an earthling through an earth body, it is as though you use the physical body and consciousness as a stick around which you pivot all the etheric substance and energy of your higher consciousness and goals until they wind in and around that form, and the higher form is **taking precedence** over the lower form. It is not a matter of using one body or the other body. It is more a matter of using both as long as a third dimensional earth plane is in effect, even though this has become more difficult for those in the Light. This shall continue for some time until the complete evolution can be transferred.

> The function from the higher realms is to coordinate all souls with their spiritual bodies and manifested light and then as it progresses to bring about these accelerated changes in their Morontia bodies and in their earth plane functions, so the higher self can be made manifest through the earth plane dimension.

There are two types of contact, as you may already know. One is that the individual has purified and sustained himself to such a degree that another of another plane or planet, in the etheric body and manifested Light Form can use that pivotal point. Also there are some who are so clear and developing the higher consciousness to such an infinitesimal point that they can take the physical body and evolve its vibration constantly to the extreme with their own Light Body so that the form, the Christ Self identity, is manifest through the pivotal point of the physical vehicle ... YOU! This then shall be the demonstration! The Higher Intelligences are participating in this particular work and function of raising the planetary frequencies as well as the frequencies of each individual providing they are cooperating by trying to do the Will of the Father and who are **consciously** working on their own ASCENSION. You will then have the Light Body taking more shape and more form and then impregnating the physical three dimensional form and dissolving the three dimensional form gradually while simultaneously your Light Body is closing in and around your three dimensional form until it is **totally absorbed**. You will then be able to accomplish your mission and **BYPASS THE DEATH PROCESS**. At first the manifestation will be of two forms, the three dimensional physical, which will not seem to be greatly graduated and the Light Form which will be seemingly of another substance besides Urantia plane elements. The two will gradually merge and will become ONE as demonstrated in the resurrection form. The Light Body created from the thought forms of the Spiritual Consciousness becomes predominant and overshadows completely the three dimensional physical form of the individual. Thus, the individual is then inspired by his own overself and **communes** with the forces who can work THROUGH the Light Body of his individuality of spirit. It then transmutes much of the mortal thinking, mortal desires and eventually the three dimensional physical vehicle itself. But these changes are imperceptible, except to those who are in tune with the Spirit Force that is in operation ... those who have the SPIRITUAL EYES TO SEE.

Because of this change in the body's frequency, you will be allowed to know many of the new things in consciousness that you have not necessarily been prepared to face or experience until this particular present and appropriate time. The time is **very short** for the synchronization of one level of consciousness with the higher level of consciousness. In order to allow this to be done there are many who must come and accelerate it in advance of the changeover that is **immediately beforehand** for not only Urantia but the entire system. The function from the higher realms is to coordinate all souls with their spiritual bodies and manifested light and then as it progresses to bring about these accelerated changes in their Morontia bodies and in their earth plane functions, so the higher self can be made manifest through the earth plane dimension. This has to be done in advance to prepare for the return to this planet of Jesus of Nazareth, the Creator of your Universe of Nebadon. This acceleration of the physical bodies is to permit the higher bodies and forces of other planes to work THROUGH YOUR PARTICULAR FREQUENCY VESSEL. This would be a MATERIAL COMPLEMENT or HUMAN AGENT which is a **special** type of “channel”. This is an absolute necessity! This must be accelerated from this moment forward as there are many forces who come from different places in the System and beyond who need vehicles (YOURS) through which they can do their work. That is, they need borrowed vessels in order to project into the earth plane those matters of instigating energy patterns to cause the frequency changeover and to accelerate the body vehicles of all men upon Earth. We need **PRIMARY CHANNELS** who will give themselves to this program and up to this point, there have been **VERY FEW**. You must allow this opportunity for the Hierarchy to do their work THROUGH YOU, AS YOU. It requires specialists of other areas in the System and even those from beyond to come in and operate through the body of man who is here at this time. If you are receptive and acknowledging this need for changeover they can and they will operate through you in this particular manner. **YOUR LIGHT BODIES BECOME THEIR BROADCASTING UNITS OFLIGHT FOR THE HIGHEST PURPOSES THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED.**

> You Must Allow This Opportunity For The Hierarchy To Do Their Work THROUGH YOU, AS YOU.

We can prophesy here and correctly project into man's consciousness the fact that you will have dramatic, upsetting and revolutionary schisms occur due to the tremendous impacts of these larger portions of the Hierarchy's purpose and projectiles to your system of operation at this time. This in part gives you some explanation of why we have been warning you and have been explaining to you the IMMEDIATE CYCLE OF GREAT UPHEAVAL. Not only will these upheavals be dramatic emotionally, but they WILL HAVE TO BE PHYSICAL. Unless you are receptive and accept the change, you will not be able to go through it with agreeableness (if at all) and will have much discomfort in both body and mind as a result. In some cases it will cause a desertion of the soul from the body. This is called death! In other words, the soul would not be able to retain itself within the body under such circumstances of discomfort and unpleasantness. But in the case where you will be acceptable and agreeable to the changes which you shall feel in the immediate future or are feeling now, and begin to clarify your mind and your body towards these higher truths and understandings regardless of the effects you see around you and the disturbances that shall be everywhere upon the earth, then shall you note the different frequency change in your own body and in your own mind. These symptoms will be very clear to you as you feel them start to occur. As you note them, they will cause changes in habits of long standing and will bring about new measures and ideas to you ... almost instantaneously in a few cases. You will notice that the body no longer functions as it once did but has to function on an entirely different measure and beat ... if we use the terms of rhythm to the universal cycles and the universal upliftment and ways of expressing.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ‘CHANNEL’ OF MERELY COMMUNICATIONS AND TEACHING AND WHERE A REPERSONALISED ASCENDER'S CONSCIOUSNESS TOTALLY OVERSHADOWS THE ‘CHANNEL’ AND CLAIMS THE VEHICLE FOR CERTAIN **DEMONSTRATIONS, FUNCTIONS AND MANIFESTATIONS** IS GREAT. And by MANIFESTATIONS I mean the Repersonalised Ascender **VISIBLY APPEARS** through the HUMAN AGENT — even to the point where the HUMAN AGENT **DISAPPEARS**. The individual, or HUMAN AGENT, does bring about the same fruits and purposes that the higher Repersonalised Ascender would wish to accomplish could he or she have a body vehicle in the earth plane dimensions and so express that particular part of the overall purpose and form.

So you have these examples to guide you as to WHO is WHO and as to what is what in discerning and determining what areas are being opened in the latter days as you go into a fourth, from a third, dimensional frequency form. **DEMONSTRATION** is the key. MANIFESTATION OF THE PROMISES OF SPIRIT is the key. This MUST be your equalizing and set example by which you determine **WHO** is bringing forth the light information and uplifting this planet and the transforming of these latter days. I ask you then to re-examine the works and to taste of the fruits. By their fruits then you will know WHO are the Christed Beings — those working through and **IN THE CHRISTED FORM** ... **THE LIGHT BODY**. The Repersonalised Ascenders of this planet and of this entire system and beyond who have **returned** and who are **returning** — REPERSONALISING — in these latter days to Urantia **through channels** are to perform and to show and to give concrete examples unto mankind. Those who are ready and who have passed those steps or initiations will comprehend this — what it is to have an Repersonalised Ascender overshadow and RE-DESCEND into the earth plane matter. A REPERSONALISED ASCENDER, THEREFORE, USES THE BODY OF A DISCIPLE OR A **MATERIAL COMPLEMENT (HUMAN AGENT) WHO IS CONNECTED WITH HIS VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND PURPOSES**. HOWEVER, A REPERSONALISED ASCENDER CAN INDEPENDENTLY APPEAR UPON THE EARTH. WHEN THE LIGHT BODY IS DEMONSTRATING, YOU WILL SEE THESE SO CALLED PHENOMENON ON THE EARTH PLANE. As this is done the LIGHT BODY then so completely overshadows the physical form that it **ABSORBS THE PHYSICAL FORM AND THE PHYSICAL FORM AND THE LIGHT BODY BECOME ONE**. In this process it is possible to become one with a Repersonalised Ascender who has functioned with/through you and you may, therefore, become a FACET of each others personality.
