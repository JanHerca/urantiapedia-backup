## Cultural Diversity And Spiritual Unity

### Introduction Talk

by Kathleen Swadling

Although Australia is hosting this meeting, it is our intention that emphasis is placed on interaction. For this reason we decided on the theme “Cultural Diversity \& Spiritual Unity”. For many years now the URANTIA revelation has seen a great deal of activity in the United States for obvious reasons — the revelation was placed on this world in Chicago — a major centre of trade \& commerce. The readership spread from that centre throughout America and in recent times we have seen it spreading further from that country to the very countries all of us here today have come from. The time is coming (or perhaps has come) for the readers of the world to unite in their efforts to spread this 5th Epochal Revelation and to get the invisible brotherhood of Jesus off the ground so that his superb teachings will rule in the hearts of all mankind.

## How Many Mortals Survive

The topic that I am about to present I've called 'How Many Mortals Survive". Before proceeding into my presentation, I'd like to say that I have come to no fixed conclusions on this topic, though I must admit that after researching I an now reading certain sections of _The URANTIA Book_ in a different light. Also I'd like to stress that throughout this topic we should keep in the back of our minds that :

1. Free will is involved.
2. That the mystery and love and mercy of the Father of all souls prevails.
3. That the basis of my topic is founded on things that are not fully revealed.
4. That we don't fully understand the possible shifts and differences of time from our world to the Mansion worlds and beyond.

The passages that I quote from _The URANTIA Book_, we should treat as facts but knowing that these facts are arranged in a way that support this topic. Some of the facts are partial and therefore the picture is fully open to conjecture. Also there may very well be other facts concealed within the book, that I and others have possibly overlooked, that could render the presentation invalid. But even so, if this presentation succeeds to stimulate thought and further deeper study of The URAVIIIA Book, then I feel that it has served its purpose. So with this in mind I will get on with it.

## Request For Prayer

Please join me in urgent prayer for the trustees of the URANTIA Foundation; for their health and wholeness, strength and clarity.

May their work reflect the Father's way. Let their association be of light and grace. May they be filled with His Love.

Let the scars and wounds of past fends and conflicts be healed. Let our movement be united in spirit although diverse in style. Let all the world know us by our love.

Martin Greenhut

A song is not a song until you sing it 
Love was not put in your heart to stay 
Love is not love until you give it away

## News From New Zealand

I will just write down a few lines for your newsletter and hope that I can express something of the sense of satisfaction we New Zealanders experienced at the conference, the better now, for having participated, and the ongoing harvest of feelings of association which have matured, not only with Australians, but with other nationalities who were present at the conference.

All of the New Zealanders who attended the South Pacific Mceting agreed that it was a success. We appreciated the relaxed approach in the time table which allowed for such adjustments as inevitably resulted from rescheduling so many activities over four days. It is to be hoped that we New Zealanders can match such an effort in the future, should we host such a broadly based South Pacific conference. True to its theme, we certainly had a unity in cultural diversity.

The Auckland study group had its third weekly meeting since the conference in November. The first week was informal in style owing to so many of our members being absent for different reasons. We were able to have a good post-conference chat. The second week our group got down to study after some earlier mulling over photographs taken at the conference, which indeed still does not fail to generate for us, hours of post study reversion by way of conversation. As we settle down to our routine we are increasingly being reminded of our duties here in New Zealand and are becoming aware, as a result of the conference, of those things which make up our concern. Post-conference ‘Highs’ have their place, but already things are moving, changes are taking place, there is work to be done.

The Auckland study group has just received a consignment of URAVTIA Books which were pre-ordered from the Asoka Foundation Inc, Oklahoma. We keep a stock of books, Iike most groups, which we use for a variety of purposes: library placement, new reading group developments, loan or private use, etc.

We have just recently heard of a new and encouraging development in the Hamilton region of New Zealand. Hamilton is a moderately large city some 127 km from Auckland, and is now the centre for a new study group. This Hamilton group, I an informed, has six new readers and is to some extent an offshoot development of the Taupiri reading group, though should be considered to be a new group in its own right. We, at Auckland are in contact with these regions and are working in conjunction with the Taupiri group to see what we can do to meet the needs of this new group. Some books are being prepared for supply as reading URANTIA Books.

## News From Switzerland

It was really a great experience to meet all the people who gathered in the sole purpose to work for our Father. Nicole and I thank you and your friends from the deepest of our hearts to have made this meeting possible and to have organized it in this beautiful manner. We returned home full of gratitude and joy to have found so many wonderful friends. In Melbourne, Steve Shanahan did his best to bring us together with other readers, so we truly experienced Australia from inside!

We are always very interested in the 6-0-6 Newsletter; its spirit is very good — very Australian — I think after our short stay — I mean very future-directed, enthusiastic and profound. Our good old Europe needs such qualities very much!

Here is a brief sumary of what I said at the conference.

Wherever people speak neither English nor French the language barrier is the great obstacle in spreading the Urantia message. In Switzerland there are 4 official languages: French, Cerman, Italian and Romansch. Therefore the only existing study group (20 members) is to be found in the French part.

Swiss people as a whole have more and more concentrated their efforts on material progress. The result is a kind of material paradise where everything functions, providing for the inhabitants a feeling of security. A developed sense of the beautiful accompanies the general and equally distributed wealth. But the large religious organizations have become empty mecharisms. True believers are increasingly meeting in little groups or sects. Still we are persuaded that under the surface of this apparent spiritual desert a religious spring is preparing. We need new men and women like the medieval Swiss statesman and deep thinker Niklaus von der Flüe who left this touching prayer:

My Father,

Take away from me everything that hinders me to You Give me everything that brings me closer to You Take me from myself and give me to You, totally.

Urs Ruchti, Uetliburg, Switzerland

## Black Holes And Neutron Stars

A thimbleful of matter from a neutron star would weigh about 100 million tons. For a black hole, the weight would be infinitely greater. It is not surprising that, until recently, astronomers regarded such fanciful objects as the play toys of theoretical physicists. Then, in the mid-1960's, the discovery of mysterious stellar objects, the pulsars and the quasars, completely changed the picture.

Dark bodies having gravitational pull such that light could not escape were predicted on theoretical grounds about 200 years ago by Michell and also by the French mathematician Laplace. The theory was based on Newton's corpuscular theory years later, Maxwell's wave theory of light put an end to such speculation at least until Newton's description of gravity was replaced by that of Einstein in the early part of this century. Einstein's theory allowed that light waves could be trapped by gravity, but the concept of Laplace's dark bodies remained a play toy for theoretical physicists until the discovery of pulsars and quasars using radio-telescopes. These strange objects appeared to have extraordinary large mass relative to their small size, an observation that forced the refocussing of attention upon speculative objects such as neutron stars and Laplace's dark bodies.

## Is The Milky Way Galaxy The Seventh Superuniverse Of Orvonton?

This is a question I have been trying to resolve for a long time. I have heard many people interpret the diverse and complex information given about this subject in _The URANTIA Book_ by simply stating that the Milky Way is Orvonton! After many months of study, I still am not convinced of this. Let me explain why.

To set the stage for this investigation, we need to begin by looking at two factors that diminish our ability to conclusively answer the question: the distortion of language, and the limitations of revelation. First, on p.1 the revelators explain their anticipation of problems that will arise because of their instructions to introduce no new terms when English terms were available, even if there might be distortion of meaning. Second, on p.1109 we are informed that they are forbidden to preclude the discoveries of humans by revelation and that many of their physical science statements may need revision in light of scientific progress and discovery. We are admonished not to discard the genuine historical and religious truths when this happens.
