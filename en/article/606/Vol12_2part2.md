## Planetary Invocations

_The following letter was sent to Six-O-Six from Portugal._

Dear Brethren,

The “CENTRO LUSITANO DE UNIFICACAO CULTURAL” is an entity that is gathering efforts in order to implant the keynotes of the New Age of 2,000 years which has recently begun (the Aquarius Age), namely Universalism and Liberty, and the expansion of an effective network of planetary Light.

The purpose of this letter is to invite you to participate in an energetic mental work of the utmost importance to the planet Earth (this work began in December 1990). We are acting merely as intermediaries and our aim is that the whole of mankind be informed and may cooperate if they so wish.

Therefore, in the next full moon and in all subsequent full moons, at 19:00 pm local time (or at a close hour as the value of this work will still be very important at any other time), a great plea should be made for the Earth's effective transmutation and passage from the Age of Fishes into the Age of Aquarius and for the reappearance of the Christ. This energetic concentration should be carried on for about 20 minutes beginning with the utterance of the Major Invocation and ending with the utterance of the Planetary Invocation.

We wish to enhance the universal, non-sectarian and non-entailing character of these concentrations, further to their powerful multiplying effect as performed by a large number of participants in many countries.

In the case that you should feel the appeal to cooperate in this work, we would be thankful if you would pass the information to other groups and/or men and women of goodwill. We would also be very pleased to hear from you any experience concerning this work.

Fraternal greetings in the Light, 

Centro Lusitano De Unificacao Cultural, 
Rua Rodrigo da Fonseca, 84 A 
1200 LISBOA, PORTUGAL.

### The Major Invocation

From the Sublime Presence which lays within our hearts
O Christ, oh our Redeemer,
Receive the Burning Flame of our Grand, Great Love. 
From the Real (and Royal) Presence which crowns our Minds
O Christ, oh Potentate,
Welcome our new-born Light and our awakening Power

From the timid embryo of our Intelligence, 
O Redeemer, oh Saint, 
Manufacture Thy stick and let Thy robe be woven.

Because we want forever to close the door to evil 
O Christ, oh Brother of ours,
Reveal Thy face to us and let us reach Thy hand!

Let the Light, the Love and the Power of the Father 
Be manifested by means of Thee 
Upon us, within us and through us, 
So that the Plan on Earth will be eternal! 
AUM

## Planetary Invocation

From the centre of the Universe, 
From the depth of the Being, 
From the heart of the Cosmos, 
Let Fire descend upon Earth! 
Let it burn out what is useless, 
Let it destroy all decay, 
Let it light new lights!

From the small presences
Within the hearts of the beings
Who dwell throughout the Earth, 
Let Fire rise to the sky!
Let the Flame lift up and shine!
Let the Flame melt form!
Let form no longer imprison!

The fires of matter and Spirit are but one! 
The whole Earth is Fire, Light and Christ! 
It is a Sun in the sky, a Star of Freedom!

I AM Love, I AM Light, I AM the Christ!

(Please note this is a first translation so it is necessarily imperfect.)

## Concerning Inner Guidance — A Cosmic Perspective

To the People of Urantia:

Many souls on your planet of Urantia claim to have a divine connection with their God. They claim to hear from God personally and uniquely. Yet throughout history, in the name of the voice of this inner God, they have murdered one another, ruled over one another, and have taken what little their brothers and sisters had in order to build temples, where some have said they heard from God even better.

_There have alwavs been_ the mixture of those who have truly heard from their inner God that has led them to great and wonderful ministries, in the service of their fellow brothers and sisters of your planet; and there have always been those who claim to also hear from God who wished to control others and hinder the true moving of the Spirit upon the earth.

The voice of God within an individual can be quite distorted, confused and vaguely heard, even with the most decent of people. This is due to pride, selfishness, vanity and the many perplexities of living in social orders that are inconsistent with the divine government that has not been able to take root upon this planet. Many people have claimed innate and objective communion with the Creator Son of Nebadon, Christ Jesus, whom we know to be Michael of Salvington and they know as their Father. They claim to be able to hear from Him individually, independent of even those their very Master gave to help them in their daily sojourns of life, as lived on a third dimensional fallen planet. Did not Jesus say that He gave some as apostles, some as evangelists, and some as teachers for the edification of the church (the church being those who claim to understand the threefold Spirit within them)? Yet those who make the claim to hear from the Spirit of Truth (the gift of the Creator Son, Michael, which is only one-third of the Trinity's voice), seem to have found themselves, even up to this day, in wars against their brothers and sisters they call infidels and pagans; in improper marriages and relationships; in careers of unfulfilment and wrong livelihood; and in general, many dying from diseases brought about by inappropriate thinking and living. From the Pope upon his throne to the lone monk in the solitude of the forest, this self-same Spirit seems to say different things to different people concerning truth.

## Seeing The World In A New Light

**From: TRIANGLES Bulletin 88, June 1989**

As a general rule, when we look at the world around us, what we see tends to be limited to the dense outer shell of the manifested universe. We can use our powers of insight and intuition to understand something of what lies behind the myriad faces of the phenomenal world but only those rare individuals gifted with second sight are able to actually see into the subtle levels of form. The powers of insight, intuition and intellect have, however, enabled humanity to invent tools and techniques that greatly refine our vision. Through the centuries these inventions have allowed us to penetrate many of the natural barriers that limit our sight.

In this century new techniques have dramatically transformed our view of the world. We can now use ultrasound to see inside matter; we can magnify the minutest objects tens of millions of times; we can, through infra-red light, actually see in the dark; we can use thermal cameras to see the world in terms of hot and cold; and we can use Kirlian electrophotography techniques to capture images of the energy fields that interpenetrate and surround all forms.

And still more advances are being made all the time. Early this year (1989) a new microscope in California enabled scientists to see for the first time the structural detail of DNA's double helix. A newspaper report stated that, until now, most information about DNA had been inferred and deduced from numerous experiments. The new microscope can record images of the structural detail of surfaces as small as a single atom. The report suggests that this invention could lead to major advances in the understanding of the building blocks of life because researchers can now “see” important relationships between DNA and proteins.

## Ascension

**Repersonalisation, Ascension, Fusion, Rematerialisation, Reconstruction, The Light Body and the Morontia Body are All Part of the Same Process.**

If ever there was an interesting controversy, it is the apparent denial in _The URANTIA Book_ of ‘reincarnation’. There are those who will accept this without question and there are many who question this denial due to their personal experience of becoming aware, sometimes intimately, of ‘other lives’ to the point where they feel these ‘other lives’ are their own. This assumption can be both true or false depending on the circumstances as well as semantics. Unfortunately, there are countless others who have been 'turned off to _The URANTIA Book_ because of this controversy who would have otherwise benefited greatly from this Revelation.

Keeping in mind _The URANTIA Book_ states that it is an incomplete and partial revelation, it is no wonder many ask why it did not go on to explain this attitude about reincarnation, or more accurately ‘repersonalisation’, especially since those of the Revelatory Commission are obviously intelligent enough to have known this would be unacceptable to thousands in spite of the fact that this Epochal Revelation was INTENDED to reach the multitude. For example, why doesn't it go on to say that there is no such thing as ‘reincarnation’ as you generally understand it on Urantia? That would have at least left the door open to further research and understanding of _The URANTIA Book_ by the many who, from personal experience, disagree.

Or further still, why doesn't it state that if you pursue a really in-depth study of this Revelation to the point of understanding the Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit and Her Adjutant Mind Spirits, the Seven Psychic Circles, etc., that it is possible to arrive at a **WORKABLE** understanding of how you may become conscious of ‘other lives’ which may or may not become other facets of your personality. It is possible not only to become conscious of other personalities within the mind system you are involved with, it is possible for certain evolutionary humans, through their own spirituality, to raise the frequency of their physical bodies (in varying degrees) to the point where they can dematerialize enough to allow those of a higher dimension to come in and share the vessel and **APPEAR** — **MANIFEST** — **DEMONSTRATE** to those who have begun to develop **SPIRITUAL VISION**. It is vital to understand spiritual vision which is the ability to SEE in multiple dimensions. Jesus repeatedly referred to SPIRITUAL VISION and it is often mentioned in _The URANTIA Book_:

## Every Now & Zen

**From SOUTHERNCROSSINGS, Volume, 1. Number. March 1991**

**A New Age Yogi's Lament**

With my legs all intertwined.
Nirvana fills my mind
As I sit on my bum
Chanting Aum, Aum,

I'm so much calmer
Since I studied Dharna;
Buddha
Woulda
Thought me real cool!

Eyes on the tip of my nose
Damn this lotus pose!
Discipline may be fine
For a spirit thatt's divine
But I've gone numb in the asana!
