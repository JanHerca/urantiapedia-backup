## “thought for the month”

> “A human being can find truth in his inner experience, but he needs a Clear knowledge of facts to apply his personal discovery of truth to the ruthlessly practical demands of everyday life.” (<a id="a58_194"></a>[UB 111:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_7))



## A Note From Six-O-Six

_I would like to welcome everyone back after our summer holiday break. More than ever we need to strengthen our ties around the world in that bond of Brotherhood, to strengthen our faith and maintain that inner peace which passes all understanding to neutralize the negativity that surrounds our planet._

**Madeline Noordzy**

## From Our Mailbox

### No Brainwashing

I would like to make a comment on the article in the November/December issue of 6-0-6 by Norm Du Val$ from Montana. While I concede that he has a very valid point in chiding both Ann Bendall and myself for speaking out against the E-3 tapes without listening to them, I must say in our defence that it must not be overlooked that there was extensive literature, describing the content of the tapes, enclosed with the newsletter which prompted our responses. Surely any literature describing a product is designed to whet the appetites of prospective buyers and I'm afraid this literature failed miserably. It did not even prompt a “maybe” in my view; in fact it said enough to give me cause to reject it. One must also take into account that if we were to read and listen to every message that every self-proclaimed prophet announced, we may never find time to study _The URANTIA Book_. So no, Norm, I have no fear of being brainwashed. If the E-3 message was of significant spiritual value I feel sure his descriptive literature of the content of the tapes would have prompted me to give them a hearing.

Thank you to Robert Crickett for his article “Coming to a 'Final Decision”'. He obviously has given the tapes a hearing and I appreciate his conclusions.

**Kathleen Swadling, Sydney**

---

_Editor's Note_

_To set the record straight, I would like to point out that Robert Cricket, according to my source of information, which was the person who played the tapes for him, listened to excerpts of 3 (out of 5) of the tapes. He made a draft of his article on the same day, finished writing it and posted it to me on the next day._

_There are telltale signs of this when he says “... an elite group are transported to some temporary haven ...”_

_As one reader pointed out: “Two billion people is an elite group? And the only entrance requirement is a sincere belief in God? How elite can that be?”_

_This same reader also remarks that Robert's paragraph beginning “The case for [1] would entail a mammoth literary work ...” and which ends “...theological studies at a university level can attest to that.” rather reminded him of the pharisees TELLING Jesus what the scriptures mean. He continues: “I an sure many prophets have been told ‘what the scriptures really mean’ by many learned scholars and thinkers.”_

_Several readers made the remark that Robert's case to come to a final decision certainly did not bring them any closer and that in fact no one was provoked to come to any decision, only to keep an open mind._

_Although Robert took neither the time nor the trouble to discuss with any of the people who had taken a much longer period of time to evaluate E-3's message and what their motivations were to take it seriously, yet took it upon himself to sit in judgment on them. I'll be the first one to admit to spiritual immaturity, but cannot help but wonder whether the superior tone of some of his statements would not bring a smile to the faces of our celestial friends. As _The URANTIA Book_ says, to a greater or lesser degree, we've all got it wrong anyway!_

_To assume that readers are being divided into two camps over this issue is a bit far-fetched. Australian readers are far too sensible for that. They know that the Father expresses Himself through many different channels, but underneath it all spiritually WE ARE ONE._

### A Word On Belief

Beliefs are always of a personal nature and in my opinion should remain so (this is not to say that some aspects of a “belief” cannot be shared). If what one believes is to themselves the truth — then so be it, however this does not mean that it is truth for anyone else. The same incident seen through several eyes is always reported differently. Beliefs are arrived at by a highly complex structure including education, background, perceptions, interpretations, intuitiveness, personality quirks etc. I see it as folly to take on board another person's beliefs, not only is this lazy but it negates all of the above elements required to reach a personal (which can be aligned with other's) belief.

I have listened to all of the E-3 tapes and have done some research of my own based on his interpretations of biblical and URANTIA Book events and using my own complex structure I come to a totally different conclusion. This being so I defend your right to pass on or publish anything you feel may be of interest to your readers.

### Keep It Up!

Today I received your November/December issue and read it through.

This was an excellent edition. I especially liked the article/reprint of Les Sheridan's analysis of the left and right brain. It made me think — and feel.

Through these trying times of the URANTIA movement, your work serves to bridge the old and the new, the Fellowship and the Foundation, those for Joe and those against. I find it personally stimulating that you present us with intellectually articulate information and mix in the news and humour for levity.

Thank you for your work. Keep it up.

### Spiritual Unity

We spent the end of the year with Urs and Nicole Ruchti in Switzerland. We had a good time, reading papers from Jesus' life This was uplifting and inspiring.

We read with great interest the Six-O-Six and we see with pleasure that the Australian readers are not in an intellectual uniformity but surely in spiritual unity.

Continue your good work with good courage and we love you all.

Your sister and brother...

### Modern Prophets

The last issues of 6-0-6 dealt substantially with the subject of Joe Pope's message. Over here in America, we were aware of this message before Joe discovered he had a fax-line with the higher ET powers of heaven. I am not joking, because, personally I am sure that our communication lines with the spiritual tutors, are in fact more sophisticated than we can express with our material words.

Ernest Moyer of Pennsylvania, had written some papers before Joe did, on the same subject. And, someone by the name of Michael X 20 years ago, has written quite a lot on the subject of evacuation. Michael advised people to keep developing FAITH, stay calm and ready, since the heavenly rescuing parties knew full well who we are and where we are. This Michael must have been a student of the book.

The Fifth Epochal Revelation, p. 582 has been the spark of these three cases just mentioned. But Michael X is also inspired by a passage of the book where it is said that on normal planets, most ascenders that have known the third stage of light anchorage, have to accept some kind of compensating duty, before leaving a local universe and switch into spirit form. I read Michael X some twenty years ago, but an enormous lot of accelerated events have taken place of late, and I could not have another look at those scripts since I keep giving those things away. I am busy scrutinizing the 2000 pages of the Blue Book. This book is like a huge library that no one can afford to go through, since it has the kaleidoscopic power, of revealing its input channels.

I personally do not believe that Providence would use in 1990, the type of prophets that were accommodating the world over 2500 years ago. I believe that Luther acted as a prophet 500 years ago. I believe that writers like Dickens and Hugo, with their keen sense of communication, were acting as precursors of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, and that Pope John the XXIII was most prophetic by his honest world-wide call for an inquiry into the deep secret lairs of our Christian faith, for finding some ways of spiritual renewal. God knows the art of marketing so much better than us human pee-wees we all are.

I receive over 20 Bulletins printed by our URANTIA groups. Some others had a rather short life. They will survive in as much as they improve gradually their conveying power and can help create a better sense of togetherness. We are all together, no doubt, but each one with his personal kind of togetherness. We all try to amplify our thinking, our talking, and it takes such a long time before we reach the art of fine-tuning.

_Editor's Note_

_I know of a few more revelations by extraterrestrials which tell us that the likelihood of an evacuation of this planet is great if we keep on going the way we are. They also tell us that this solar system, even the universe is in for a quantum leap in consciousness very soon. Urantia has been out of step for too long and it is effecting our whole system. We are not an island on our own but part of a larger creation. And they have been rather patient with us. However they all tell us there is nothing to fear if we have faith in God. I have also heard that the celestials are not particularly overjoyed with the performance of the URANTIA movement of late, but then one can't believe everything one hears. Why take any notice of anything that has come through since 1934? As long as we keep on reading those 2000 pages of the blue book “we'll be right, mate!” as we Aussies are prone to say._

_With this last remark, I'm not trying to have a go at you, Gerard. It just shows the human side of my nature, which sometimes becomes a bit frustrated with the ATTITUDE of the URANTIA movement in general, some factions of which seem to be more pre-occupied with organizational structures then the more important things at hand and that is the coming of the Sons of God. Those glorious Beings of Light who are with us on the planet right now. But none are so blind as those that will not see!_

_I believe that Joe is just one of many, including yourself, who are here at this time to do a particular job and until we learn to unify and pull in the same direction the task of our Elder Brothers will be so much more difficult._

there is a chance we might<br>
learn something new,<br>
When we speak,<br>
we are only repeating something<br>

### New Planetary Prince!

Announcement

June 1, 1990 AD

Dear Friends,

Those of you who have done your homework and diligently studied the FIFTH EPOCHAL REVELATION to the evolving races of your planet will better understand and grasp the significance of the following announcement. For those of you who have not done your homework and studied _The URANTIA Book_ I will briefly explain the announcement to you.

It is important to understand the following activities of Machiventa, one of the twelve Melchizedek Receivers who came here to “secure” the planet at the time of the Luciferian Rebellion. (Actually, these Receivers were here twice as they left upon the arrival of Adam and Eve and returned at the time of the Adamic default.)

### Caligastia's Visit!

August 18, 1990
PCL COMMUNIQUE

Caligastia's Visit to the Planetary Center of Light

About 2:45 PM, Saturday, August 11, 1990 we noticed a profound energy change. At precisely 3 PM Caligastia's spaceship anchored directly above the PLANETARY CENTER OF LIGHT accompanied by an appropriate Light Escort. (There is a Starship anchored over this area.) The thunder and energy bursts (like lightning) were stunning. When the CONTACT between Caligastia's ship and the PCL was made everything went off... electricity stopped. There were bursts of “lightning” both outside and INSIDE the room. In a quick series of three energy bursts Caligastia was in the room. For almost four hours there was a Hierarchy meeting here which had to do with the surrender of Caligastia the purpose of which was to prevent further waste such as the bloodshed of the prime stock of Urantians lined up in the Middle East for massacre/sacrifice.

### Statement Of Intent

I, Machiventa Melchizedek, Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia make this statement:

God intends for me to make ready the peoples inhabiting the Planet Urantia for the arrival of Prince Michael, Son of God.

This work as Vicegerent consists of gathering those persons who do hear, who do see, who do understand GOD. This gathering of persons shall eventually spread light, truth, love throughout humankind.

I used the term “Correcting time”, this terminology has been coined to give humankind some indication of the intent. To correct something is to alter course. This alteration of course may take some considerable time/space in your terms. There is no way a time frame can be allocated for this. It is dependent entirely on individual humankind acceptance and understanding.

I shall be working with the co-operation of certain chosen persons. This communication is being delivered through one such. There are others, and there may be others, also dependent again on humankind acceptance and understanding, never forgetting the freewill of humankind.

Abraham is “used” by myself as a “scouting party” and in turn I am “used” thus. We make ready.

This is my Statement of Intent.

Thank you.

## A Message From Gabriel

To All Our Beloved Creations Walking On The Beautiful Planet Earth:

It is with Joy in my heart and jubilation on my lips that I am once again The Harbinger elect who bears Good News to Mankind.

I, GABRIEL, Arch-Angel of the Realm, have indeed glad tidings to convey. Humanity has turned the corner at last, after Centuries of Darkness and unenlightened thought, and at last is headed for the Light, walking, no, actually running together on the path back to God, our beloved Creator.

Daily new progress is made and all those Souls who have dragged behind and hindered this progress — so dear to our hearts — have also surged forward and requested the help of the Christ.

At long last they also saw fit to change their minds and no longer walk in isolation with their eyes fixed firmly on the material substance, but have now included others in their view of life. Even the animals have taken on a new lease and are eager to improve their own awareness, following, as usual, in your footsteps.

## Dear White Fellow

Dear white fellow,
When I was born I was black
When l grew up I was black
When I get sick I am black
When I get scared 1 am black
When I choke I am black:
When I get embarrassed I am black
And when I die I am still black

But you white fellow,
When you were born you were pink.
When you grew up you were white
When you get sick you are yellow:
When you get scared you are green
When you choke you are blue
When you get embarrassed you are red.
And when you die you are purple
And you've got the nerve to call he coloured!.

**Author unknown**

## We're Talking About Attitudes

What a 36 page Tenth Anniversary Issue wasn't able to do, my article “From E.T. to E-3” apparently was, and that is, evoke a response!

My remark on not wanting to turn into a URANTIA Book fundamentalist was not meant as a personal accusation against anyone, but rather as a warning for the whole readership, including myself, about the ATTITUDE of the fundamentalist that nothing shall be added.

If however anyone feels that the shoe fits, then so be it. I have no argument with the beliefs of the fundamentalist or anyone else's beliefs for that matter. It would be foolish to do so. Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ tell us on page 1260 that to a greater or lesser degree we've all got it wrong anyway?

However experience has shown me what the attitude of the fundamentalist can lead to. Like this true story where a fundamentalist said to a “non-believer”: “You realize of course that you won't go to heaven”.

## The New Order

As the soft, brilliant clouds gather in the sky at sunset, so are My Forces gathering for the sunset of the old order of affairs. The clouds are gathering in a glory of the cosmic colours, so are those forces gathering in a glory of Cosmic Power.

Many are becoming more and more aware from day to day, of the wondrous universe in which they dwell. As the evening quiet falls over the land, even the birds stilling their song of the sunlit hours, so does the calm and peace of My Presence come to dwell in the hearts that are truly open to Me. And so even as you watch the change from brilliant day to star lit night, calmly and without fear, even so shall you watch from your haven of My Love, the changes which are taking place in My Universe. For a time, to those who understand not, it will seem that the light is fading and that darkness shall surely cover the land. But to My Children, those who know their Unity with the Father of all, shall come a quiet peace and they shall know that after the seeming darkness, the Sun of Righteousness shall surely rise again with healing in His Wings the old order of sin, disease, nans hatred of man, and all the train of evil which follows, shall be no more. but only Peace, Love and Righteousness shall be recognized as the reality of all things ponder this message. Few are read to receive it now but by your conscious knowing you may join in the great a wakening of the New Day which is at hand.

**From The writings Of Eva Bell Werber**



## A Reincarnation Explanation

**From: THE CIRCLES Winter 1990**

_The URANTIA Book_ states that human beings do not reincarnate, yet many religions teach reincarnation. There are also many books about reincarnation, many of which include personal accounts of earlier lives remembered.

Before I became acquainted with _The URANTIA Book_, I read many books on Eastern and Western religions, mysticism, and materials which are now labeled “New Age”. When I found _The URANTIA Book_, I lost interest in them for the bits and pieces of truth that I found in them could not compare to the feast that I found in _The URANTIA Book_. I have never questioned the book's truth, and I have enjoyed matching our expanding knowledge of geology, science, space, and even my own religious experience with _The URANTIA Book_. When human knowledge does not comply with the book, I normally await further expansion of human knowledge.

I have, however, been perplexed at the beliefs and writings about reincarnation, in contrast to the book's flat statement that there is no reincarnation. _The URANTIA Book_ does state that many things had been left unexplained about what really happens at death.

## He Who Has Ears To Hear

It is already six months down the track since the publication of my article “From E.T. to E-3”. Since that time I have received a lot of information, sometimes direct, sometimes indirect about messages from our unseen friends, which have come through various channels.

Instead of becoming sidetracked by concentrating on the personalities of these channels, I have carefully read them, listened to them and tried to evaluate them to the best of my ability. And it is amazing how they dovetail! New vistas have opened up. A gigantic cosmic plan is slowly being revealed.

As editor of Six-O-Six, I feel I would fail in my duty if I did not pass this information on. Neil Francey and Tony Rudd, my co-editors, also are of the same opinion. We give you this information and leave it to the Spirit of Truth within you to guide you in whether you want to accept it or not.

Quite a few readers may already have heard or read it, but others may not. As there is far too much material to publish in one newsletter, I'll make a list and anyone who wants to follow it up, can either write to me or ring me on (03) 561-6089.

## A Tale Of Two Ants

Two ants, Brilly and Ignor, were standing together on their tennis ball one day, having one of their regular philosophical discussions.

Ignor claimed triumphantly: “I reckon I've discovered infinity!”

“How's that?” asked Brilly.

“Well, you know what infinity is, don't you? It's something that goes on and on and on and no matter how hard you try, you never get to the end”, Ignor explained.

“Go on.”

“Well, I figure that if I walk in a straight line across this green furry world of ours, I can walk for ever and ever and never get to the end. I'd never go backwards, always forwards, always at a constant speed, deviating neither left not right. I could walk forever, an infinite distance”, he concluded.

## A Visit Home

_Editor's Note_

_Inspired by the joy, the love and the peace present on a hill at East Warburton, where we could almost touch the clouds, Elfie wrote this beautiful piece after our group meditation on one of those crisp mornings during the last conference._

I slip between morning sun and bird song
To the quiet of the sky.
“Whereto little traveller?”
“A visit home my Lord — oh please!”
“Your work is not complete.”
“Yes I know — a few moments only, this I need.”
“Go then, but quick.”
And quick I went, as fast as thought,
To a distant star
In Orion's mighty belt.
And words cannot describe the joy
Of a welcome by “US ALL”.
Straight to the heart of the fire,
Touched by each mind flame.
Here no need of words
Communion is a music
