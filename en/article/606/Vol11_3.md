_Some of you may have noticed that Six-O-Six has moved into the “computer age”. Starting with the Tenth Anniversary issue, Six-O-Six made use of computer based word processing and publishing. All articles from now on are typed onto word processor first, for later use in a published format. I now have an IBM Based word processing computer and if any contributors are in a similar position, it will greatly facilitate typing if any contributions made could be supplied on 5&frac14; floppy disk as well as the hard copy form._

_Six-O-Six Newsletter is a bimonthly publication dedicated to promote international goodwill and understanding between readers of The URANTIA Book_.

## Melbourne Conference Update

So far 9 people have registered early for the Australian Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers, to be held on Melbourne Cup weekend, Saturday, November 3 — Tuesday November 6, 1990. As Melbourne probably has more URANTIA Book readers than any other capital in Australia we are expecting a lot more registrations to come in! We like to remind you that registrations should be in by Friday August 3. Please note two minor variations to times: a) arrival Saturday morning is after 11 a.m. (not 9.30 a.m.) b) arrival Friday evening is after 5 p.m. (previously 5.30 p.m.)

We have chosen Arrabri Lodge at Warburton East, 80 ~km east of Melbourne, as our venue. This charming old lodge is nestled at the foot of the Great Dividing Range, not far from Mount Donna Buang with its beautiful rainforest, where the myrtlebeech trees are believed to be a thousand years old.

Warburton in the springtime, with its many rhododendron and azalea gardens, is a real tourist attraction.

Please see the invitation and booking form in your March/April Newsletter for more details.

A few people have requested the opportunity to present papers.

There is a small group of people who will lead the conference theme of “Living as we are meant to live”. They have agreed and committed themselves to a four month programme of daily prayer and co-ordinated reading (every 3 days), from July through to October.

If you wish to share that part of their preparation and register by June 18 , we will send you a copy of their programme for those months.

If you are unable to attend the conference but would still like a copy, just write to Six-O-Six and request a copy by June 18.

## From Our Mailbox

Thank you so much for your kind and lovely letter. Yes we miss Henry, but on the other hand we feel very happy that he made a quick and peaceful farewell. I am also grateful for your articles in the Six-O-Six Newsletter. We are truly very interested in your periodical. A few weeks ago we made copies for our readers of Ann Bendall's article “Spiritualised Thinking”.

So please send us 6-0-6. Henry and I always found it one of the best periodicals. Thank you for remembering Henry. Give my love and thanks to Irene and Wolfgang.

We are going on with the work here. Study groups and translating.

**Baukje Begemann, Wassenaar, The Netherlands.**

Very many thanks for the issue of the “Tenth Anniversary of Six-O-Six Newsletter” which I was so pleased to receive. I have found it interesting and absorbing reading much of the material new to me. I can appreciate just how many long hours of labour must have gone into the compilation of it and I feel your team are to be commended for the very good job you have done in putting it together.

**Nancy Dempster, Melbourne.**

## Conclusive Proof, Or Is It?

Many articles I have read both from the Six-O-Six Newsletter and from overseas sources describe different reader's opinions about what we should do with _The URANTIA Book_. Should we shout it openly from the roof tops? Should we keep it in plain paper covers and pass it furtively between one another? Should it just be interesting reading?

Whatever approach readers believe is right, they all seem to be characterised by a common thread, and that is to use _The URANTIA Book_ itself to support whatever beliefs they hold. If some quotes can be found to support those beliefs, then the quotes themselves prove them to be right. When people are asked why they believe certain things or behave in a certain way, the quotes are used as the reason rather than their original belief — “_The URANTIA Book_ says so.”

Adopting a similar approach,I would like to use _The URANTIA Book_ to support my belief that Hitler's approach was on the right track. He maintained that the Aryan race, the fair-haired, blue-eyed Nordic type hailing from the northern temperate regions, was superior.

Could he have been referring to the violet race, as mentioned in _The URANTIA Book_? They are described in almost identical terms as having “_...had blue eyes...fair complexions and light hair colour..._” (<a id="a109_206"></a>[UB 76:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_1))

Hitler also held Negroes to be inferior. _The URANTIA Book_ also says “_...so the black man were the least progressive._” (<a id="a111_123"></a>[UB 64:6.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_25))

And to further reinforce the similarities, _The URANTIA Book_ goes on to say that “_...before these people are blended, the inferior and unfit are largely eliminated._” (<a id="a113_170"></a>[UB 51:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_8)) Hitler would have approved.

In “Mein Kampf”, Hitler described the role of the Aryan as follows: “He is the Prometheus of mankind from whose bright forehead the divine spark of genius has sprung at all times, forever kindling anew the fire of knowledge which illuminated the night of silent mysteries and thus caused man to climb the path to mastery over the other beings of this earth.” (“Mein Kampf”, page 263)

Apart from correctly identifying the mission of the violet race on earth, had he not even recognised the divine origin of the race in this telling quote?

Hitler wanted to breed a superior race. Does not _The URANTIA Book_ say that Adam and Eve wanted to do the same thing? “_Adam... had selected 1,682 of the highest type of women... and these women were impregnated with the Adamic life plasm._” (<a id="a119_244"></a>[UB 76:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_8))

The further I dug into both sources, the more I came up with more **conclusive proof** to support my belief. With some justification, one could even call “Mein Kampf” a forerunner of the truths of _The URANTIA Book_ as it came out 35 years earlier. And it did a terrific job of spreading the word being at the time of Hitler's death, twice as popular as _The URANTIA Book_ today, selling 9 million copies in 15 languages — all in half the time!

My conclusions are clearly ridiculous. But I challenge anyone to find fault with the logic of my argument. Others who use _The URANTIA Book_ to **prove** their beliefs also probably have similar watertight defences. But what does it really “prove”? What is the point of using _the URANTIA Book_ to support your beliefs if you can use it to **conclusively prove** anything you like?

Let's remember that it is an personal journey that we are making. If in your heart of hearts, conclusions lead you to live your life in a certain way, then go for it with all the verve and gusto you can muster. But I think it is a dangerous mistake to then assume that because you have used _The URANTIA Book_ to “conclusively prove” that you are “right”, then ipso facto, everybody else must be “wrong”.

## A Sigh Of Relief

The changes which have been taking place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union seemed to catch almost everyone by surprise. Extraordinary changes seemed to come from nowhere, making us wonder whether seraphim, midwayers and other agents of universe administration may have been slowly fostering developments which have suddenly come to fruition without apparent antecedents, at least from the human point of view.

Another striking phenomenon associated with these events is the evidence of strong religious inclinations among people who for several generations have lived in a completely secular environment in which religious attitudes were **officially** regarded as outmoded relics of a superstitious, pre-scientific era. In some cases, religious beliefs have been regarded as evidence of insanity. Yet as soon as the new attitude of openness was adopted, millions of believers in God began openly to celebrate this belief.

This persistence of belief should not be surprising in view of the history of religious persecution. But there did, for a while, seem to be something special about the modern form of secular totalitarianism, which made us wonder. The deliberate policy to create “socialist man” in the secular materialist would had given rise to the adoption of techniques of mass indoctrination which at one stage gave the appearance of succeeding. The frank pessimism of intellectuals like George Orwell, who wrote “Nineteen-Eighty-Four” at the height of this fear of “brainwashing”, as it was called, seemed to suggest that the combination of ruthless terror, modern psychology and complete control of information may actually succeed in eradicating all vestiges of the individual religious impulse. The widespread effectiveness of advertising in the Western world caused thinkers to overlook its essentially trivial nature, and were deceived into thinking that its superficial effectiveness could be duplicated when applied to the really profound and significant human functions and reactions. Certain intellectuals, such as Arthur Koestler, for instance, had direct experience of “brainwashing”, and were amazed by its subtlety. So there was widespread concern that this time round, the secularists just might succeed, and that the totalitarians could conceivably be able to regress men back to mere animals again by the use of these clever modern techniques.

Happily, they could not do it, and the evidence of their failure is now exposed to the gaze of all mankind. Students of _The URANTIA Book_ will not be surprised that the combination of humans and Thought Adjusters, no doubt with a little help from their unseen friends, have proved more than a match for the sophistry of secular humanism. But for a long time the issue really did seem to be in doubt, and believers in God everywhere must be having a collective sigh of relief that the doubt is lifted.

## Reborn — A True Story

There was a man who was beginning to believe that his youth was but a dream — a time of naivety and false idealism — and that now, in his adult life he was discovering what life was really about:

Sometimes you win,

Sometimes you lose,

Sometimes you're happy,

Sometimes you're sad,

Such is life.

I say he was **beginning** to believe this, for he secretly hoped that it was not so (even though many of his peers and elders, even his whole society in its ethos, affirmed that indeed it was so).

After weeks and months of this preponderance he arrived at the sobering thought that he simply had to know one way or the other, for he feared for his sanity should such a conflict continue.

He went to a favourite spot at the top of a cliff overlooking the wide, wild sea, and there he called out:

"God, if you exist as they say,

Let me know of your love,

Lest my hope be in vain

And my pessimism be realism."

And at that very moment he was reborn.

## Survival Of The Luckiest?

**Reprinted with permission from PRINTS OF PEACE, Vol IV, No 3, February 1990.**

This is a brief summary of an interesting documentary I saw in early January on CBC's, “The Journal”. It was about the creatures of the Burgess Shale in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rockies. Between the layers of rock there are the most finely detailed fossils in the world, showing everything from the hairs on their legs, to their last meal. Some 530 million years ago, this area was completely submerged and in this Cambrian ocean lived a bizarre collection of beasties the likes of which have all but disappeared from the earth's unique fauna. One day, long ago, a mud slide conspired to preserve for us a perfect record of these creatures who lived during one of the most important periods of our geologic history; that 100 million year period during which life on earth blossomed. It was called the Cambrian Explosion, which started about 570 million years ago. Since then, the elements have whittled away at the peaks and exposed the story of their creation.

Life on earth evolved quickly from glorified algae to the ancestors of all modern life. Its preservation here was a geologic accident. The shale was once a cliff, a sheer drop to the bottom of a salt water sea and its inhabitants were the teeming underwater curiosities of Cambrian life.

## Adventures In Spiritual Living

**From: THE CIRCLES* Spring-Summer 1990**

The fragrance of the coming Spiritual Springtime is even now discernible. Daily there are more and more people who are seeking spiritual answers to the questions raised by their daily lives. More and more do we see our brothers turning their faces to the true spirit of Jesus' gospel, the true meaning of his portrayal of our Father as a loving, merciful and accessible friend of every person.

The Adventures in Spiritual Living team was formed to develop a program that will help adventures program attendees to learn how to experience a very close relationship with the Father. Each Adventures Team member has made a commitment to explore techniques for deepening the relationship with the Father and to share these techniques with others.

The initial team spent almost a year designing a program to be presented at The Adventures in Spiritual Living Retreat at Mo Ranch in October, 1989. They learned many things from their preparations: making group decisions through consensus processes rather than through majority rule, seeking and being receptive to help from our unseen friends, involving Michael and our Father in every step of the process. They learned to value each other's talents and motives even while recognizing deficiencies and flaws. They learned to listen with their hearts, to be receptive to ideas without barriers or arguments, and they learned to accept and pool their guidance. Each exercise that was to be presented at the retreat was tested, improved, and tested again. With each testing, new insights into God's readiness to be personally and actively involved in every person's life were learned.

The retreat itself was a moving experience. The participants still describe it as illuminating and uplifting, even life-changing. They walked away with a better awareness of their relationship with our Father. The Adventures Team was pleased beyond their expectations. They yearned to bring this experience to still more people. A new and larger group was born, augmented by some participants in the first retreat.

The Adventures Team members have committed a portion of their time, energy, and resources to bringing this type of experience to anyone who seeks it. The team has evolved into an on-going association of God-loving individuals whose goal is to serve the God-seeking. The plans at present include four more retreats in 1990 . There are various printed materials that will be made available soon. Ideas for new projects occur much more rapidly than they can be implemented. Plans are underway to initiate a regular giving program as well as special funds solicitation to support out-of-pocket expenses for publication and travel related to the programs.

We are excited about what we are doing. We see our activities as a part of the coming spiritual springtime. We feel that teaching the good news of the kingdom to our brothers and sisters and assisting them in establishing a closer relationship with our Father will enhance their perception of the spiritual opportunities that are available to them. This in turn will bring about spiritually uplifting events in their lives.

The joy of this type of spiritual sharing uplifts our lives. If each of us shares his joy with others and they with others, soon our planet will be bathed in the joy of spiritual attainment. Then the spiritual springtime can begin in earnest and lead our planet to what is promised as “_one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs._”(<a id="a213_337"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)7)

If you would like more information about our group, please write to: Adventures in Spiritual Living, C/- THE CIRCLES, P.O. Box 1203, Arlington, TX. 76004-1203, U.S.A. We would love to hear from you.

## A Dangerous Book?

That comment first came from a bookseller who may have been worried about the possible effects of _The URANTIA Book_ on the sale of religious and occult books. But perhaps it really is dangerous?

When we read the piece on <a id="a225_26"></a>[UB 155:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_17) that the faintest flicker of faith will ensure that we mortals get another chance on the mansion worlds, we may feel confident that we should place the Book in the hands of anybody to whom we can sell it or give it as a gift. However when we come to <a id="a225_322"></a>[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2) and learn that if professed believers yield not the fruits of the spirit in their lives then they are dead ducks, maybe we need second thoughts.

Why the enormous difference between the two sentiments? Perhaps the flicker of faith applies only to those who dwell in ignorance of the true revealed Father-God of Jesus, while the second statement applies to those who are familiar with the concepts of this Father-God?

What then if I push _The URANTIA Book_ onto someone who is not spiritually ready to accept it? Am I doing them a favour, or have I made a ghastly mistake?

Think of the Pharisees who were sent by the Sanhedrin to observe Jesus. They witnessed his works, they heard his word, and they knew what he was on about. Did the flicker of faith bit apply to them?

Jesus addresses such Pharisees:

> “_Many of you have this day come to the parting of the ways; you have come to the beginning of the making of the inevitable choice between the will of the Father and the self-chosen ways of darkness. And as you now choose, so shall you eventually be._” (<a id="a235_256"></a>[UB 153:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p4_4))

Most of them chose the axe, while their ignorant mates back in Jerusalem went on with their ritual cleansings — and maybe yet another chance.

Rumour has it that those who received the original URANTIA Papers were warned to go easy about pushing it out into the world. In fact many thought that they would not live to see the day the Papers would be published. Permission was given after a twenty year wait, presumably for good reasons. Rumour also has it that the warning about pushing the Book into the public arena was not withdrawn. So maybe we should still be trying to prepare the way for the full message of _The URANTIA Book_ — perhaps for a few hundred years yet?

Remember, _“impatience is a spirit poison_” (<a id="a241_45"></a>[UB 48:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_20)). And we might poison our mates as well. A dangerous book? It is worth thinking about.

## Is Jesus Still In The Tomb Of Formalized Religion?

I must share with you a lovely experience of one Sunday.

I was “switching off”, removing all unwanted foliage from my potential garden, in the rain, when a car came up the driveway and out stepped two (obviously) Jehovah Witnesses. I felt myself getting annoyed, because, despite the fact that my steep driveway should be a deterrent to all, bar the truly determined, I have averaged one visit per month from different members of this sect, when my friends balked at my property access.

I straightened my shoulders, thanked them for their offer of a free copy of “The Watchtower”, and pointed out that I had my own religious convictions which differed from theirs. The lady asked me my opinion on the future of this planet, and I stated: “Very bright and rosy, going onto Light and Life, might take a bit of time, like 20,000 years, but what is time where eternity is concerned.” She replied: “But wouldn't it be lovely if we could all try to be like Jesus!”

I stopped, did some quick reassessing, scrubbed from my mind all pre-conceived ideas and started to listen to these people.

We spent a lovely half hour agreeing with each other. The lady said how she hated the thought that one single soul on this planet is to be lost, that we are all God's children and He wants all of us to come to Him.

It is my considered opinion that The Spirit of Truth is shining through these people of a sect, which once I regarded as the most fundamentalist of the lot. They are not quoting the Old Testament, or Revelations to any great extent; it is all the New Testament, and in particular Jesus' word!

I look at the Catholic Church and they speak of living as Jesus lived, the same with the Uniting Church, and quite possibly, numerous other denominations, which I have not had the opportunity to meet.

Is it not wonderful, and exciting to see Jesus becoming the Living Jesus within the institutions? And those people are not blessed with _The URANTIA Book_. They are succeeding purely through their love of God and Jesus, and their fellow human beings, and it is unblocking all spiritual channels.

This may be of interest to others who feel that Jesus is still in the tomb of formalized religion. He is not, he is alive, well and growing rapidly!

## News From The Foundation

The URANTIA Foundation reports among other things:

1. They are preparing the fifth printing of the French translation. In an effort to improve the quality of the French version of _The URANTIA Book_, the Foundation is exploring the possibility of revising the current translation or, more likely, commissioning a new one.
2. The Spanish translation is now in its final editing stages. Its cost, initially estimated to be $350,000 — which was raised through a special fund-raising campaign — is likely to exceed that amount.
3. The Finnish translation is also in its final stages of editing. It was done on a volunteer basis with donations from the Finns, without any broad-based URANTIA Foundation fund-raising campaign to support translation work or eventual publication. The Foundation must now raise the money to pay editing and printing costs. 
4. Interest has been expressed in translations of _The URANTIA Book_ into Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian. Future translations will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of funds.
5. The 10th printing of _The URANTIA Book_ will soon be available, including a new dust jacket that refers to a wider range of passages.
6. The text of _The URANTIA Book_ has been converted into electronic format and is being checked for accuracy. If the Foundation's resources permit, the Trustees will make this text available for purchase, so that readers can use it with their personal computers. This will enable users to find sought-for words and phrases almost instantaneously.
7. The Trustees are seriously considering offering an electronic concordance using the text of _The URANTIA Book_ already in computer form.
8. The Foundation is exploring the possibility of a printed concordance — an exhaustive listing of all the words in _The URANTIA Book_ and where they occur.
9. They are also looking into the possibility of an index, which would list concepts, subjects, and themes.
10. Once the questions of copyright protection, technical procedures, and recording format have been resolved, funds will be raised to make an audio version of _The URANTIA Book_.
11. The Foundation will continue to supply free copies of _The URANTIA Book_ for placement in libraries. This project will ultimately be supervised by the new URANTIA Brotherhood Association. They welcome participation by URANTIA Societies and individual readers in placing copies in libraries.
12. The Foundation will continue with the Gift Book Program and the Book Consignment Program.
13. The Trustees will continue to work for the distribution of the Book and its translations through normal channels, so as to increase their availability throughout the world. (Australia is still hopeful to have an official book distributor appointed soon.)
14. While the new URANTIA Brotherhood Association is being organized, the Foundation will continue to provide reader support services such as answering readers questions and referring inquirers to nearby individual students and study groups. Once fully in operation the Association will assume these functions.
15. While avoiding official interpretations of _The URANTIA Book_ and the development of “gurus”, the Trustees will continue to work for the preparation of qualified individuals to enhance the understanding and dissemination of _the URANTIA Book_'s teachings. They believe that the URANTIA Brotherhood Association will largely assume this task.
16. Consistent with the Foundation's guiding principles, the Trustees will continue to encourage the formation of study groups at home and abroad.
17. In all its projects, the primary goal of the Foundation is to keep the text of _The URANTIA Book_ inviolate free from any interpretive distortions or cultural biases and free from control by individuals and groups who might want to impose their own ideas on how it and its teachings should be studied and disseminated. By maintaining the text unchanged, uninterpreted, and accessible to the public in as many languages as possible, while supporting the growth of thousands of study groups and providing them with objective study aids, we believe that the content and message of _The URANTIA Book_ will eventually find their way into the hearts and minds of truth-seeking men and women all over the planet.

The Foundation believes that the programs described above will help the truths of _The URANTIA Book_, by themselves, accomplish their revelatory purposes. Given time and freedom from needless or smothering human interference, the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ will achieve a fulfillment far exceeding our imaginations. _The URANTIA Book_ can stand on its own; it does not require the efforts of ambitious leaders or marketing plans. Would you light a candle to illuminate a searchlight?

The Trustees of the Foundation would appreciate positive and forward-looking suggestions concerning the structure of the new URANTIA Brotherhood Association, and will give all such suggestions serious and thoughtful consideration. They welcome the help and suggestions of anyone who desires to work with them in ways that respect the Principles of Minimal Organization, Proper Procedures, and Slow Growth.

## Do You Dare?

Do you dare? do you dare? do you date to really care
to simply be my friend and let me be?
I don't need your helping hand if it's there to make demands.
Your real gift is your person, don't you see?
It's not the things you do but the uniqueness that is you
that helps me find in Jesus strength I need
Do you dare? do you dare? do you dare to just be there
while Jesus works his miracle in me.
Do you dare? do you dare? do you dare to really share:
to let me make my own mistakes and grow?
Don't rob ne of my pain... my mistakes are not in vain
They're mine for growth so let ne work 'em through
I'm only human too. I'll male mistakes like you
Let's try to help each other as we go
Do you dare? do you dare? to not be rude and stare
Reach out your hand to help but hot impair.
Do you dare? do you dare? do you dare to just be fair
to share your talents, then in God let go?
For the time must come you know when you have to let me go
Just gift me with yourself and set me free?
If you've stood there by my side... been open not to hide
you've gifted me with integrity and pride
Do you dare? do you dare? expose the belief that's there
your faith in God, in self and in me too?
Do you dare? do you dare? do you dare to really wear
the cost of not demanding I be you?
I am unique you see... and can only gust be me 
so let me listen to God's call within
Challenge me to grow and share the things you know 
but don't put out your hang aps onto me
Do you dare? do you dare? to let your life declare
the right I have to my own destiny.

As from July, our newsletter will just be called Six-OSix. Neil Francey and myself will be co-editors with Tony Rudd as advisor and helping us with the printing. Any correspondence may still be sent to 2 Salisbury Court, Glen Waverley, Victoria, AUSTRALIA.
