## An Association Presses Many Buttons

It was with interest that I read the article by Kathleen, Trevor and William in the previous 6-0-6 Newsletter. Generally I can identify with their thoughts regarding the direction and formation of a Urantia group in Australia.

Their last paragraph summarizes the situation. “Some of the benefits of forming an association, when in these early stages, is to have a centralised body that could keep us in touch with the outworkings and progress of the Urantia movement which would be beneficial to readers — a body which can implement our common goals.”

At the 1984 conference it was decided to investigate a means and vehicle to express and carry out functions that are of interest to _the Urantia Book_ readers.

During 1985 at a meeting in Melbourne and also in Sydney, the topic was discussed and ideas aired. The general feeling at the time expressed the need for a legal vehicle and the one most befitting our requirements was the format of an association.

Various options were explored at the time, including those of question. ing the validity of forming such a group. Letters were exchanged with the Foundation in America, giving further insight. Dabate amongst our friends and within ourselves still continues on this topic. Many opinions and ideas fluctuate and change as we continuously assess the situation and evaluate from different perspectives. The ability to change and grow, proceed and flow is a healthy one and keeps us in the ‘now’ as regards our needs.

When working with a group energy, sometimes it is hard to distinguish between our own needs and the group's needs. A person can be very knowledgable on spiritual topics, but because of personality conditioning, have very unspiritual like actions as perceived by another person. I bring this point up to emphasize that without communion with our Thought Adjuster, we are human beings, conditioned by inner drives and environmental upbringing. Hence an ‘Association’ presses many ‘buttons’ displayed on our chest. Usually fear, power, authority etc., but not always. Quite often these buttons could be anger, high ideals, glamour, pride. I don't mention these qualities as negative aspects, since many attributes can be utilized positively.

Honesty with oneself and sincerety of motive are healthy attributes in viewing an ‘Association’, and by this process we learn what are our needs and what are the group's needs, and after a process of growth, both can be perceived as one.

## Guidelines For Progress

Berkeley Elliott, Chairman of the International Fellowship Committee, sent us a copy of “Guidelines for Progress”. “It is meant,” as Berkeley puts it, “to be like a friendly hand reaching out to each other, all over the world”. All International Urantia Book readers are invited to five their input and opinion. If you have any comments and thoughts on changes, approval or disapproval, please write to Six-0-Six and we will publish them in our newsletter.

## Purpose

The long range purpose of our organization is to bring man to God and God to man — the spiritual transformation of mankind — beginning with ourselves and reaching out to each other all over the planet.

## Guidelines

1. The spiritual foundation of our organization is our belief in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
2. We believe that God is the only true end. _The URANTIA Book_ is a means to the end. Our organization is a means to the end.
3. As a group, our primary purpose is to study and disseminate the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. As individuals, our primary purpose is to begin the supreme adventure of actually attempting to live these teachings — to practice the presence of God in our daily lives through prayer and worship and through ministry and love.
4. Members of our organization may continue to belong to an established religious faith or may be unaffiliated religionists seeking to know God. Our main requirement for membership is the desire to know God.
5. We have created our organization to serve the people, and not the other way around. We respect the dignity of each individual. Our focus is on the growth of the individual. We cherish our differences, but we are always seeking the divine and perfect way to do things
6. In matters of spirit we recognize but one ultimate authority — the loving God of all creation as He may express Himself in our group consciousness. Our leaders are but trusted servants, they do not govern.
7. Our leaders will always be elected volonteers. Leadership positions will not be salaried positions, but we may employ special workers when needed.
8. As a group, we will in no way become involved in politics or issues of social or economic change that would divert us from our spiritual purpose. We will announce no “group” opinion on outside issues. The name “URANTIA” will not be drawn into public controversy by group actions. We will be obedient to the laws of the Country in which we live.
9. As part of a worldwide movement for planetary progress, we will work with other groups within the movement in a spirit co-operation. In particular, we will assist URANTIA Foundation wherever possible in its task of protecting _The URANTIA Book_ and the concentric circles symbol that identifies the URANTIA organizations.

## The relativity of Truth

Once an adventurous little Hottentot from southerm Africa ran away from home. After a long journey durin, which he became a stowaway on a cruiser, he arrived in Sydney. For days he strolled around this big city until one day he stoor in front of a large hole in the ground. Noisy machi. nery that seemed like huge monsters to him, made the hole even bigger. As he stood there, wondering what it all was about, somebody slapped him on the back and said: “That's gonna be the Sydney Opera House mate!” The little Hottentot who wasn't familiar with the melodious sounds of good old Aussie lingo, thought he heard: “That's the Sydney Opera House” Soon he became homesick and returned to his native Africa. Along with many other stories he told his tribesmen: “I've seen the Sydney Opera House”, and he described it just the way he saw it. A large hole in the ground with noisy big monsters crawling around in it. And all the other Hottentots were amazed and believed him.

## Time for Reflection: Fred

Steven Shanahan, Melbourme

Fifteen years ago, a man in his eighties travelled the east coast of Australia, sharing what he called Hodern Revealed Knowledge.

His name was Pred Robinson.

From the community which he established in Western Australia in the late sixties, Fred would travel with his wife Mary, some 3000 kilometers to the more populated cities of Australia's east coast, spreading his message in coffee shops, halls, universities and churches.

The cornerstone of Fred's philosophy was the “Brotherhood of Man”. Wherever people gathered to listen to this gentle man, they would invariably notice _the Urantia Book_ by his side.

People were attracted to Fred. He radiated sincerity and extended the hand of friendship to all. His appearance complemented his sagacious nature; long, white, shoulder-length hair, beard, serene smile and sparkling eyes.

Fred was an integral part of the “New Age” cultural movement in Australia during the late sixties and seventies. His philosophy and example of “practicalizing the spiritual and spiritualizing the commercial” attracted many hundreds of people to his talks and to the community in Western Australia.

Tours were not rigidly planned, they simply flowed. How unique it was to hear Fred speak in a bakery one evening, talking about “Limitless Love and Truth”, then, a day or two later, camping in the high country discussing the establishment of communities based on a simple, natural lifestyle.

The “Spirit of Brotherhood” shone brightly in Fred.

On the 11th of April, 1983, Fred peacefully passed on, ten days before his 92nd birthday.

_Footnote For French Readers:_

The “Universal Brotherhood” has grown over the years to become one of Australia's most successful communities.

The postal address of the community is: Universal Brotherhood P.0. Box 21, Balingup, W.A. 6253, Australia.

## Thought For The Month

It is literally true, “Human things must be known in order to be loved, but divine things must be loved in order to be known”. (<a id="a147_128"></a>[UB 102:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p1_1))

When Iris Eckersley rang one of the 6-0-6 team last month and suggested to include the beautiful quotation from _the Urantia Book_ on p. 383B about the Spirit of Truth in the March issue of our Newsletter, we were only too happy to oblige.

Not all of us feel confident enough to pick up our pen and write an article, but if you come across a quotation, that you find particularly inspiring, jot it down on a piece of paper, send it to 6-0-6 and we will share it with our readers around the globe in our new section : THOUGHT FOR THE MONTH

## The Home At Nazareth

> “THE home of Joseph and Mary was a one-room stone structure with a flat roof and an adjoining building for housing the animals. The furniture consisted of a low stone table, earthenware and stone dishes and pots, a loom, a lampstand, several small stools, and mats for sleeping on the stone floor. In the back yard, near the animal annex, was the shelter which covered the oven and the mill, one to grind and another to feed the grain. As a small boy Jesus often fed grain to this mill while his mother turned the grinder.” (<a id="a155_527"></a>[UB 122:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6_2))
