## Editorial

In October this year Sydney will host the national conference and plane are on the way for — South Pacific conference in October 1988.

It is perhaps a good idea to discuss the subject of conferences, and in particular the Pacific Conference, more openly through the Newsletter. Up till now conferences in Australia have been relatively small. We never had more than 40 people attending. But now we are looking at the possibility that our oversea visitors will outnumber us. That is fine. But have we got the resources, manpower and accommodation to cope with this? When people spend so much to come to Australia, surely they will want to stay a little longer than just the two or three days of the conference. They will want to 888 more of our country and our people.

In a meeting last October which was held in Melbourne and which was attended by about 15 people, it was discussed that other states apart from N.S.W should host our overseas guests. But we will have to coordinate this properly.

As we look to the future we are asking ourselves if big conferences are what we went and need. Does Australia want to take the direction of the U.S., where conferences are becoming so big that they need committees to advise other committees? Let's be honest. At this stage we haven't got the manpower to do it. Sydney's study group has about 4 or 5 people in it. If we invite overseas guests, we would like to give them the time and attention they deserve. Over the past years several URANTIA Book readers from overseas came to Australia. They travelled around this vast country of ours, stayed with families and got to know and love the Aussies. Our doors are always open, but perhaps it would be better if they spread their visits out a little more instead of all coming to one conference. We don't need large groups of people to take action as was proven by the Perth Study Group. There are only a handful op students up there, but they sowed the seeds of this new revelation in the hearts of many people who walked by their Book Booth in January this year. We Aussies are just as good in making decisions around the barbecue as around the conference table. We are all for international fellowship, but let it start in our homes and with our families instead of around the conference table. People don't have to wait for a conference to come to the land down under. Our Aussie spirit of love and hospitality is alive today!

## “Thought for the month”

> “What a travesty upon the infinite character of God! this teaching that his fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of his creatures that his tender mercies were not forthcoming until he saw his blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Cavalry!”
> 
> “But the inhabitants of Urantia are to find deliverance from these ancient errors and pagan superstitions respecting the nature of the Universal father. The revelation of the truth about God is appearing, and the human race is destined to know the Universal father in all that beauty of character and loveliness of attributes so magnificently portrayed by the Creator Son who sojourned on Urantia as the Son of Man and the Son of God.” (The URANTIA BOOK <a id="a54_456"></a>[UB 4:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_6))

## The First Australian Urantia Book Booth

(Australia Day Weekend, 1987)

This event was a historical precedent for _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia and for our dedicated group of readers in Perth.

The Matilda Festival is a yearly occurrence in Perth, and is known for its cultural, spiritual and educational displays. One can expect to see interesting display booths by: The Baha'i faith, The Summit Lighthouse, The Right To Life Association, Hare Krishna and Dianetics — with free personality tests. _The URANTIA Book_ booth was nestled within these groups and sects, and yet it was obvious that we weren't the blue and white club, presenting yet another sect to the world. We appeared as an information booth, and as participants, we were united in our efforts to give _The URANTIA Book_ public exposure. This was a national effort on the part of the URANTIA movement, as we, the Perth study Group, were ably helped by Kathleen and Trevor Swadling of Sydney and Steven Shanahan of Melbourne.

Over 300 pamphlets were taken by interested passersby, many who engaged in discussions with us on the nature and origin of the book.

The greatest thing which emerged from the booth experience was that of group identity. Dur once private study group was exposed to public attention. and we were very well received. There also developed an excellent camaraderie between us and the other participating booths; which reminded me a bit of Cymboyton's school of religions at Urmia.

The Urmia religionists lived together in comparative peace and tranquility because they had fully surrendered all their notions of religious sovereignty. Spiritually, they all believed in a sovereign God; socially, full and unchallengeable authority rested in their presiding head — Cymboyton. They well knew what would happen to any teacher who assumed to lord it over his fellow teachers. “There can be no lasting religious peace on Urantia until all religious groups freely surrender all their notions of divine favour, chosen people, and religious sovereignty. Only when God the Father becomes supreme, will men become religious brothers and live together in religious peace on earth.” (<a id="a68_691"></a>[UB 134:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_10))

I recommend all study groups throughout Australia to organize an URANTIA book booth. It is a great service to the community, not only to let them know that you are a believer in _The URANTIA Book_, but to sow seeds that will eventually enrich and enlighten all humanity.

Peter Toy, Perth

## The Question of Astrology

Looking forward to an enjoyable and thought provoking newsletter in the now year. Would love to hear about others' news and experiences regarding Astrology and Reincarnation in the light of _The URANTIA book_'s understandings on these subjects. They have particularly been a question mark for me as I have been impressed by the accuracy of Astrology in my own personal experience and also with reading of other people's experiences of reincarnation. Thank you for all those involved in putting out the Six-0-Six Newsletter.

Stephen Theiler, Melbourne

At the time we received this letter, we were fortunate enough to have an URANTIA Book reader from British Columbia, Canada staying at 6-0-6 headquarters. Mark Blackham was so kind to answer Stephen's letter speaking from his own personal experience.

Dear Stephen,

It was a pleasure to read your recent letter to the 6-0-6 newsletter. I am writing in reply to your question regarding astrology as viewed in the light of _The URANTIA Book_. I can only reply from my own experience and my heart and sincerely hope I have been of service to you.

As a onetime ardent student of astrology for a number of years, I too found many of the interpretations of the positions and juxtapositions of the stars and planets to ring true in my personal experiences and feelings. At times many of the predictions and analysis of character appeared uncanny. I sincerely felt and hoped that I had finally discovered a means of explaining many things I could not understand about myself and others. And yet, as much as I studied the subject, it could not completely dispel my yearning for truth. Still an empty hole persisted in my heart. An astrological analysis of events, myself and others could not fill this vacancy of truth which pleaded to be occupied. Something was missing.

It was around this time that I tripped over the greatest discovery of my life, _The URANTIA Book_. Upon reading the book for the first time, I too was not only amazed and thrilled at its message, but like yourself, was a little disappointed and confused as I read sections of the book which shattered many beliefs and concepts I had previously held. Nevertheless the messages of _The URANTIA Book_ began to fill to overflowing that vacant hole in my heart. Messages such as — There is a God — He does love me — I am one of His sons — it is a friendly universe — He wants me to join Him. These concepts and this kind of knowledge far exceeded any truth I had previously encountered in any study of any thing.

My new understanding of God and the universe led me to become aware that such a God of fatherly love would not so cruelly peg the changing character and fate of one of His sons to the positions of the stars and planets. _The URANTIA Book_ taught me, and I now believe wholeheartedly, that Jesus is a Creator son of cod. And one of Jesus' admonitions to us all was ‘Be you perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect’. Although we may never achieve perfection on this world, it must certainly be possible in the worlds to come. Otherwise Jesus would not have given us such a seemingly impossible mission. And, if such is the case then we are truly free of the fetters of astrology which bind us to a particular type of character, to certain circumscribed abilities and limits of achievement. We are truly free! Our only guide is His Spirit and His endless love, perfection our potential goal.

I can only advise you to read on Stephen, feel the Spirit within, prepare yourself for a transformation beyond your imagination.

## When Was Michael's Crucifixion Date?

It is sometimes interesting to see how close Science is getting to the truth. Take for instance the debate about the correct date of the crucifixion.

Colin J. Humphreys and W.G. Waddington of Oxford University in England have come to the conclusion that it must have been on Friday, April 3, A.0.33. If you know your URANTIA Book dates, you might say: “But that is wrong.”

I know, but if you follow their reasoning, you will see how close to the truth they came.

This is how they have calculated the date of the crucifixion:

Most Christians would agree that Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate. His procuratorship in Judea lasted from A.D. 26 to 36. John states in his Gospel that it was before the Passover festival, that is Nisan 14 in the Hebrew Calendar. The synoptics (Matthew, Mark and Luke) indicate the first day of Passover, Nisan 15. None of the Gospels numbers the year according to any of the counting methods then in use. So the next step is to determine in which of those years Nisan 14 or 15 fell on Friday. This means more than simply looking up the calendar. Jewish months begin at the new moon. The new moon is by definition invisible, and in those days they couldn't calculate the lunar cycle as easily as they can now. They had to determine the first of the month by observing the first tiny sliver of the crescent and count from there.

## Land Of The Morning Calm

In this article Robert Reno tells us of his experiences as an army chaplain in South Korea.

Because of its length we had the unenviable task of deciding whether to bring it to you in greatly abridged form or to publish it in its entirety, but in two or more parts. Since the 6-0-6 is now published only bi-monthly, we felt we had to settle for two parts.

PART 1.

**Internationalism And The Urantia Book And Outreach Ministry In South Korea**

By Robert Reno

Dedicated to Meredith Sprunger and Clyde Bedell

There are two individuals who have by far made the profoundest impression upon my life, with it's increasingly growing desire to somehow serve the revelation. I consider them to be pioneering leaders within the movement, and a source of inspiration for many, including myself. I am sure that I am not alone when I express this, so if I may say this for the many, we are deeply grateful and appreciative for your inspirational leadership and examples Although I believe it goes unsaid, these two individuals, are Clyde Bedell and Meredith Sprunger. It is to them, that I would like to dedicate my efforts here in South Korea, for their inspirational outreach ministries and their selfless spirit of evangelism.

My last year and a half here in South Korea, has largely been an experiment in outreach ministry carried out under very difficult conditions due to the Army's severe demands on my time and energies. It has proven to me though, that the potential for some form of intentional, evangelistic outreach ministry is a very needed and viable endeavour, capable of bearing many fruitful readers of _The URANTIA Book_ on the international and world-wide level.

## Excerpt From Letter 11, Summer 1986

During the "International encounter" at the Montvillargenne Castle, we had the opportunity to live with great intensity, moments of deep, sincere and unforgettable brotherhood. Relationships transcended the material and intellectual levels and were established as deep as the soul level.

We lived not as students and teachers, but only as individuals in search of other individuals in order to understand and love each other. Everyone was so different, but still gathered together with a common denominator: the consciousness of being children of a unique and loving Father and the desire to live this sonship and the consequent brotherhood which follows. Each person added their own unique contribution, always acting with sincerity.

In fact it was easy for us to live like this. The participants, some of which had travelled very far, brought an extraordinary will to know, learn and share. The morning prayer/meditation brought our souls closer together. We were like seeds in a pod, protected and huddled the one against the others.“Spiritual growth is mutually stimulated by intimate association with other religionists. Love supplies the soil for religious growth...” (<a id="a205_440"></a>[UB 100:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p0_2)) Each one of us, as we returned back home, felt a full, a yearning to prolong this state of grace. For most of us, after this warm bath of brotherhood, we will go back and submerge ourselves in the cold waters of everyday life and find ourselves in our ordinary social surroundings.

What we have been able to realize between us, why not try to realize it around us? It behooves each of us, in our own everyday surroundings, to enter into this process. Open wide the seed pods and spread the leaven of love around us. If we are conscious of being the loved daughters and sons of the Universal Father of love, then we are conscious that all men and women are our brothers and sisters, not only those who read _The URANTIA book_.
