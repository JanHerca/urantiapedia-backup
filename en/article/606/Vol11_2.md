## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The salvation of God for the mortals of Urantia would have been just as effective and unerringly certain if Jesus had not been put to death by the cruel hands of ignorant mortals. If the Master had been favorably received by the mortals of earth and had departed from Urantia by the voluntary relinquishment of his life in the flesh, the fact of the love of God and the mercy of the Son — the fact of sonship with God — would have in no wise been affected. You mortals are the sons of God, and only one thing is required to make such a truth factual in your personal experience, and that is your spirit-born faith.” _The URANTIA Book_ <a id="a72_638"></a>[UB 186:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_9)

## New Zealand Readers' Weekend Meeting

</figure>

Last year some of the readers in New Zealand got together for a weekend meeting, a first for most of us here, and a very valuable experience. We met at Neville and Trish Twist's house in Auckland, on the 14th and 15th October 1989, and comprised the Auckland study group plus Susan and Colin Hermingsen from Wellington. A group of readers from Hamilton had been invited, but were unable to make it this time.

The meeting started with a presentation by Mark McEwan, who gave us a very concise overview of life according to _The URANTIA Book_ from an individual point of view, describing all the myriad spiritual influences on each of us and how it all interacts, complete with diagrams. This was followed by a very thought-provoking presentation from Neville dealing with apparent inconsistencies in the Book regarding seraphic velocities.

We spent the afternoon reading the paper on Christianity's Problem, which generated much discussion, as we all come from varying religious backgrounds, and have quite different viewpoints.

The day was rounded off by listening to some of the Sadler tapes, which we have acquired thanks to Trevor and Kathleen Swadling, and which I for one find utterly fascinating, coming as they do from the very beginnings of _The URANTIA Book_. Most of the group then indulged in a meal from the local Indian takeaway place, which by all accounts turned into quite a test of one's tolerance for high spice levels!

On Sunday morning we were just discussing what paper to read, when two visitors arrived, and at their request we read from 'Government On A Neighbouring Planet', and some quite intriguing ideas came forth on how parts of this paper could be applied to modern day Urantia. Our visitors were quite new to the Book, but were also keen to promote their own particular interests, and turned the discussion to astral travel and channeling. I would like to share this with other readers, as I think it happens quite a lot, and we as a group have discussed it several times before, i.e. the appropriate way of relating to people who express an interest in the Book but see it as one of many sources of truth and wisdom, and who investigate everything. In _The URANTIA Book_ we are encouraged to find out about other religions and to take the best from them all, but do we do this in the context of a study group or is it best done individually? We would welcome any comment on this.

Our meeting progressed through Sunday lunch, followed by a short discussion on multi-cultural and multi-lingual aspects, and winding up with a general agreement that the weekend had been very successful and we must do it again soon! Hopefully next time we will be joined by the group in Hamilton, and really start to sow the seeds of a New Zealand URANTIA Book fraternity.

## The Purpose Of The 5th Epochal Revelation

Is It The Recruitment of Genuine Apostles?

What is the specific purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation on this planet? While this may seem obvious to very many readers of _The URANTIA Book_, to others who are familiar with the finest concepts and teachings of Christianity as well as the best in several other of the world's religions and philosophies, the answer is not so obvious. Excepting for detailed information on the hierarchical structure among the heavenly hosts that we have no means of verifying, much of the Book's content has been stated elsewhere. Neither do the scientific aspects of the Book bring much new knowledge and certainly little that we were not due to discover independently within a short time after the Book's publication.

Perhaps the simplest conclusion is that it has been given to us in order that we should recognize our sonship with the Father and the brotherhood of all men. But that message is not new, so is there some other purpose for this revelation? Undoubtedly part of its purpose is to rectify error that has partially negated the effectiveness of the 4th Epochal Revelation. Another purpose would be to amplify upon our knowledge of our place in the totality of God's creation. But why has this new revelation cone to us specifically at this time, and not 1000 years hence or whence?

## Relief Associated With Being A Urantia Book Reader

“Know the truth and the truth will set you free”.

What a wondrous relief to know that we are living in a loving universe of order. And for myself to discover that I have been running around like an idiot looking for those things which are, in reality, ever present with me.

To name but a few:

1. A master — I need seek no master. For eternity, I have a Master, someone to lead me and that someone is Michael the way, the truth, and the light. In Michael we have a beautiful loving Creator Son who knows exactly the planet on which we live and what it feels like to live as a mortal and as we stumble our way up to Paradise, we know he is either “dragging” us or “pushing” us at times — forever our master and leader.

## We Too Can “Phone Home”

Why should E.T. be the only one to phone home across the light-years of the universe? We would probably be staggered by the amount of his phone bill. E.T.'s advanced technical knowledge enabled him to construct a cosmic telephone out of the odds and ends he found around his host's house. That requires quite a bit of ingenuity, but fortunately, we do not have to have the advanced capability to construct such an interplanetary communications system. If we ever try to communicate cosmically, we discover to our delight that to call the Designer of the entire universe conversational apparatus, the phone we need is already installed and ready for use. There is no installation charge, no need for repair with normal use, and no activation fee. Even the expense of the receiver and sender is abrogated by the prior preparation of the Master Communications Executive. Just as we discovered that we have the vocal apparatus to converse with as a child, so is it revealed to us that a far more intricate and critically designed cosmic phone system is already at our disposal.

Just as a caring and loving parent is delighted to receive a phone call from a son or daughter whom they have not heard from recently, so does the Phone designer likewise eagerly await our calls. When we see the flashing red light on our mechanical phone answering machine, we pick up the receiver and discover that the Phone Fashioner has already left a message of love and truth to start off our use of the cosmic phone. The Fashioner has left his number and the area code of astronomic region of his phone which is used on the initial phone home experience. It seems to be up to the client as to whether he will return a response to the message recorded on his call-receiving machine. After the phoner chooses to answer the call, utilizing the priorly prepared phone system, it is no longer necessary to employ either the phone number nor area code. Thereafter, the phoner needs only pick up the receiver and the Designer is already on the line waiting to receive his calls.

## Farewell Dear Henry

On January 3rd, this year, Henry Begemann said his final farewell to Urantia. Henry, who resided in The Netherlands, was a leading figure in the URANTIA movement in Europe.

He worked on the Dutch translation of _The URANTIA Book_ for, many years as leader of a team of three, and the greater part has been finished. It will be continued by the other members now that Henry has been promoted to the mansion worlds.

He was also the driving force behind the birth of the French newsletter “La Lettre” in 1978, to establish a link between French readers. At about the same time the C.E.R.D.H. was founded (Center of Study and Reflection on Human Destiny) which Henry was also involved with.

In August 1982, while he was a Field Representative (for Europe) of the URANTIA Brotherhood, Henry decided to have corrections made to the French translation of Jacques Weiss. That's why he put three readers in touch with each other who did not know each other before, a bilingual person from Brussels, Belgium, an English teacher from Avignon and a third person from Paris. Henry worked with this team for a year to start them on their way. This correction came to an end in July 1989. Printing now depends on the Foundation.

In Holland he was the leader of six study groups, and members have now started their own groups.

In England also, Henry gave encouragement to readers and a few groups are now meeting regularly.

In Sept/Oct 1986 Six-0-Six published his article ‘Springtime’, which first appeared in ‘La Lettre’, Summer 1985. It was a study on what _The URANTIA Book_ has to say about the relatively near future. Henry called it ‘Springtime’ because of Jesus' words on UB 176:2.6

> “But you should be wise regarding the ripening of an age; you should be alert to discern the sign of the times. You know when the fig tree shows its tender branches and puts forth its leaves that summer is near. Likewise, when the world has passed through the long winter of material-mindedness and you discern the coming of the spiritual springtime of a new dispensation, should you know that the summertime of a new visitation draws near.” <a id="a173_444"></a>[UB 176:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_6)

Henry's final sentence in that article was:

“Be of good cheer, it is springtime already.”

He will be sadly missed by the many people who loved and respected him.

## In Remembrance Of Henry Begemann

When we lived in Holland Wolgang and 1 had the privilege of meeting Henry Begemann and being regular members of his first, very special study group.

Special, mainly because of Henry, whose enthusiasm and driving force to come to grips with the immensity of _The URANTIA Book_, was an inspiration to us, and to all who met him.

He saw his main task in translating the Book into Dutch to make it accessible for a large number of people, which cause he furthered, later in a team, to almost completion.

We feel blessed to know him and we wish him a thrilling journey on his path inward.
