Announcement

June 1, 1990 AD

Dear Friends,

Those of you who have done your homework and diligently studied the FIFTH EPOCHAL REVELATION to the evolving races of your planet will better understand and grasp the significance of the following announcement. For those of you who have not done your homework and studied _The URANTIA Book_ I will briefly explain the announcement to you.

It is important to understand the following activities of Machiventa, one of the twelve Melchizedek Receivers who came here to “secure” the planet at the time of the Luciferian Rebellion. (Actually, these Receivers were here twice as they left upon the arrival of Adam and Eve and returned at the time of the Adamic default.)

MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK, YOUR NEW PLANETARY PRINCE.

When MICHAEL OF NEBADON incarnated here as Jesus, he did of course accomplish many things. One thing he did was to confront Caligastia, the then Planetary Prince, and remove him from his position as Spiritual Ruler of this Planet, the spiritual name of which is URANTIA. Caligastia is who many believe to be “SATAN” or the “DEVIL” but this is not so (by name at least) as BOTH Lucifer AND Satan were removed from their System Stations to a Prison World. Caligastia, however, though shorn of his powers, was allowed to remain on the Planet.

> “_Upon Michael's becoming the settled head of the universe of Nebadon, Lucifer was taken into custody by the agents of the Uversa Ancients of Days and has since been a prisoner of satellite number one of the Father's group of the transition spheres of Jerusem._” (<a id="a50_266"></a>[UB 53:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_2))

> “_Satan was allowed to make periodic visits to the apostate princes on the fallen worlds until another Son of God should be accepted by such apostate worlds, or until such time as the courts of Uversa should begin the adjudication of the case of Gabriel vs. Lucifer._” (<a id="a52_272"></a>[UB 53:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_3))

> “_It is true that Satan did periodically visit Caligastia and others of the fallen princes right up to the time of the presentation of these revelations [the URANTIA REVELATIONS], when there occurred the first hearing of Gabriel's plea for the annihilation of the archrebels. Satan is now unqualifiedly detained on the Jerusem prison worlds._” (<a id="a54_347"></a>[UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4))

After the Rebellion took place, the Melchizedek Receivers worked principally with and through Van, an associate of Caligastia who remained loyal to Michael, and Amadon, his human counterpart. These two remained on the planet and taught truth for over 150,000 years until the arrival of Adam and Eve.

In 1973 BC there occurred the THIRD EPOCHAL REVELATION to the people of your Planet. (The FIRST epochal revelation was the arrival of Caligastia; the SECOND was Adam and Eve; the THIRD **Machiventa Melchizedek** the FOURTH Michael/Jesus and the FIFTH IS THE URANTIA BOOK). Machiventa incarnated “in the likeness of human flesh” as a full grown male and was here 94 years earth time. He did not age and left as suddenly as he appeared. This time he worked DIRECTLY with ABRAHAM, the “Father of the Jews”. Abraham, now an Ascended Master, is working through a Human Agent at the present time on your planet.

> “_This same Melchizedek continued to collaborate throughout the nineteen succeeding centuries with the many prophets and seers, thus endeavouring to keep alive the truths of [his] Salem [teachings] until the fullness of the time for Michael's [Jesus'] appearance on earth._” (<a id="a60_278"></a>[UB 93:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_4))

> “_Machiventa continued as a planetary receiver up to the times of the triumph of Michael [Jesus] on Urantia. Subsequently, he was attached to the Urantia service on Jerusem [the System Capital] as one of the four and twenty directors, only just recently having been elevated to the position of personal ambassador on Jerusem of the Creator Son, bearing the title VICEGERENT PLANETARY PRINCE OF URANTIA. It is our belief that, as long as Urantia remains an inhabited planet, Machiventa Melchizedek will not be fully returned to the duties of his order of sonship but will remain, speaking in the terms of time, forever a planetary minister representing Christ Michael [Jesus]. 
> 
> As his was an emergency bestowal on Urantia, it does not appear from the records what Machiventa's future may be. It may develop that the Melchizedek corps of Nebadon have sustained the permanent loss of one of their number. Recent rulings handed down from the Most Highs of Edentia, and later confirmed by the Ancients of Days of Uversa, strongly suggest that this bestowal Melchizedek is destined to take the place of the fallen Planetary Prince, Caligastia. If our conjectures in this respect are correct, it is altogether possible that Machiventa Melchizedek may again appear in person on Urantia and in some modified manner resume the role of the dethroned Planetary Prince ..._” (<a id="a64_688"></a>[UB 93:10.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_5))

> “_We well understand how, by his triumph on Urantia, Michael became the successor of both Caligastia and Adam; how he became the planetary Prince of Peace and the second Adam._” (<a id="a66_181"></a>[UB 93:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_7))

> “_It has long been the opinion of our order that Machiventa's presence on the Jerusem corps of Urantia directors, the four and twenty counselors, [Lao-tse is also a member of this council] is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief that he is destined to follow the mortals of Urantia on through the universe scheme of progression and ascension even to the Paradise Corps of the Finality._” (<a id="a68_396"></a>[UB 93:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_9))

> “_Less than a thousand years ago this same Machiventa Melchizedek, the onetime sage of Salem, was invisibly present on Urantia for a period of one hundred years, acting as resident governor general of the planet ..._” (<a id="a70_221"></a>[UB 93:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_10))

The second time these twelve Receivers were here some of them worked directly through “HUMAN AGENTS” or “MATERIAL COMPLIMENTS”, humans who were conscious of this arrangement (which was the sixth century BC) and among these humans was Lao-tse. Lao-tse was in such a state of consciousness he could dematerialize his body and allow MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK to appear and share this vehicle with him. Machiventa being the Melchizedek who honoured Lao-tse in this way.

As previously mentioned, it has been thought by many that since Machiventa was Vicegerent Planetary Prince that sooner or later he would be elevated to the position of Planetary Prince.

In December, 1989 AD, MACHIVENTA APPEARED through Sananda's Light Body and announced that since the new Spiritual Planetary Government had been assigned he had, indeed, become the new Spiritual Ruler of your Planet, appointed by Michael/Jesus, Creator of your Universe of Nebadon. He also announced that since Lao-tse had been his Material Agent before and since Lao-tse is the Ascended Master who has been using the Light Body of Sananda and APPEARING/MANIFESTING through him for almost a quarter of a century in this life cycle, both he, Machiventa and Lao-tse, will be working through Sananda on a multidimensional basis. In a recent session with Lao-tse, the FUSION of Lao-tse's Light Body with Sananda's Light Body was witnessed which means a PROCESS has been completed after many years (and lifetimes) of initiations to the point where Sananda becomes invisible and Laotse's Light Body manifests through the shared vehicle.

Therefore, the JOYFUL ANNOUNCEMENT is that you have a new PLANETARY PRINCE, MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK, as well as an Ambassador, Sananda Lao-tse Melchizedek, through which both he and the Ascended Master Lao-tse will VISIBLY function on the rapidly increasing frequency of the Earth Planet Urantia.

(For further information on the above refer to _The URANTIA Book_ and “THE LIGHT BODY” tape by Sananda explaining the process by which an Ascended Master may APPEAR through a human “channel”.)
