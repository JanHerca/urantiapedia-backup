## Editor's Notebook

### 97,98,99 ...

Welcome to our first issue for 1992, our thirteenth year of publication ... and ... the ninety-ninth issue of Six-O-Six.

Now is the opportunity to put pen to paper and send your pearls of wisdom, good wishes, or general comments, for our next very special edition — number one hundred.

We would like to present a selection of reader responses from around the world. So let's hear from you and be a part of our history and our celebration.

### Our Challenge

Information exchange and technology continues to set political, social, and industry agendas, interconnecting our global village.

Major political ideologies and new trading blocs are being synthesized into social development.

The irony is that the forces inherent in change from information are not under the direct control of any political or business leaders.

Our pursuit of knowledge reflects on our culture, the philosophies of scientists, and creativity in art, music and literature.

Into this context, _The URANTIA Book_ must take its place. The more effectively and professionally it can be presented, the more concilliatory will be its public perception.

Individuals and URANTIA Book organizations will continue through 1992 to address the challenge of how best to allocate resources so that modern technology can enhance the scope of opportunities for people to become aware of the book and its teachings.

### Crossroads?

How optimistic dare we be for the future of the URANTIA Brotherhood Association?

While it will receive widespread and independent advice on its role and structure, the proof will be in its implementation and administration. We have to be optimistic. What other opportunity for progress looms on the horizon?

While progress may take time, all eyes will be focused on the early initiatives of this organization and the relationship the URANTIA Foundation may choose to impose upon it. Does the Foundation realize the support it will receive for creating a fair and representative association? Does the Foundation understand the urgency for such an association? Does the Foundation see that, if they fail to win the court case, such an organization will be more important than ever?

## So They Say

**Now Sclentist**

Pressure is growing for international safety standards for nuclear reactors. Such a move would make the expansion of nuclear power more acceptable politically and to the public. It would also make it easier to license new designs of reactor.

**World Review**

Recourse to the United Nations is usually a final attempt to manage a problem that individual governments have found insoluble. The growing majority of non-Western countries tend to use the UN as a platform for the advocacy of causes instead of as a forum for negotiating compromises and promotion of solutions.

**Time Magazine**

The Eclipse — July 11, 1991

Studies showed that the sun is bigger than previously thought. Looking at invisible wavelengths that represent hydrogen emissions, the sun's chromosphere, or lower atmosphere, extends 6000 ~km beyond what is normally visible. Measurements suggested that the atmosphere is hotter and denser than had been thought.

**21 — C Magazine**

We are moving rapidly from an industrial era in which material values of growth, status, and production were dominant, into an era where people's psychological and spiritual growth will become more important.

## Letters To The Editor

### International Conference 1993

_By William Wentworth Area Co-Ordinator — Australia_

Preliminary information about The Fellowship for Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ 1993 International Conference is now becoming available. The Conference will be held from the 31st July to 5th August in St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, near Montreal, Canada.

The Conference theme is to be “Touch the World”, and it appears as if there will be a strong emphasis on outreach. As St. Hyacinthe is in the French-speaking part of Canada, the conference will be fully bi-lingual, Canadians being very experienced in this type of function.

The Fellowship is the successor to the Fifth Epochal Fellowship which grew out of the URANTIA Brotherhood following its split from the URANTIA Foundation. It is far and away the largest organization of URANTIA Book readers in the world, and includes 18 of the 21 former URANTIA Brotherhood Societies which had been affiliated with the URANTIA Brotherhood. This organization, under its successive names, holds an international conference every three years, the last one in Colorado in 1990 attracting over one thousand readers to a superbly organized program of information sharing, specialist presentations, socializing and entertainment. The 1993 Conference is the first of these triennial conferences to be held outside the U.S.A., and it will therefore be an important milestone in the Fellowship's progress.

The Canadian organizers are very enthusiastic, and are sure to produce a memorable program. All readers are welcome, so note the date and start saving! For further information contact:

Conference Chairman, Brent St. Denis
1088 Barwell Ave., Ottawa, Ontario K2B 8H5
Canada. Phone (613) 828-1685

### Scientific Unity

_By David Cook, Jan Juc, Victoria_

There are many cultures and their associated religious teachings. If truth is discernible, should not their extra-dimensional science, if they have any, be taken seriously also? For example, the knowledge that there are seven heavens all about the globe we call Earth or Urantia, is widespread among the seers of history.

## News Around The World

### Tenth Printing Completed

The tenth printing of _The URANTIA Book_, consisting of 25,000 copies, brought the total number of books in print since 1955 , to 235,000 .

_Le Livre d'URANTIA_ has completed its fifth printing with a print run of 6,000 copies.

Dust jacket designs for each have been altered to include a wider range of book references.

### Price Increase Inevitable

The URANTIA Foundation, after a decade of maintaining the price of _The URANTIA Book_, is now reviewing its pricing policy and a price rise is inevitable.

Even with a reasonable increase it would still be considerably less expensive than publications of similar size and quality.

### Thick With Lawyers!

Brisbane Sunday Mail, December 8, 1991

The U.S., with 5 percent of the world's population, has 70 percent of the world's lawyers.

That means that American lawyers, just to stay in business, must expand their fields of operations to cover previously benign activities.

So, will Congress step in to halt this madness? No way. 42 percent of the House of Representitives and 62 percent of the Senators are lawyers.

### Advisory Committee Appointed

The Trustees will confer with readers in a more definite way to plan for the future. Seven readers are members of an Advisory Committee to the Trustees (ACT) for the Friends of the URANTIA Foundation and the URANTIA Brotherhood Association.

ACT will primarily serve as a sounding board and a resource on ideas on how to proceed in a practical way with the efforts of Friends of URANTIA Foundation and the implementation of URANTIA Brotherhood Association. ACT will function in an advisory capacity to the trustees for all of 1992 , and have its own operating methods.

The advisory body is not meant to be a political body. To insulate them from political pressure, ACT members will preserve the confidentiality of their deliberations and communications with the Trustees, but they will develop and pass along to them any helpful ideas they may receive from others.

The presentation of _The URANTIA Book_ is an evolutionary process and human wisdom must evolve. It is expected the members of ACT will bring a tested experience which will further the social and fraternal aspects of efforts to disseminate the teachings.

### Calling All Truthists!

Dave Strang is interested in hearing from people who may wish to receive his publication, Now Highlights for Truthists.

In particular, he would like greater contact with readers in New Zealand and Australia.

For further information, write to Dave at: 

_The Jesusonian's Study Group Fellowship,_
_2326 Hecker Av., Rockford, Il. 61103, U.S.A._

### Correct Posture

Book reader, Carl Sarelius, considers proper body posture is very important during meditation. As a result he designed and built a meditation stool for which a patent is pending.

Anyone wanting further information can write to SixO$-Six and we will forward your request on to Carl.

## Articles

### Is Copyright Really Necessary?

_by The Sunshine Coast Study Group_

That _The URANTIA Book_ is still being offered in its virtually original form, we give thanks to the URANTIA Foundation. But times change and we are forced to ask:

**1. Can a person really own a divine revelation?**

Common sense says that the answer to that question is no. Certainly the first four epochal revelations belonged to mankind as a whole. Is it likely that our celestial supervisors would order that the Fifth Epochal Revelation should be owned by a self-nominated, self-perpetuating board of trustees? The book states:

### To Make Fair Evaluations

_by Madeline Noordzy, Perth_

The last four words in Connie Lester's letter to the September/October 1991 issue of Six-O-Six, “...to make fair evaluations.” prompted me to study _The URANTIA Book_ a little more in regards to the claims made by Gabriel of Sedona as to ‘repersonalizations.’ says:

On UB 114:7.13 a mysterious paragraph in brackets

> “_(The cosmic reserve corps of universe-conscious citizens on Urantia now numbers over one thousand mortals whose insight of cosmic citizenship far transcends the sphere of their terrestrial abode, but I am forbidden to reveal the real nature of the function of this unique group of living human beings.)_” <a id="a227_309"></a>[UB 114:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_13)

### The Parable Of The Sower

_By Dave Cook, Jan Juc, Victoria_

Imagine you are one of the people on the shore listening to Jesus of whom you have heard favourable reports. He is sitting in the boat speaking words of life. You are seeking truth. You are not there out of idle curiosity with nothing better to do, nor are you there to contend with him as some obviously are.

You hear the first words of a parable he has begun to speak in answer to someone's dejected plea about the woes of life.

“Imagine a sower going out to sow.” You have yourself done much sowing, being as you are, a farmer. You listen on. You see the footpath and the pigeons feeding on the grain that has spilt there. You warm to the story thus far told, for it is a familiar picture, part of everyday life with its ups and downs, its hardship and its humour, good times and bad. You do not begrudge the birds getting their fill on grain that would otherwise be trodden under foot to rot. You listen on.

## “Before The Cock Crows...”

_by Ann Bendall, Sunshine Coast, Brisbane_

Peter loved Jesus so much, how could he have done this? As a child reading the bible, I was so relieved that Jesus knew that Peter was going to deny him three times before the cock crowed on the morn of his crucifixion. I knew that Jesus was capable of foretelling the future and assumed it was because his Father told him. The motive of our Father in revealing Peter's forthcoming denial, I deduced, was to lessen the disappointment of His beloved Son.

I had all of that sorted out in my mind and arrived at the conclusion that Peter was frightened and a bit of a coward. What a pleasure to be given insight into the functioning of Peter's mind!

## The Book — Study And Discussion

### Should The Original Text Have Been Altered?

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

We have been led to believe that, following the completion of the plates for the first printing of _The URANTIA Book_, orders were given for the original URANTIA Papers to be destroyed. Hence the text for that first printing is the most authentic one now available, and is the text that future translators and scholars will need for their work.

The number of corrections made since the first printing is in excess of one hundred. Apparently some changes were made to correct the grammatical errors of the revelators. Then there are a number of textual changes that appear to have been made in attempt to correct what were perceived as errors made by the revelators.

## The Forum

### Do We Have Any Idea? It's A Debatable Point

_By Max Harris, South Australia_

How I miss it, the power and thrust of ideological debate; good minds propounding ideas and better minds demolishing them.

How important to our social destiny the clashing and concord of minds can be, especially when the weapons of wit, irony, ratiocination, analogy and common logic have led to thoughtful sense winning out over silliness.

It is not an age of great debates and involving controversies. The Blaineys and the Keneallys and the Santamarias still give it a go, but they know they are merely shadow boxing.

By and large competitive ideas are expressed as a form of minor field sport, played before a mass audience of television viewers of the kind that are habitually plugged into the commercial networks. The jargon of politicians, journos and saloon bar screamers says it all.

## On Reflection

### Keep The Faith

_By Lee Lester, Saratosa, Florida_

We greatly enjoyed the recent celebration of the Master's birth on our planetary home. Although we couldn't gather together in one place as we are scattered from one end of the planet to the other, the brotherhood of faith sons were united in spirit if not in locality. The newsletters after the event seemed like the echo of the same note — “This was definitely the best yet.” We in Sarasota, Florida, USA, like many others, observed the remembrance of Michael's planetary bestowal. Our's was a joyous occasion, commemorating the life Jesus lived among his fellows and the faith he had for their faith in his Father. Our thoughts were turned back like pages in time to the evening when Jesus established the remembrance with his mortal associates so long ago.

The twelve arrived at the upper chamber before the Master. They noticed pitchers of water, the basins, and towels for washing their dusty feet, but no servant had been provided to render this service. The apostles began to think to themselves, each one refusing in his own heart to act as a servant to the others.

### When all is said and done..

> “Jesus' usual technique of social contact was to draw people out and into talking with him by asking them questions. The interview would usually begin by his asking them questions and end by their asking him questions. He was equally adept in teaching by either asking or answering questions. As a rule, to those he taught the most, he said the least.” (<a id="a372_356"></a>[UB 132:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_2))
