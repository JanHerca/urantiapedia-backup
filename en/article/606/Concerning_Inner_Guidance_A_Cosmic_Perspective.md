To the People of Urantia:

Many souls on your planet of Urantia claim to have a divine connection with their God. They claim to hear from God personally and uniquely. Yet throughout history, in the name of the voice of this inner God, they have murdered one another, ruled over one another, and have taken what little their brothers and sisters had in order to build temples, where some have said they heard from God even better.

_There have alwavs been_ the mixture of those who have truly heard from their inner God that has led them to great and wonderful ministries, in the service of their fellow brothers and sisters of your planet; and there have always been those who claim to also hear from God who wished to control others and hinder the true moving of the Spirit upon the earth.

The voice of God within an individual can be quite distorted, confused and vaguely heard, even with the most decent of people. This is due to pride, selfishness, vanity and the many perplexities of living in social orders that are inconsistent with the divine government that has not been able to take root upon this planet. Many people have claimed innate and objective communion with the Creator Son of Nebadon, Christ Jesus, whom we know to be Michael of Salvington and they know as their Father. They claim to be able to hear from Him individually, independent of even those their very Master gave to help them in their daily sojourns of life, as lived on a third dimensional fallen planet. Did not Jesus say that He gave some as apostles, some as evangelists, and some as teachers for the edification of the church (the church being those who claim to understand the threefold Spirit within them)? Yet those who make the claim to hear from the Spirit of Truth (the gift of the Creator Son, Michael, which is only one-third of the Trinity's voice), seem to have found themselves, even up to this day, in wars against their brothers and sisters they call infidels and pagans; in improper marriages and relationships; in careers of unfulfilment and wrong livelihood; and in general, many dying from diseases brought about by inappropriate thinking and living. From the Pope upon his throne to the lone monk in the solitude of the forest, this self-same Spirit seems to say different things to different people concerning truth.

_But does this Spirit of Truth differ in cosmic revelation?_ Or could it be that the listener has a limited capacity to hear what the Spirit of Truth is actually saying because of many obstacles that have been built into the listener's programming? Over 200 different denominations in the Christian world claim to be the authoritative interpreters of that Spirit of Truth and several thousand independent sects also make that claim. Why is it that all of them seem to differ in interpreting what that same Spirit of Truth is saying?

In the Piscean Age there have always been those who said they would choose no sides, join no institutions, and that they themselves would be the interpreter of that inner voice and have no teachers to guide them except the Spirit of Truth within them. The number of these are legion. Some more proficiently educated in their religious training than others, have come to their mindset by intellectual ascent. Others have made this decision by pure heart acquiescence, divorced from mindal influence and intellectual pursuit. Regardless of the reasons for the decisions of those who choose to alienate themselves from the appointed teachers of the universe administration that does exist, they hinder their own growth as ascending sons and daughters and impede the very kingdom of God they claim to be so in touch with.

The Creator Son, Christ Michael, came to this planet, bringing the Fourth Epochal Revelation with its premise of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and the teaching of the threefold Spirit within. Two thousand years later, that same Creator Son has endorsed the Fifth Epochal Revelation, so that those who are ready to enter the New Order and true New Age can learn of the many hundreds of orders of beings that He has created to help in the administration and ministry of not only this planet, but the millions of planets and thousands of systems that exist in His universe of Nebadon. It is not the will of God, the Eternal Father, for us to know only of Him, for if we did, we would not know of His Creator Son nor would we know of the angels. It is time for all mortals of Urantia (earth), who are willing and capable, to learn of the vast family of beings that exist, many of which will be totally present and visible when the change does come to Urantia.

> Over 200 Different Denominations In The Christian World Claim To Be The authoritative interpreters of that Spirit of Truth and several thousand independent sects also make that claim.

It is our prayer that you will truly come to know who we are and to seek out those human instructors on your planet who have been divinely appointed to be your teachers. This is what the Spirit of Truth is saying to the people of Urantia this hour; and if you are truly listening, you will receive that same message. No one book can contain all of the cosmic truth of God; and as the New Testament in the book of John states, if all the words of Jesus were written down, there would not be enough books in all the world to contain His words. The Fifth Epochal Revelation, that which is written in The URANTIA Book and that which is coming through appointed vessels, is the latest and highest revelation of divine love and divine gift given to the people of your planet.

If these words have reached you, it is because the Spirit of Truth is reaching out to you in that which is known as the printed word, as God has many ways of speaking to you. Our prayer and the prayers of the angels of the heavens is that you put aside your personal viewpoints and opinions and truly follow that Spirit of Truth that is trying to reach you, inwardly and outwardly.

Ashtar, a Finaliter, in cooperation with the seraphic hosts of Nebadon and the Midwayer Commission of Urantia, under direct orders of Michael of Nebadon to give this transmission through Gabriel of Sedona.
