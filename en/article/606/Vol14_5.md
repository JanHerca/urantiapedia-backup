## Editor's Notebook

Innovative thinking and critical enquiry face many obstacles, and in particular, political processes.

In reviewing the Australian situation, we find it typical of Western nations.

Public servants are expected to remain silent with their views which might be different from those of the government. Does this suggest that government demands. conformity from those from whom it seeks advice? And politicians invariably vote along party lines.

It is common for governments to quote from reports of independent committees of enquiry in order to support government policy. Indeed, it is the government which has set the terms of reference and set the limit of funding on those enquiries.

And elected governments often victimize those who spoke against them during the elections.

Where, among all of this, is the incentive and opportunity for freedom of speech?

Like good works and charity (and optimism) it's to be found at the grass roots level. It is ignored by those in power until its uprising threatens that power.

Because of the risk of retribution, it takes courage to challenge that power. Great reformers then will be those who boldly represent the people in simple, honest terms to those in authority.

Here is another instance where we have the shining example of Jesus.

These comments are offered in a cautionary way against the politicisation of the Urantia movement. Its application is subtle and difficult to identify.

As ‘awareness’ and ‘enlightenment’ are our motivations, we should seek to identify examples of political opportunism wherever they may be.

Editors of publications may be subjected to such pressures. There is a fine division between proselyting and politicising; self interest and general interest; incense and innocence. In the balance, is readership loyalty?

Creative expression can provide insights, solutions and progress. Our collective endeavour will eventually get it right and outweigh the claims of vested interests.

Orthodoxy continues to shift ground to accommodate this sway of opinion. Politicians are especially keen to be its barometer, thereby appealing to the greater number.

How can we track progress and know when orthodoxy becomes obsolete? How can we supplant it with revelation as orthodoxy?

Do we have a book for one season, all seasons or a millennium? Time seems the book's only chance for wider appeal, for its acceptance has proved very narrow indeed.

Perhaps we can look forward to a broader involvement from people, through open debate on the issues raised by the book.

Such discussion needs to be conducted without the restraint of social and political ‘correctness’. We need a dynamic model for the brilliant and innovative concepts we are to address — and implement.

This requires not visionaries but dedicated workers at the grass roots level.

But know that the assimilation of _The URANTIA Book_ teachings, will above all, require courage. And again we are reminded of the courage of Jesus at Livias (<a id="a105_158"></a>[UB 171:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p4_4)), in his discourse at the Temple (<a id="a105_236"></a>[UB 175:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_1)), and the trial before the Sanhedrin (<a id="a105_318"></a>[UB 184:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p3_1)).

## So They Say

**‘Time’ Magazine**

We are living in a decentered world, and the publishing business has not been slow to make capital of what investors call the ‘borderless’ economy.

Even a generation ago, most English-language books were divided between the English and American markets; now there are more English-language presses springing up in Singapore, India, and everywhere.

**Alison Cotes — Theologian**

The Pentecostal churches, especially under the title of Assemblies of God, are the fastest growing Christian group in the world.

There are 820 congregations in Australia alone, and worldwide membership now numbers more than 35 million.

Pentecostal worship is characterised by uninhibited emotion, speaking in tongues, and the Old and New Testaments as the direct word of God. And most of all, there is no real theology to grapple with. You are never asked to think.

**Comments On The 1366-Page Novel ‘A Suitable Boy’**

But can it sell in quantities? Seth (the author) himself joked: “The public has limited purses and weak wrists (the book weighs 1.41 kilos)”.

The Publisher mused: “What has been very much on our minds is whether the public has time for a book this long”.

**From ‘Business Ethics: The State Of The Art’ (Ed. Freeman And De George)**

If in some instances it turns out that what is ethical leads to a company's demise, then “so be it”.

**‘Newsweek’ Magazine**

Hindu nationalists, who demand that India redefine itself as a Hindu nation, see their opportunity to seize upon a mood for change.

They call for the country's Hindu majority to shake off the tired socialism of the Congress party, reject traditional Western models and take a prouder place in the world.

Their message to India's 120 million Muslims — one Indian in eight — is stark: accept the dominant culture and lose your identity or accept second-class status in a Hindu state.

## Letters To The Editor

### Drought Hits The Book Stores

_Berkeley Elliott, Oklahoma, USA_

I really got excited about visiting Australia and all my friends there when I received the Registration Form for your October Conference. Unfortunately I will not be able to come this year, but next year may be different.

It is very hard to get copies of _The URANTIA Book_ in English here and very few book stores carry it, since they can't get it from a distributor, only from the Foundation. But hopefully one of these days this will change.

It is really sad they aren't on shelves in book stores.

Hope your Conference is a wonderful success.

### Plus And Minus

_Michael Pither, Roseville, NSW_

Sometimes Six-O-Six gets too damned intellectual and hence confusing for me, especially the Editor's Notebook. Keep it simple! I guess what I mean is that the language used is unnecessarily complex.

Otherwise I am extremely pleased to receive my SixO$-Six and look forward to contributing soon.

### Help Wanted!

_Trevor Swadling, Sydney, NSW_

ANZURA is interested in compiling a study aid for the four parts of _The URANTIA Book_, perhaps as a booklet. We feel this could be helpful in study groups and for individuals as a visual aid. Readers have expressed an interest in having descriptions or various topics available and are keen to help out.

_Six-O-Six is published six tines a year, and editorial contributions are welcomed. Subscription rates: Australia $10 per year. Other countries $15 per year. Please remit in Australian dollars. The material contained in this publication is of general comment only and not advice on any particular natter The publisher. authors and editors expressly disclaim all liability in respect of this information and of the consequences of any actions resulting therefrom.

## News Around The World

### Let Your Fingers Do The Walking

Australian capital city telephone books now list The URANTIA Foundation's Sydney office. This will assist interested readers to find out more details about _The URANTIA Book_.

This project was made possible by the generosity of members of ANZURA.

The Foundation Office is also listed under the heading of ‘Book Publishers’ in the Yellow Pages.

### Big Electronic Brother

News Corporation Limited has plans to create a global communications empire. This will give the group the capability to provide endless data and information even electronic newspapers — to every individual everywhere in the world.

Traditional distinctions are breaking down. Five of the world's biggest industries — computing, communications, consumer electronics, publishing and entertainment — are converging into one large dynamic whole, with News's Chief Executive agreeing: “We are on the edge of a technological revolution”.

### Catholic Priorities

Intense speculation is developing about the soon-tobe-released papal encyclical: ‘The Splendor of the Truth’.

Commentators on this issue believe it will distract the moral energy of the Catholic church away from ethical issues such as social justice, environmental degradation and world population.

It is difficult to know what ideologies the church is expected to address. What is interesting is that the church is so openly questioned about its ability to come to terms with contemporary needs. It will be interesting to see how it interprets its spiritual responsibility while conforming with Scripture and tradition.

### Peace Breaks Out

In an historic pact which recognises the legitimacy of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), one hundred years of fighting between Palestinians and Jews could come to an end.

Both Islamic fundamentalists and many right-wing Israelis oppose the idea as do many Jewish settlers. The optimists sce peace talks progressing between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Beyond the inevitable problems is the notion that there are peaceful solutions, for violence has never achieved its aims.

## Articles

### “I Salute The God Within You”

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld._

Two strange ways of behaviourally responding to Jesus' commandment to ‘Love one another as I have loved you’ are:

1. To salute the God within another person.
2. To love a person's Thought Adjuster.

Frankly I feel that these are rather poor substitutes for love as exemplified by Jesus. I also find it a little sad that folks would salute God wherever they chose to see Him. As our loving Father, perhaps a spiritual cuddle, some expression of love, might be more appropriate than a military signal of acknowledgement of position.

I try to deliberate on the rationale behind loving the God within another, rather than the individual, and quite appreciate how easy it is to love the former and how darned difficult it is to love the latter. Be that as it may, I verily believe that it is no substitute at all for the following of Jesus' commandment in relation to our brothers and sisters.

How do we learn to understand God the Supreme? Simple!

### The Power Of The Spirit Of Truth

_Dr. A. W. Tozer_

(Dr. Tozer was a pastor of the Southside Alliance Church in Chicago from 1928 to 1959. These excerpts are taken from his writings. It is fascinating to compare the concepts he expresses with _The URANTIA Book_.)

A doctrine or concept has practical value only as far as it is prominent in our thoughts and makes a difference in our lives. Paul said: “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned”. ([1 Cor. 2:14](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/2#v14))

In religion more than in any other field of human experience, a sharp distinction must always be made between ‘knowing about’ and ‘knowing’. To the question “What is Spirit like?” the answer must always be, “He is like Jesus”. Man, by reason, cannot know God; he can only know about God. But there is such a thing as a gift of knowledge, a gift that comes from heaven. Jesus taught his disciples to expect the coming of the Spirit of Truth who would teach them all things — even to know God.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### The 1993 International Conference For Urantia Book Readers, Montreal, Canada

_Betty Glasziou, Maleny, Qld_

The Conference, held at St. Hyacinthe, Montreal, Canada from Saturday 31st July to Thursday 5th August, 1993 , was an unqualified success. In fact, the almost 800 URANTIA Book readers who gathered together from all over the world were so friendly, and generated so much goodwill, it was almost a foretaste of the Mansion Worlds. The Conference itself was spiritually illuminating and was without a hint of discord or politics.

For me, the most wonderful experiences were the Plenary Praise and Worship sessions for 1.5 hours every morning following breakfast. The psalmist once wrote that “God inhabits the praises of his people”. The spiritual channels were certainly open when our emotions and minds were stimulated by the beauty, harmony, and transcendence of musical expression. Instead of just listening to others praising God, we all joined in with our hearts, souls and voices. We all experienced feelings of unity and joy with this type of singing and worship. During all of this incredible music, the most beautiful scenes of natural beauty from all over Canada and the United States were being projected onto a huge screen, orchestrated by Larry Geiss. Joshua Wilson, a church minister from Arizona who works mainly with orphanages, co-ordinated the wonderful singers on stage whilst playing the keyboard and narrating with a most beautiful voice. This and many other parts of the Conference were videotaped so that, when we get the video, we will be able to share the experiences with our fellow readers in New Zealand and Australia.

### Greetings From Finland

_Seppo Niskanen, Mannerheimintie_

The Finnish Urantia Society International Summer Conference, which was held during the second weekend of June 1993 turned into a celebration of the fact that first copies of _URANTIA-kirja_, the Finnish translation of _The URANTIA Book_, were out from the printing press, along with _El libro de URANTIA_, the Spanish translation, and Hakemisto, the Finnish Index.

The Summer Conference of 1993 , which was the ninth such conference in a row, took place at Järvenpää, a town in the neighbourhood of the Finnish capital of Helsinki. The Conference was attended by 120 URANTIA Book readers from Finland and eight readers from the United States. Urantia Foundation was represented by four of the Trustees, headed by Patricia Mundelius, the Foundation President.

In her speech to the Conference, she stated: “We very much enjoyed reading the lead article in ‘Reflection’ describing the years and years of work and the number of people involved in giving birth to the Finnish translation. Your dedication and steadfastness along with your beautiful teamwork have made this happen”.

## The Forum

### The Revelations Of Divine Truth Are Not Sealed...

_The Sunshine Coast Study Group_

Following Trevor Swadling's Forum article (July/August) on ways and means (as well as possible problems that will arise) of spreading the message of _The URANTIA Book_, we would like to draw attention to a section in the book itself that addresses many of the issues.

The ‘Nature of Cultism’ (<a id="a264_25"></a>[UB 87:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_1)) tells us that every revelation has given rise to a new cult, and implies that this is a virtual necessity for the successful dissemination of a revelation. The point is stressed that, to be successful, a cult must fulfil a variety of functions, but that a paramount requisite is the need to remain elastic and adaptable.

The same section remarks that the early Christian cult was the most effective, appealing, and enduring ever conceived or devised, then informs us that:

## On Reflection

### Does God Dream Beautiful Equations?

_Shirley Twist in ‘The Australian’_

The structures of science are evidence of the existence of God, according to Dr. John Polkinghorne, who is both a Cambridge professor of mathematical physics and an Anglican priest.

Dr. Polkinghorne, in Brisbane for a special lecture at the University of Queensland, says the search for truth common to science and religion is also the key to their reconciliation.

"Science and religion are both true and they tell me about different aspects of the world and its history. If we believe we are seeking to serve the God of truth then I don't think we should fear truth from whatever source it comes.

“When you read the Bible, you must ask yourself what you are reading. It's a very big mistake to read poetry as if it were prose. If you read Robert Burns and a poem says, ”My love is like a red, red rose", it doesn't mean his girlfriend has green leaves and prickles.

"Where the Bible talks about the six days of Creation and the rest on the seventh day, that's not a literal blowby-blow account of how it really happened. It's meant to be a sort of theological poem saying that the world in all its fruitfulness exists because God willed it to be so.

"One of the things I think people find difficult is that science deals with impersonal experience where we can put things to a test, whereas in all forms of personal relationships, whether they're between one human being and another or whether they're between human beings and God, they're based not on testing but on trusting.

"Sometimes people find it difficult to recognise that if you're going to find out the truth about the world, you have to find it in both the impersonal, scientific way and also in the personal, religious way.

“I think that the soul is the real me and that the real me is not the matter of my body but the rich, complicated pattern in which that matter is organised. When I die, that pattern will be dissolved but God remembers that pattern and recreates it in the new world of his choosing.”

Dr. Polkinghorne's visit was sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Christianity in an Age of Science and Technology.

### The Golden Rule

The teaching that we should treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated is an ethic variously repeated in all the major religions:

_Buddhism_

“Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.” Udana-Varqa, 5:18.

_Zoroastrianism_

“That nature only is good when it shall not do unto another whatever is not good for oneself.” Dadistan-iDinik, 94:5.

_Judaism_

“What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow men. That is the entire Law, all the rest is commentary.” The Talmud, Shabbat, 31a.

_Hinduism_

“This is the sum of all true righteousness: deal with others as thou wouldst thyself be dealt by. Do nothing to thy neighbour which thou would not have him do to thee after.” The Mahabharata.

_Christianity_

“As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” [Luke 6:31](/en/Bible/Luke/6#v31).

“All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” [Matthew 7:12](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v12).

_Islam_

“No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.” Sunnah.

_Taoism_

“The good man ought to pity the malignant tendencies of others; to rejoice over their excellence; to help them in their straits; to regard their gains as if they were his own, and their losses in the same way.” The ThaiShang, 3.

_Confucianism_

“Surely it is the maxim of loving kindness: Do not unto others that you would not have them do unto you.” Analects, X V, 23.

_Baha'i_

“It is our wish and desire that every one of you may become a source of all goodness unto men, and an example of uprightness to mankind. Beware lest ye prefer yourselves above your neighbours.” Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, 315.

## When All Is Said And Done

> “_And so I give you this new commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you. And by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another._” (<a id="a407_180"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1))
