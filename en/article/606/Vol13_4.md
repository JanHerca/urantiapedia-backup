## Editor's Notebook

It seems to me that the truly serious students of _The URANTIA Book_ are displaying exceptional tolerance towards those who are dabbling in the activity of channelling.

Call it what you will. Claim to have a contact personality in your group, get excited over the information received, then ponder your new position in the scheme of things.

But let's take a close look at the response to the practice.

Instead of seriously questioning it, are we soft-pedalling to appease some erstwhile friends? Because we think it might be true?

It's a sham, a misdirection of energies, a great disrespect to an epochal revelation. It contravenes all we are taught. To over-rule the book would claim to have access to a higher authority.

Which group, then, is laying claim to be the deliverer of the sixth epochal revelation? Already so soon! The fifth supposedly obsolete!

How many people are now ‘making the switch’ to this practice? They should realize that there are many others who continue to be part of a sane and sensible readership, who have staunchly chosen to ignore such bewildered souls.

Are any members of our URANTIA Book organizational groups prepared to speak up and say ‘yes, we are guided in our decision making by communicated information’? Give it credence and you give yourselves discredit. You would be surrendering your God-given free will and unswervingly heading for mediocrity.

You would be dependent on a single hurian intellect operating on a nonsensical subconscious, on whims, and on so called ‘impressions’. You will ignore the mood of nations, other groups and individuals. Ego-centric and circumspect, you will each reinforce your own insecurities, inadequacies, and irresponsibilities.

Don't even consider this phenomenon. Just ignore it and read the book. Channelers are merely attempting to recycle it. The more conversant the channeller with the book, the more impressive will be the teachings relayed.

Depend solely on your own spiritual worth. Dare to depend solely on Jesus' teachings, as spelt out in great detail in _The URANTIA Book_. Remember? Dare to challenge nonsensical information. Think carefully and independently.

We do not have the excuse of ignorance.

Recognize the symptoms. Inner group elitism, obsessive behaviour, indiscriminate use of funds, the spurning of once-dear friends, uncharacteristic behavioural outbursts, the chosen people syndrome, the save the world justification, irrational decision making, and controlled environments and attitudes. Controlled minds!

Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ quite deliberately and unequivocally discredit such performances? Who among us can substantiate this misguided practice of channelling from information presented in the fifth epochal revelation to this planet?

## So They Say

**Business Strategy International**

Now that everyone has awakened from the enterprise dream of the 80 's, a different executive style is being peddled for the new decade. 90 's leaders will need to be rounder human beings who are into personal growth, be genuine world citizens with cultural sensitivity, be able to live with adversity and ambiguity, generate momentum, and look to internal sources of self-esteem.

**The Weekend Australian**

Since the laws of physics — even those which govern unpredictable chaos — are written in formal mathematics, this sad fact leaves most of us bereft, deaf to the thunderous music of the expanding cosmos, blind to its truest hues and patterns, numb to the inner world's sensuous touch.

**P.P. McGuinness, Los Angeles**

The one fact that struck me powerfully, which I have not seen in any report, was the omnipresence of religion. In the main stretch of Vermont Avenue, roughly from 51st Street to 87th, I counted more than 100 different churches before I gave up. Most were just large and small store front operations.

**B.A. Santamaria**

There is a deep gulf between a sensible demand for measures calculated to maintain the biological health of soil, air, water and the re- emergence of the ancient pagan cult of pantheism, which the environmental cult is increasingly becoming. The impetus behind the new cult is the powerful political force mobilised by the various environmental advocacy movements, which in the US alone, have some 50,000 full-time employees.

## Letters To The Editor

### Introductory Readings From The Us

_David Glass, Fort Worth, Texas, USA_

“The Love of the Universal Father” is the transcript of a speech I gave at the recent Cedar Hill Conference (near Dallas) for Readers of _The URANTIA Book_, the theme of which was ‘Live in My Love’.

‘How Do We Get to Heaven?’ is an attempt to restate some of the knowledge and understanding we have received from the revelators on this subject. It is designed to provide readers with something to share with other people who do not intend to read the revelation. It is also useful to readers as a compilation of facts about the survival process which I hope will be helpful.

‘The Resurrection of My Soul’ is a poetic way of describing the resurrection experience. Except for a few words newly coined by the revelators, this poem can also be shared with non-readers.I hope these items will provide pleasurable reading and intuitive, spiritual insight.

### Paperback Edition?

_Keith Bacon, Frankston, Victoria_

1900 years ago, Jesus presented Urantia with his personal saving message and gospel, putting Michael's words to our Father's divine love.

Now this same master — Jesus — has re-presented his very same saving message to us in _The URANTIA Book_. This second attempt to present his matchless gospel should be available to all humanity through translation and printing. It needs to be presented, unencumbered by the rest of _The URANTIA Book_, in a free paperback in every language to all people with an advertised option to purchase the whole book after reading the Master's teachings in a gift from a mate.

### Invitation From Amsterdam

_John Blogg, Amsterdam, The Netherlands_

I am the caretaker of PO Box of _The URANTIA Book_ Readers of Amsterdam. It is good to hear from you so far away. I will certainly copy [Tony Rudd's] tape and send it to fellow brothers. I do write with readers in the USA now and then. I enjoyed your tape!

For a long time now I have been into synergy — Buckminster Fuller and dome building — and in May I leave for LaPalma, Canary Islands, to look for a site to build one. I hope to hear more from you or other Australian readers.

## News Around The World

### Bible Makes The Ratings

The BBC reports its serialization of the Bible is attracting 600,000 listeners a day. John Gielgud, who does an excellent job of narration, started with Genesis and there are plans for the Koran and possibly the Bhagavad Gita, the seminal work for Hindus.

### Expanded AASUB

AASUB is now The Australian and New Zealand United Readers Association (ANZURA).

An affiliation between book readers in Australia and New Zealand has been formed. This represents an expansion of the former AASUB of Australian readers.

ANZURA is a non-profit organization with a simple organizational structure.

The main objectives of the association are to support the steady spread of the revelation through undramatic, everyday means, by encouraging local, autonomous and informal URANTIA Book study groups. It maintains a readership network designed to facilitate contact between reachers if they wish. ANZURA also sponsors and supports an annual conference for students of _The URANTIA Book_ which is hosted by different study groups and held at different locations from year to year. A bulletin is published on a quarterly basis which keeps the membership up to date with the activities of the association. It also supports the aims and objectives of Urantia Foundation.

Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ are invited to enquire about membership in ANZURA. A copy of the constitution and an application for membership are available on request.

For further information or enquiries contact the secretary:

### Vatican Enters New Age

The Vatican has issued a lengthy statement on the media, Aetatis Novae (Of The New Age), which not only urges the church to take media communication seriously but goes so far as to urge that “education and training in communication should be an integral part of the formation of pastoral workers and priests”.

In getting wise to the media, bishops should even “seek the collaboration of professionals in secular media and of the church's own media-related organizations, including especially the international and national organizations for film, radio-television and the press”.The document goes on: “As the Spirit helped the prophets of old to see the divine plan in the signs of their times, so today The Spirit helps the church interpret the signs of our times and carry out its prophetic tasks, among which the study, evaluation, and right use of communications technology and the media...are now fundamental”.

The document suggests increased communications technology has been a ‘mixed blessing’ in that it is only of general benefit if based on “sound values and wise choices on the part of individuals, the private sector, governments and society as a whole”.

The Vatican says it does not seek to be an arbiter in such matters but believes it can assist in “indicating ethical and moral criteria which are relevant to the process, criteria which are to be found in both human and Christian values”

How long it will take for the Vatican's suggestions to be heeded in Australia might be interesting to observe.

### Vatican Defends Earth Summit Stance

_P. Pullella, Reuters, UPI_

The world's population does not need to be cut to solve ecological problems, the Vatican told the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

“Population growth is seldom the primary cause of environmental problems,” says a confidential memo on the summit, sent to Vatican diplomats around the world.

“There are no links between the numbers of people and degradation of the environment. The less populated nations of the north are responsible for most of the abuse of the environment.”

The stand comes after criticism of the Catholic ban on contraception and charges denied by the Vatican, that it tried to keep birth control off the summit agenda.

Development experts have argued that curbing population growth will help protect the environment.

The European Communities environmental commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, of Italy, said population growth was the biggest problem confronting the summit.

He said a survey showed it took 10,000 generations to produce a population of 2 billion but it would take only one generation to double the present population of 5.5 billion.

The United Nations contends that the world population will double by 2030 and industrial output will need to quintuple to meet its needs.

The Catholic Church bans all artificial birth control. The Vatican memo adds: “Systematic campaigns against birth, directed towards the poorest populations, may even lead to a tendency towards a form of racism. Programs for reducing populations, directed and financed by the developed nations of the north, easily become a substitute for justice and development in the developing nations of the south”.

## Articles

### Contemplative Prayer

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

We are given a great deal of information in _The URANTIA Book_ — suggestions, techniques, benefits etc., on the topic of prayer. It appears that there is a fine dividing line between prayer and worship and hence, in referring to Jesus — “The Master prayed very little for himself, although he engaged in much worship of the nature of understanding communion with his Paradise Father” (<a id="a208_385"></a>[UB 144:3.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p3_23)).

In giving his apostles instructions in response to their queries on prayer -“this all-important and worshipful practice” — he described prayer as “the sincere and longing look of the child to its spirit Father; it is a psychologic process of exchanging the human will for the divine will. Prayer is a part of the divine plan for making over that which is into that which ought to be” (<a id="a210_385"></a>[UB 144:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_9)). Now what does this mean? I read on and discover that “Practically all of Jesus' praying was done in the spirit and in the heart — silently” and that the “Master so rarely uttered his prayers as spoken words”. I get the impression that not only did he not utter the words, he did not pray mentally in words. I suspect that Jesus' praying was in the form encouraged by the Catholic religion called ‘contemplative prayer’. If my suspicion is correct, another cheer for Jesus Michael's Spirit of Truth as it has again broken through the traditional barriers of formalized religion by building on what was, so as to make it what it ought to be.

### Religious Publishing Bears Fruit

_By Anna Dollard_
_(Courtesy Of ‘Australian Bookseller \& Publisher’)_

Religious publishing in Australia is experiencing something of a boom. More and more readers are turning to religious titles and an increasing number of religious books are breaking through the specialist barrier and appearing in general book stores — not only in the religious section at the back of the shop. Browse through the biography, issues, belief and even teenage fiction categories of a general book store and you are more likely than ever before to turn up a religious title.

The breakthrough, say religious publishers, is a result of a greater openness in the community about religion and spirituality. “All the old idols have been shattered, and traditional beliefs turned upside down”, says Albatross Publishers Director John Waterhouse. “Paradoxically that has meant a greater openness to ideas and alternative ways of thinking”. John says the past 12 months have seen a significant growth in demand for original, Australian books on religion, with readers having at least wearied of what he describes as mediocre and bland titles which “rehash the same issues with little sparkle or originality”.

The growing demand for Australian over imported titles was repeated time and time again to $A B \& P$. Chris Pfeiffer, Marketing Manager at Lutheran Publishing House, says the latest bestseller list from the US covering religious titles made him feel “very sad”. “Apart from evergreens, C S Lewis' ‘Mere Christianity’ and Granger Westburg's ‘Good Grief’, the rest of the list is pretty listless. It's all pap”.

### Science And The Spirit

_By Bryan Appleyard,_
_Author Of ‘Understanding The Present: Science And the Soul of Modern Man’ (Picador, 1992)_

Here are the last lines of two recent books which have attempted to popularise the latest and weirdest developments in scientific thought.

The first: If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason — for then we should know the mind of God.

The second: We are truly meant to be here.

The first is the closing rhetorical flourish of Stephen Hawkin's super best-seller, ‘A Brief History of Time’. The second is the conclusion of Paul Davies's book, ‘The Mind of God’. Both men are physicists, and neither knows what he is talking about.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### Spreading The Message

_The URANTIA Book_ has instructed us about the importance of secondary works to get its basic teachings into general circulation (43:3). Even in western countries that have a literacy rate well above 90% of the population, surveys have indicated that less than one in ten adults ever read a serious book. Which surely means that _The URANTIA Book_ is unlikely to be widely read in the foreseeable future.

It seems a shame to have its wonderful teachings bottled up between its blue covers in unread form. What can we do about it?

For the immediate future some of us believe that there may be potential in wrapping up the teachings of the book into adventure stories and have commenced a project entitled ‘The Adventures of Jesus of Nazareth’, though we may change the name later. The idea is to write an exciting but ‘fictitious’ account of the life of Jesus which will nevertheless convey his teachings. As far as is possible every chapter will contain at least one ‘cliff hanger’ episode in the tradition of the old time western movie serials or the modern ‘soapies’. The approach is simple, you just get your characters into impossible situations then get them out again.

### God's Limitations

_by Neil Francey_

_Even God cannot alter the past. For that purpose,>  we have historians. And movies. And mythologies. And Walt Disney. History becomes national autobiography, and we know that of all literary forms, autobiography is the least reliable, the most inclined to flattery._
> 
> _Phillip Adams (columnist)_

How accurately are we charting the emergence of the fifth epochal revelation? Is it a stand alone document with nothing further to record?

The book places so much recognition on the individual, along with information to design the perfect self-development course that the group effort of our forebears and the expected public perception of the book's content, need not disturb the erstwhile student. The fact that the recordings of such activity may be erroneous lends further support to the idea that extraneous reports are irrelevant. Of historical interest only. Merely a diversion. For what can be authenticated?

### The Master

_condensed from _The URANTIA Book_ (1102/3)_

The Son of Man was always a well-poised personality. He was unafraid, surcharged with divine enthusiasm, but never fanatical. He was emotionally active, never flighty, imaginative, but always practical. He frankly faced the realities of life. He was always courageous, never reckless; prudent but never cowardly; sympathetic but not sentimental; unique but not eccentric; pious but not sanctimonious; well-poised and perfectly unified.

Jesus' originality was unstifled; he was not bound by tradition or conventionality though he taught with absolute authority. The most original of his teachings was the emphasis of love and mercy in the place of fear and sacrifice.

Jesus exhorted his followers to preach the gospel to all peoples, his sympathetic heart embraced all of mankind. Always his invitation was, “Whosoever will, let them come.” Jesus sublimely trusted the Father, even as a little child trusts his parents. No matter how cruel nature might appear to be or how indifferent to man's welfare on earth, Jesus never faltered in his faith. He was immune to disappointment, impervious to persecution, and untouched by apparent failure. He loved men as brothers. He went about doing good.

The Master was an unusually cheerful person, exhorting us always to “Be of good cheer.” He could maintain this attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and unshakable confidence in man. He loved mankind; he believed in us. He never grew weary of saying, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” He was frank, but always friendly, outspoken in his love for the sinner and in his hatred for sin.

Jesus was filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom and was unreservedly dedicated to “the Father's business.” This divine enthusiasm led the onlooking universe to appraise him as the model of sanity and the pattern of supreme mortal devotion to the high standards of spiritual living. And his controlled enthusiasm was contagious; his associates were constrained to share his divine optimism.

His courage was equalled only by his patience. He was never in a hurry, his composure was sublime. Though often indignant at evil and intolerant of sin, his indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.

Jesus was great because he was good, and yet he fraternized with the little children. He was gentle and unassuming in his personal life, yet was the perfected man of the universe. His associates called him Master unbidden.

Today, as in Galilee, he continues to enter the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it. It is literally true: “If any man has Christ Jesus within him, he is a new creature; old things are passing away; behold all things are becoming new.”

### When All Is Said And Done

> “_And it will not be so much by the words you speak but by the lives you live that men will know that you have been with me and have learned of the realities of the kingdom._” (<a id="a390_179"></a>[UB 140:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p1_7))
