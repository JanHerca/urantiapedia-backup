## Editor's Notebook

The communication agenda in the Urantia Movement is for mainstream readers only. This is domination by a minority interest, given total book sales. It is time to recognize the many classifications of readers and to consider their particular needs.

Just for starters:

- The earnest and communicating reader
- The 'spin off reader who is looking for a way to use the information
- The home-based and private reader
- The friend of a reader
- Those who are going to read it ‘one day’
- Those who've heard about it

The list could go on. Readers don't need to follow any program, gravitate to any one place, be it study group or city, and their pace and level of interest is entirely their own.

We experience the book. Like the modern working career, life changes course, prosperity is made and lost, status is strictly temporary, and we never retire.

So too, there is no certainty that someone hears about the book, traverses various stages of readership, to finally join the ‘professional circuit’.

It is not a matter of finding readers, it is all a matter of making friends and finding needs. What the book has given to us, and made of us, we can apply in general counselling, not recruiting. Maybe it is through such methods that, today, closet readers abound. Or do they?

We can endeavour to identify the spiritual interest of our friends and offer values. Hand them their independence. Fragmentation will continue. As individuals however, we will eventually seek an overriding ethic in society. One greater than our particular interest group.

The teachings, filtered through time and societies, are unlikely to be that moral imperative. It could be _The URANTIA Book_ per se — the revelation to the planet.

For structures tumble and no-one can be quarantined from change.

Behavioral theories and certain tics — neither stand the test of time. A cerebral world is replacing the mechanical.

But values, and our offspring, shall endure. As will our many categories of students continuing to study the blue ‘rule’ book, the one bastion that will retain its innocence. Reality will eventually catch up with it.

And perhaps this is the best way to provide for the diversity of readership through the course of this sagacious dispensation. Maintain, as long as possible, the innocence of _The URANTIA Book_. Allow for the spontaneity of discovery, and the personal and personality identification it ushers with great gusts of energy.

Spontaneity neither awaits or demands a formula of URANTIA Book introduction or readership style.

But the book itself, the gift of the gods, is imperative. But the book is on trial! And even worse than that, so are its contents! The rewriting is underway. An avalanche of half-truths, half-baked, half-inched. Choice, the modern god of consumerism.

What then of giving attention to the needs of the Unknown Reader, and less to our own. Perhaps their chosen status is its own reward. A perspective of enduring innocence, distributing values to family and friends.

So is _The URANTIA Book_ readership truly known and truly appreciated for its contribution to the advent of light and life? It would seem to be both undervalued and overvalued!!

## So They Say

**Lee Kuan Yew — On Good Government**

Whilst democracy and human rights are worthwhile ideas, we should be clear that the real objective is good government. That should be the test for official government aid. Is this a good government that deserves aid? Is it honest and effective? Does it look after its people? Is there an orderly stable society where people are being cducated and trained to lead a productive life?

**David Gelman — ‘Newsweek’ Magazine**

Ordinary people, many of them favored with sound intelligence and higher education, are recruited at a point in their lives when the summons to some larger collective purpose seems just the antidote to their alienation. Cult leaders know an outside threat increases the cohesion of the group. They foster a them-and-us mentality: members are the chosen ones, their mission transcendent. Many present themselves with special trunk lines to God.

**H. Mcqueen — ‘Weekend Australian’**

Perfect-fit adaptation and purposeful evolution are as anti-Darwinian as the creationism of the fundamentalist Christians. Darwin's good news is that human physiology works well enough to keep our species going, but some time in the near future — say in 250,000 years — homo sapiens will have evolved into something else or become extinct.

**Father James Murray — Anglican Priest**

Millennialism thrives in times of conflict and upheaval, but faces another problem. The year 2000 is confined to those countries and cultures following the Christian West. The Buddhist, Jewish, and Muslim calendars offer quite different years. In any case the Gregorian calendar is almost certainly skew-whiff by four or six or seven years, which makes 2000 inaccurate.

**Fred Hoyle — ‘The Intelligent Universe’ (M. Joseph, London, 1983)**

... the Earth is a fine garden which had its soil initially well-prepared to receive the seeds from which terrestrial life has evolved.

It is precisely because of...control by intelligence...that life on the Earth inherited such a comparatively placid and favourable home for its development.

I expect astronomers will eventually discover that much of what they currently believe concerning the behaviour and formation of galaxies has to be modified to take account of intelligent control.

## Letters To The Editor

### Articles Welcomed

_First Urantia Study Group, Auckland, New Zealand_

We really like the current editorship and format, as far as we're concerned you can be too tolerant of widely divergent views. We like articles to do with _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings. Keep up the good work!

### Top Channel

_Francois Dupont, Bruxelles, Belgium_

I love Six-O-Six and I like its content. I especially appreciated your ideas about channelling, I fully share them! Is not _The URANTIA Book_ the biggest, the highest, the deepest, the most complete ‘channelling’ work on this planet? All other channellings aside, are to be considered in function of (in relation to?) _The URANTIA Book_. Our inner conviction, guided by the Spirit of Truth, is the only individual tester and arbiter. Best wishes and compliments for your Six-O-Six newsletter.

### A Message From Sedona

Now I live in another country, have a new name and am editor of a new publication, which I am very excited about. Please accept this issue of The Salvington Circuit as my gift and that of my cosmic family to you. It has some great reading in it, my personal story about how I happen to be here is also included. Hoping to hear from you soon.

## News Around The World

### Congress On Family Law And Human Rights

In July, the First World Congress on Family Law and Human Rights will be held in Sydney.

This congress sees the family as the vital human unit, and extends the definition of family beyond parents and children.

The contemporary assault on the family, and especially children, is due in part to the increasing coalescence of cultures and the denial of human rights.

The congress will consider The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations report that abuses of children including slavery, sale, and sexual exploitation, are universal.

### Anniversary Of Chinese Presbyterian Church

With its origins in the Australian goldrushes of the 1850s, the Chinese Presbyterian Church recently commemorated 100 years of ministry. The Church government has survived on an orthodoxy based on scriptures, faith, and integration into its community.

### New Journal Published

The ‘Salvington Circuit’ is a bi-monthly publication claiming to be part of the Continuing Fifth Epochal Revelation to awaken Cosmic and other Urantian reservists as to the adjudication by the Bright and Morning Star versus Lucifer which the publishers believe is being implemented now on Urantia by the present Planetary Prince, Machiventa Melchizedek and his staff.

### Australlans Are Religlous!

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals there are as many as eighty identifiable religious bodies now represented in this country.

## Understanding Unbelief

ABC's Radio National has begun a series — Understanding Unbelief. “It will seek to find a replacement for faith. Atheism has been a bit of a fizzer”, quotes the program organizer.

### International Fellowship Committee Report

_John Lange, International Fellowship_

The International Fellowship Committee made a trip to Mexico City, March 18-22, 1993. We were hosted by Javier de la Garza and his reader community. We made a presentation and had several group discussions. They are all excited about the Spanish translation to be published soon. Readers in Finland will be hosting ‘Summer Days’, June 11-13, 1993. This will probably be held in the Helsinki area. Joel Rehnstrom expressed to me the desire of the group to have many attendants from other countries. With the anticipated publication of the Finnish translation, this should be quite a joyous occasion.

The International 1993 Conference for readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is in the final planning stage. It will be held July 31 — August 5, 1993 in St. Hyacinthe near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The theme is ‘Touch the World’, and we will focus on our international reader community. The opening ceremony will be a narrative of the Urantia movement in the world today. If you or someone you know has an interesting picture or story on this subject, please send it to me, or Sue Tenant.

As I have now visited several different cultures with URANTIA Book readers, I have found the Urantia Teachings not to replace but to be an outgrowth of more traditional religious beliefs. Thus the Urantia Teachings give us a fabric of common experience joining us in a family of great religious diversity.

### Big Bang — Big Fizz?

_Ken Crosswell, New Scientist_

Astronomers in the US and Britain believe they have discovered what may be the two most distant galaxy ‘superclusters’, vast chains of galaxies that stretch across tens of millions of light years. At 10 billion light years from earth, they would have existed just 2 billion years after the big bang. Their presence could completely destroy that theory which is already in trouble.

## Articles

### The Key To Loving Service

_Irene Borutta, Melbourne_

With great interest I have been following the ongoing legal wrangles between the Urantia Foundation and Kristen Maaherra. As often happens in prolonged disputes, both sides are polarising, creating more division instead of coming any nearer to a solution.

What purpose does this whole situation serve? The gradual breakdown of the cohesion of the Urantia movement. This would seriously effect the beautiful truth this book proclaims. Religious experience is only valid as a living experience, a knowing of God as our Universal Father and a knowing of God in our divine self as in all our brothers and sisters. With this realisation, Jesus is our greatest inspiration of a God-conscious life, lived with total dedication and devotion in unbroken communion with the heavenly Father.

As we partake of his life as he lived it on earth, as we ponder his teachings and try to integrate them in our own lives, the closer we get to him.

By opening our hearts and listening to his words we see many present day situations in a new light.

### Responsibility

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

A review of a recent university study on ‘lying’ claimed to show that we all tell lies and about 93 percent of us tell at least one ‘whopper’ per week. I presume that all URANTIA Book readers make up part of the remaining 7 percent!

Why do human beings lie so much? I once heard a child psychologist explaining that our reward and punishment system for the training of our children is a marvelous way to teach children to lie. Harking back to my own childhood, I recall that if we chose to lie it had to be water-tight, since the consequences of being caught for lying were far worse than admitting to the felony. I recall too that my dear old mum could hand out a mean whipping for lying — for which I belatedly thank her. In those days the 9th commandment came over as, “It's a sin to tell a lie” — and there was even a popular song having that as both title and main theme. It must have been effective training, for almost 70 years later, I can still remember every deliberate lie I ever told. And that's no lie.

There are many kinds of liars in this world, some despicable like the ‘con artists’ who get their kicks from acts like cheating the feeble minded out of their life savings. Then there are those who seem to get away with it, such as politicians or the likeable rogue who is quick to confess with a cheery word and a mischievous grin when confronted with exposure.

### More On Caligastia

_Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

I would like to make a few observations concerning the current tendency for some readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to accuse or imply that some people are being influenced by Caligastia. Perhaps we may find some clues from _The URANTIA Book_ itself. A couple of characters who come to mind from _The URANTIA Book_ who one would expect to be candidates for being influenced by Caligastia, are Judas and some of the members of the Sanhedrin. What does the book say about them in relation to this? On UB 179:2.3 We read:

> “_He [Jesus] fully realised that this traitorous betrayal was the work of Judas, but it also pleased Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia._” <a id="a246_137"></a>[UB 179:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_3)

## The Book Study And Discussion

### A Further Statistical Investigation Of Writing Styles In _The Urantia Book_

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

A previous study on this subject was published in the March/April 1992 issue of Six-O-Six. The study was undertaken because of speculation that _The URANTIA Book_ may have been written by a single author. Some that have been suggested are: Dr. W. Sadler, Lena Sadler, Bill Sadler, Wilfred Kellogg, Carl Jung, H.G. Wells, and Robert Millikin.

Many forms of style analysis have been used in attempts to identify authors of various documents and literary works. The advent of computers has enabled investigators to use increasingly sophisticated methods to collect and analyze data. Much of the modern work has its roots in methods pioneered by Mosteller and associates. Included among these procedures is the fre. quency of use by individual authors of ‘marker’ words that begin sentences or join clauses and phrases within sen tences.

In the previous investigation, the frequency of use of marker words at the commencement of sentences was used in a broad-based investigation. For example, the first analysis simply compared Part 4 with the remainder of the book, it being expected that there could be differences in style between the authors for Part 4 (earthbound midwayers) and the authors of remainder of the book (celestial beings). A global test using six marker words indicated multiple authorship at a probability level of one part in more than 30,000 . The results of a survey indicated that there are not less than four authors of The URANTIA Papers, and perhaps nine or many more.

## The Forum

### What Might Have Been?

_Tom Mulhall, Melbourne_

Jesus continued to teach the twenty four, saying:

> “_The heathen are not without excuse when they rage at us. Because their outlook is small and narrow, they are able to concentrate their energies enthusiastically. Their goal is near and more or less visible; wherefore do they strive with valiant and effective execution. You who have professed entrance into the kingdom of heaven are altogether too vacillating and indefinite in your teaching conduct. The heathen strike directly for their objectives; you are guilty of too much chronic yearning. If you desire to enter the kingdom, why do you not take it by spiritual assault even as the heathen take a city they lay siege to? You are hardly worthy of the kingdom when your service consists so largely in an attitude of regretting the past, whining over the present, and vainly hoping for the future. Why do the heathen rage? Because they know not the truth. Why do you languish in your futile yearning? Because you obey not the truth. Cease your useless yearning and go forth bravely doing that which concerns the establishment of the kingdom._” (<a id="a294_1052"></a>[UB 155:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_3))

Although largely a matter of history now, _The URANTIA Book_ was published in 1955 by The Urantia Foundation in Chicago. Since that time over thirty major works by theologians, philosophers, psychologists and laypeople have appeared on our shelves related to the book. The Urantia movement, which grew principally from the book itself, has given rise to a bourgeoning Church, numerous centres for theology and philosophy around the globe, social reform programs too numerous to mention and has been called “...the only new religion this century to truly grasp the minds of modern peoples”.

_The URANTIA Book_ became a noticeable item carly in the 1960s. The outstanding feature of the book was its apparently effortless ability to inspire the minds of people from almost every walk of life and persuasion. What should have been on the surface, like so many other things of its kind, an obscure esoteric oddity, became readily appealing to business people, professionals, teachers, tradespeople as well as the rebellious youth of that age. The book seemed to have something for everyone and although conversation and dispute was much varied, and often hot, the ‘Revelation’ of _The URANTIA Book_ provided a framework that brought a new way of viewing the age-old Christian message and also a new way of seeing society's potential. It gave an enormous variety of people a unified goal which seemed to transcend social prejudices. By 1970 the term ‘Urantian’ was commonplace.

By the early 70s, the groundwork was being laid that would provide for the movement's continued growth and influence. Small churches were formed in many major cities around the world and the Christian churches began to take notice. Urantian centres of every kind provided the opportunity for people to meet and exchange ideas.

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia" alt="sprinkler">
<img src="/image/article/606/sprinkler.jpg">
<figcaption>Maybe installing a sprinkler system wasn't such a good idea</figcaption>
</figure>

The book's great appeal was the modernity of its timeless spiritual message. People everywhere began to see the relevance of the age-old Christian message to a rapidly changing and technological environment.

With the healthy economic climate of the 70 s, social justice issues came to the fore and many notable politicians paid more than a fleeting interest to _The URANTIA Book_. In the business world, the concept of the ‘service motive’ overcoming the ‘profit motive’ took hold in the minds of many of the wealthy. Outreach work, often funded by major companies, began in the form of private Community Centres, Youth Centres, even Centres for Social Equality and Justice which sprang from the soil of the spiritual movement.

By the mid to late 70s it seemed that _The URANTIA Book_ was here to stay. Many people, disillusioned with mainstream Christianity, embraced the teachings while many Christians themselves, certainly at grass-roots level became more and more sympathetic with the message.

## On Reflection

### The Lord is My Pacesetter...

_Oswald Astor_

The Lord is my pacesetter. I shall not rush.
He makes me stop and rest for quiet intervals.
He provides me with images of stillness which 
restore my serenity.
He leads me in ways of efficiency through 
calmness of mind.
His guidance is peace.
Even though I have a great many things to 
accomplish each day, I will not fret.
For His presence is here, His timelessness, His all 
importance will keep me in balance.
He prepares refreshment and renewal in the midst 
of my activity by anointing my mind with the oils 
of tranquility.
My cup of joyous energy overflows.
Such harmony and effectiveness shall be the fruits 
of my hours.
For I shall walk in the peace of the Lord and t
dwell in His House forever.

### From ‘New Age Understanding’

_Donald Curtis (Unity Books, Missouri, USA)_

What is grace? Grace has been defined as the impersonal outpouring of God's love into His creation. If we truly felt that God lives in our heart, if we truly believed that God is our very being and that we live because God lives through us, then we would never feel any separation whatsoever. We would become what we are intended to be — vehicles for the infusion of God's grace into the world.

Problems come because we do not seek the kingdom first. We seek accomplishment first. Let us be very honest with ourselves and look at the way in which we approach this business of living. Don't we usually approach it first from the human point of view? You say: “Well, of course I do! I'm human. How else would I approach it?” Quite right, but there is another way of looking at ourselves. Although we are going through a human experience, we are not human beings. We are spiritual beings. We are sons of God going through a human experience. We must understand that we are not primarily sons of men; we are sons of God. So long as we believe that we are only human beings, we are going to experience pain, suffering, tears, disease, and death. But when we realize that the human aspect is but an expression of the divine reality, then a great new standard of living becomes operative. It becomes possible to walk this earth, through grace, as sons of God.

The spiritual way of life does not interest everybody. It is only when a person comes to see that we are here in life for a purpose, and that this purpose is to unfold, to grow, to learn, to develop, to live, walk, speak, think, and act as what we are — sons of God — that we really become interested in spiritual standards. When we surrender our human and worldly appetites, we do not give up anything; rather we attain something. But we do not do this just in order to attain. We do it because we know that this is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

As we give up all destructive, negative ties such as fears, worries, tensions, pressures, selfishness, and self-seeking, and live by grace instead of by effort, we will be free.

Only God is good. The good that comes forth from an individual comes from the spiritual self, the God-self. Man hasn't even begun to express the tremendous potential that lies beneath the surface. We need to learn one principle: As we give up all destructive, negative ties such as fears, worries, tensions, pressures, selfishness, and self-seeking, and live by grace instead of by effort, we will be free.

I had an awakening not too long ago. There is something that I had been wanting very, very much. I expressed this great desire in prayer — and listened for the answer. The ‘inner voice’ came through loud and clear. It said, “You must give up this desire, because any desire you have limits your potential for progress”.

I have been meditating upon this instruction ever since, and it has come to me that any time we intrude our personal wants and desires, or even our objectives and goals between ourselves and the full attainment of what God has in mind for us, we introduce limits that separate us from the God-within. We gain our true goal only by surrender, by bringing our gift to the altar and saying: “Father, you gave me this life, now I am giving it back to you. I am reporting for duty. I am emptying myself of these things which have put me in bondage. Use me ”.
