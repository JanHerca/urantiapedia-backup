_By Bobbie Dreier, New Jersey, United States_

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship's Summer Study Session 2018 will be held at Techny Towers in Northbrook, Illinois, again this year. It is an opportunity to join your Urantia Book family in study, worship, and fellowship.
As always, inspired speakers will share their thoughts, and creative students will provide engaging workshops.

In addition, there will be daily contemplative worship time. “Worship—contemplation of the spiritual—must alternate with service, contact with material reality.” <a id="a41_162"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3) We will take time to “contemplate the spiritual” so that we may better worship and serve along with our celestial family.

One of the great joys of attending a Urantia Book conference is greeting old friends and meeting new ones The smaller venue of the Summer Study Session allows for all the benefits of a larger conference but offers more opportunity for intimate sharing and extended conversations.

The Summer Study Session will be held from July 19 to 22 , preceded by a two-day spiritual retreat, “A Circle of Trust: Faith, Trust, and Assurance” beginning on Tuesday evening, July 17.
If you have an idea for a workshop related to the theme, “It's a Friendly Universe: Serving with Our Celestial Family,” contact Jackie Koury at jacquelyn.koury@gmail.com to request an application form.
You may register online at www.regonline.com/Urantia Fellowship SSS18.
