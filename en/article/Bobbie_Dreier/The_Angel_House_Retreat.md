In the Spring of 1999 New England readers hosted their first retreat at the Bement Camp Center in Charlton, MA. The experience, which included singing and dance as well as time for quiet meditation, was such a success that an annual event was planned. In 2002 Jorgey and Paul Krupa offered to host the retreat in their home - an open, gracious, angel-filled dwelling overlooking Shepherd's Cove on Assonet Bay, MA. For 16 years, every Spring, readers from as far away as Southern California have gathered for interactive workshops and to sing, dance, pray and worship as a spiritual family .  Plans for the retreat begin at the annual Northeast Readers' Jesus Birthday celebration in August. A theme is chosen and Jorgey begins organizing by inviting readers to present a talk, a workshop, a worship service or a creative experience of their choice. This year's theme was “Our Personal Relationship to Our Thought Adjuster.” A few months before the event she sends a comprehensive list inviting participants to choose their contribution for the potluck meals. Many attendees sleep in spare bedrooms, on couches or lounge chairs, or on mats with sleeping bags, and everyone participates in preparing, serving and cleaning up at mealtimes.

The retreat begins informally on Friday evening with a dinner for early arrivals. Retreat time is interspersed by buffet-style  meals indoors or on the magnificent grounds which have been lovingly landscaped by Paul. He also joyfully takes guests on a ride around Shepherd's Cove on his boat and builds a campfire each evening. A wide variety of musical selections and a big screen video presentation always enhance the retreat and a full color pamphlet and CD of the weekend's music is available to attendees as a reminder of the experience.

The retreat ends on Sunday morning with a creative worship ceremony culminating with a symbolic gift to each participant. This year's gift was a sailor's knot (see photo) symbolizing the unbreakable bond between a personality and his/her thought adjuster. In a quiet closing circle, the sense of communion is palpable and everyone leaves spiritually nourished and looking forward to the next gathering. The feelings shared by all who attend were expressed by Karen Larsen who said: “I count myself as blessed for being a part of this wonderful fellowship created by the hosts of the Angel House, Paul and Jorgey, who are two of my favorite human beings!”

The Krupas have recently moved to a smaller home so next year's retreat, scheduled for May 24-26 will be held at the CONNRI youth camp center in Ashford, CT. The theme is Truth.
