I was elected interim vice president at the August 15 th Zoom meeting of the Executive Committee following the resignation of Mike Painter. My job description:

Section 9.4. VicePresident: In the event of the inability of the President to act, the Vice-President shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of the President; and shall perform such other duties and exercise such other powers as may from time to time be imposed by the General Council, the Executive Committee, and the President.

I agreed to be nominated as it seemed highly unlikely that Geoff would be unable to act as president, and having been involved in many aspects of Fellowship functioning for 45 years I suspected that I would be able to perform “such other duties and exercises” that might be imposed on me. Since being elected to the General Council I have either attended or observed EC meetings, and I look forward to adding my voice to the EC's variety of diverse and thoughtful discussions until October when the General Council will fill the position for the balance of the term.
