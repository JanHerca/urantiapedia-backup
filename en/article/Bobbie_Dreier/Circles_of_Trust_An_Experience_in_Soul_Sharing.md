_By Bobbie Dreier, New Jersey, United States_

_Editor's Note: This retreat has been conducted by Gard Jameson, Bobbie Dreier, Marta Elders, and Carol Schindler for many years. The goal is to enhance the spiritual growth of readers and to deepen their appreciation of loving service_
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> “Happiness and joy take place in the inner life.” <a id="a45_52"></a>[UB 111:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_7)

The preconference retreat for the Urantia Book Fellowship's “International Urantia Conference 2017” will provide a space where the shy soul feels safe, an experience which favors religious growth by ...sharing one's spiritual life with one's fellows. <a id="a47_251"></a>[UB 100:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_8) By listening to spiritually evocative stories and poetry, and through deep respectful listening, we will support one another in our personal spiritual journeys. Participants will enjoy extended periods of communion and a worshipful time leading to loving service. Circles of Trust are based on principles described in _A Hidden Wholeness_ by Parker Palmer and _participants are required to read the book in preparation for the retreat_.

If you feel moved to learn how to “love by listening” in an experience designed to increase your soul consciousness, you are invited to join us for this summer's Circles of Trust.

The retreat begins on Monday, July 17, after dinner meets all day and evening on Tuesday, and Wednesday until lunch. Participation will be limited to thirty attendees.

You may register for the retreat as well as the conference at [www.IC17.org](https://www.IC17.org).
