The Angels of Progress theme for this Mighty Messenger came to me when Gard Jameson said that he thought the Angels of the Churches would give way to the Angels of Progress by 2030. This decade is one where we can ask ourselves how we can contribute to the work of the Angels of Progress.

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship has a new committee led by Sue Snider Seccombe, the Organizational Guidance Committee. The new vision and direction for the Fellowship is a featured article in this Mighty Messenger.

In addition, I asked people in our community what they are doing inspired by the teachings of the Urantia Book that contributes to the Angels of Progress. The creativity in our community always amazes me. My friend Michelle Klimesh found there are only a few quotes mentioning the Angels of Progress, so we have a lot to learn about them.

## Angels of Progress Urantia Book quotes

> (1) Although celestial artisans do not personally work on material planets, such as Urantia, they do come, from time to time, from the headquarters of the system to proffer help to the naturally gifted individuals of the mortal races. When thus assigned, these artisans temporarily work under the supervision of the planetary angels of progress. The seraphic hosts co-operate with these artisans in attempting to assist those mortal artists who possess inherent endowments, and who also possess Adjusters of special and previous experience. [UB 44:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p8_1)

> (2) 3. The religious guardians. These are the “angels of the churches,” the earnest contenders for that which is and has been. They endeavor to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of moral values from one epoch to another. They are the checkmates of the angels of progress, all the while seeking to translate from one generation to another the imperishable values of the old and passing forms into the new and therefore less stabilized patterns of thought and conduct. These angels do contend for spiritual forms, but they are not the source of ultra sectarianism and meaningless controversial divisions of professed religionists. The corps now functioning on Urantia is the fifth thus to serve. [UB 114:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_7)
