Translators helped make our first multilingual publications possible in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Special thanks go to Mora Franco, André Gurgel, Jack Holloway, and Felipe Arrigorriaga. Thank you, obrigada, e gracias!

Mora Franco helped by interviewing and writing for many people in the Spanish- speaking world about their projects related to spreading the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Jack Holloway, an avid reader of _The Urantia Book_ since the late 1970s, worked with numerous others in the mid-1990s to correct the many errors found in the original 1993 edition of _El Libro de Urantia_. This experience left him knowledgeable in translations in either direction, but particularly adept at translations from Spanish into English, the latter being his native language. 

As part of the International Fellowship Committee, Jack is a co-founder of the Latin America Subcommittee (LASC), connecting and supporting students of _The Urantia Book_ throughout the Spanish-speaking countries of the world with their projects.

Felipe Arrigorriaga 

In 2004. i participated a couple of times in a Urantia Book study group, not knowing what that book was or anything about it; then the group dissolved. Time passed and I started to see the [11:11 signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11:11_(numerology)). I didn't know anything about it either, until it was repeated many times and I thought, "This is weird; it's not a coincidence." I searched "11:11 " using Google and the first page was from the [11:11 Progress Group](https://www.1111angels.net/). 

From that moment my life began to change. Later I met Flor Robles in Santiago and participated in her study group. Today I cannot conceive my life without the revelation of _The Urantia Book_. By understanding everything better, I see life with different eyes, and I look for opportunities to serve my brothers and do the Will of the Father. In 2023, I began as Area Coordinator[^l] for Chile and assistant for _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship in Spanish, helping Geoff Theiss in his great work.
