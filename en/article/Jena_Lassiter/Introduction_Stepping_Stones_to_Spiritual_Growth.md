With this edition of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship's Mighty Messenger, Stepping Stones to Spiritual Growth edition, we wanted to produce a magazine specifically for people who know little about _The Urantia Book_ who are open minded and are “seeking more” spiritually.

We, who have been drawn to the ideas and values in _The Urantia Book_, have come seeking another way to understand more about the source of all things and the parts we play in an overall universe plan. We all come from different backgrounds-from religious backgrounds looking for something more, or from atheist or agnostic philosophies-with a curiosity about whether there is something more to this materialistic life, and from everywhere in between. We who continue to study this book have stayed with it because it has transformed our lives in some way.

If you are perusing these pages as someone who isn't familiar with _The Urantia Book_, you may have a religious background or may even question the idea of a personal god. Our hope is that some of the words in this edition will assist you on your spiritual journey. All of us would encourage you to take a peek at _The Urantia Book_. However, we are all happy to just encourage you to continue to pursue more truth and develop your own personal religion without necessarily relying on _The Urantia Book_. 

If you are looking for a quick summary: _The Urantia Book_ is a 2,097 page text containing beautiful spiritual teachings, including what seems to many of us to be a unique perspective on deity. It integrates science and philosophy with religion. The book depicts the history of our universe, our planet, and civilization and it contains an in-depth account of the life and teachings of Jesus. A few of us have called it a hyperdimensional tool that makes you think things you didn't know you needed to think and that you can't unthink-or a quick reference guide to the spiritual universe. (The complete reference manual to the spiritual universe might be billions of pages.)

The purposes of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship are to foster and support an evolving spiritual community of truth seekers dedicated to learning, sharing, and living the advanced truths revealed in _The Urantia Book_ to enhance our spiritual perception and capacity for loving service.
