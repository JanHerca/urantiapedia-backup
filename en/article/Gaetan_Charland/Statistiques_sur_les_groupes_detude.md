It is my pleasure to share with you an update on the study group directory. Bill Beasley is the chair of the committee and always keeps the committee on track. Scott Brooks is the website administrator and handles updates, the annual cleanup project, and general site maintenance. Jackie Koury represents the Fellowship and responds to many email inquiries. Rick Lyon has been the representative of Urantia Association International for many years. He has done a lot of work, including answering the majority of reader inquiries and scraping data for the website. However, Urantia Association felt that this position would be best left to the chair of the association's study group committee, so we selected Phillip Marriott of Australia to join our team. He is dedicated and has agreed to continue all of the work that Rick has done.

The database cleanup is now complete, ensuring that the directory is the most up-to-date for _Urantia Book_ study groups. What an excellent example of a cooperative field done right!

Directory statistics for the fourth quarter on Study Groups.

New groups down by 9 (this is due to database cleanup)
