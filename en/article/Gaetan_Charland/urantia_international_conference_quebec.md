**30 July–2 August**

There are only a few weeks left before Urantia Association’s International Conference in Quebec. If you have not done so, please register now by [clicking here](http://urantia-association.org/2014/11/01/2015-urantia-association-international-conference/) to visit the event’s web page. There you will find all the information you will need to register, including directions to the venue whether you come by car, plane, or bus.

This might be your first time attending such an event and your expectations might be very high. You will not be disappointed! The program will provide ample opportunities to satisfy the intellect as well as your spiritual needs. Not only does it focus on child education, but it also explores the fostering of spiritual maturity in everyday living. While all workshops are planned to compliment the plenaries, we will also explore diverse views of _The Urantia Book_.

The speakers and workshop facilitators are all long-time students of _The Urantia Book_; they were chosen because of their experience with education at all levels of life and for their devotion to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

The biggest challenge for the conference organizers has been the sponsorship of international readers, especially those from Africa, South America, and Asia. Many have been refused entry to Canada even after providing all the necessary information. We have received fifty-four requests for financial aid, and we are doing our best to assist them. We are pleased and feel blessed that we have been able to help many attend. Thank you if you have supported this good effort!

We are embracing our challenges and hoping you will join us for this international event. Do not let this unique opportunity pass for it might not happen again in your lifetime. Quebec, Canada, is an amazing place to visit in the summer months—especially if you like lakes, forests, fishing, whale-watching, or simply enjoying Quebec’s hospitality as well as its unique French culture. Please come visit us and [REGISTER NOW](https://www.regonline.ca/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID=1643032)
