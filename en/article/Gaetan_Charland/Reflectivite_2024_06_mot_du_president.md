Dear readers and esteemed members of the association,

While spring has barely begun, summer already seems to be just around the corner. It is undeniable that time flies by at a dizzying speed. This perception of time varies from one person to another, but it is commonly accepted that the older we get, the more time seems to escape us at a frantic pace. This phenomenon, which I call relative time, could be the subject of a conference in its own right.

Rather than dwelling on the theory of the relativity of time, let's focus on how we can make the most of this time that is slipping away from us. Many people dedicate their retirement to volunteering, finding meaning and a reason for living. As a student of revelation, it would be a shame to let this precious time slip away without giving back what we have so generously received.

The association is there to support you in your desire to make this time useful and beneficial, both for others and for yourself, by contributing to your spiritual development. If you have a project that is close to your heart and that is part of the mission of the _Urantia Book_, the association could provide you with support to make it a reality. Every project requires a conductor, and you could be that person. The association would be there to support you by helping you find the resources necessary to carry it out.

Together, let's make this time allotted to us a period of accomplishment and sharing. I encourage you to contact us if the invitation to give value to your time resonates with you a taste for service.

Several years ago, I was thinking about how we could better share the teachings of The Urantia Book, and today, this thought continues to haunt me. I even thought of a project aimed at transforming us into better truth sowers, but to carry it out, I would need many volunteers. I thought of calling this group “The Truth Sowers.” This group would have the mission of developing strategies and methods inspired by the way Jesus, during his voyage around the Mediterranean, sowed seeds of truth, which greatly contributed to the effectiveness of his apostles in their ministry after his death.

It is largely thanks to this approach that Christianity was able to establish itself throughout the Roman Empire of the time. Let us imagine for a moment that a group of students of revelation undertake in Quebec what Jesus accomplished during his Mediterranean journey. Let us carefully reread what the revelators tell us in the Publication Mandate:

“You must study anew the time of Jesus on earth. You must take careful note of how the kingdom of heaven was inaugurated in the world. Did it evolve slowly and develop naturally, or did it come with a sudden manifestation of force and a spectacular display of power? Was it evolutionary or revolutionary?”

This time of year is sowing time. For the harvest to be plentiful, those who sow must respect the laws of nature and let time do its work. We must, in a way, adopt the same approach with the teachings of The Urantia Book. If we want the harvest to be plentiful, we must be inspired by the way Jesus did it.

To love is to serve!
