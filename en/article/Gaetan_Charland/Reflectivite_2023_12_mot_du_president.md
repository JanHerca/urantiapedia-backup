Dear members and friends of the association,

Time flies by, doesn't it? It seems like we've only just started the year and now we're already approaching the Christmas and New Year festivities. This period brings me back to the excellent conference entitled “Au théâtre du temps”, presented by Sophie Malicot during the virtual conferences organized by the Urantia Association of Quebec. André Malraux said: “Lost time is the time during which we are at the mercy of others.” This invites us to reflect on the use of time over the past year.

Over the past month, I have had the pleasure of attending two other enriching conferences. One was on the material mind presented by Claude Flibotte, while Assane Diagne led another, more restricted conference on the Planetary Government and the 12 groups of super angels who oversee the progress of our planet.

It is, however, regrettable to note that despite the considerable efforts made by the presenters in preparing these conferences, very few readers were present.

I then ask myself an important question, dear readers: what types of activities would arouse your interest and deserve your attention and participation to make your time more meaningful? What themes and forms of conferences would encourage you to become more involved? Pierre Routhier, a well-known figure among you, often repeated: “I have time to give, but no time to waste.” This thought often comes to mind as I see the efforts made to encourage your participation in the association's activities. Let us not forget, regrets do not bring back lost time.

You have surely noticed that to maintain a fire, several logs are necessary. A single log cannot sustain the flames for long, but would quickly go out without the addition of other logs. Likewise, for each of us, our spiritual fire needs the contribution of our brothers and sisters in spirit. The solitary reading of _The Urantia Book_ is not enough to feed our spiritual flame. We need to share our love for the truth, like logs feeding the fire, we need the momentum of others to maintain the spiritual flame and let the light of the Spirit that resides in us shine.

It is precisely for this reason that our association organizes conferences, promotes study groups and encourages your participation in the courses offered by different virtual schools available on our site. We are also pleased to invite you to a holiday dinner which will be held in a center in the city of Bellefeuille on December 15. Please confirm your attendance before December 5 by contacting Claudette Gonthier at secretaire@urantiaqc.org or by calling her at 438 523 3121. For more information, see the announcement included on page 2.

During this festive period, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you happy holidays with your family and friends.

Let us not forget those who will spend this period alone, without the comfort of a home.

To love is to serve.
