_By Gaétan Charland, associate trustee, Québec, Canada_

As a new associate trustee of Urantia Foundation, I was given the opportunity to choose a committee on which to serve. Because of my extensive travels in Latin American countries while serving as president of Urantia Association International, the committee that is planning the introduction of the new Spanish revision was the choice for me.

Before my appointment in 2018 , I had been unaware of the extensive revision process of translations of _The Urantia Book_, and of the effort and commitment of those involved in those projects. What an enlightening discovery it was when I became acquainted with the work of the Spanish revision team!

This past September, I had the great privilege of meeting with the five team members—Olga López, Anibal Pacheco, Víctor García-Bory, Carmelo Martínez, and Raúl Pujol—at Urantia Foundation. Richard Jernigan came as well to make video recordings about each team member's experience with the revision process. During those three days, I learned much about their experiences and saw them working together polishing certain parts of the revision that needed special attention.

It is hard to convey what I experienced during that time with such devoted individuals who have dedicated themselves to this work for nearly a decade. Of one thing I am certain: their goal was to produce a revision that would respect and express, to the highest possible level, the beauty, meanings, and truth of the many concepts in the original book.

Every team member has a good grasp and understanding of the English text as well as the Spanish one. They come from five different countries and two different continents. All have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for years in English and Spanish, and have participated in study groups, some in both languages. You could not put together a better team! Not only are they intellectually capable of this work, they have the ability to work as a team—and they have something more that is of the greatest value: love for the Urantia Revelation.

During my flight back home, felt a renewed sense of duty toward the Urantia Book project. I found myself praying for every Spanishspeaking reader to embrace this new revision with as much love as the revision team has put into it. If you are part of a study group, you will understand what I mean when I compare their dedication to a long-standing study group where each member contributes to the enhancement of perception of all the other members. This new revision will open the door to a new and better understanding of the truth and concepts in _El Libro de Urantia_ for all its students.
