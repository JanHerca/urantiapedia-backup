For several years, Fellowship President Sue Seccombe has been discussing with our President, Enrique Traver, ways for the Association and the Fellowship to collaborate. In October 2023, the Fellowship General Council approved a resolution establishing a “Committee on Unity” to explore and make recommendations regarding “the details and options...of next steps on unity between [our] two organizations.” The Fellowship selected their Committee members, who were approved at their General Council meeting in February 2024.

In February, the Association approved the creation of a Special Committee on Unity, granting it the authority to continue discussions with the Fellowship with a view to unifying our two organizations. The members of our Committee are Gaétan Charland (Canada), chair of the committee, Michael Zehr (United States), Andrés Rodriguez (Colombia), Chris Moseley (United Kingdom), and Susan Owen (United States). The committee met virtually on April 29 to get to know each other and discuss the benefits and challenges of unity with the Fellowship. A second meeting was held on May 15 to get to know each other better and discuss expectations for this endeavor. No date has been set for the first meeting with the Fellowship.
