Many members of various Urantia organizations, as well as students of the revelation, as well as our members, may wonder why the unification of our two Urantia organizations, Urantia Association International and the Urantia Book Brotherhood, is so important, so crucial. A recent survey conducted by Urantia Association revealed that an overwhelming majority—92.3 percent of respondents—are in favor of unity. While many of us pray for unity within the Urantia movement, we may not fully understand what this unity will require of each of us, and of the two associations involved in this unification process.

Unity is not simply a matter of concern for the welfare of the organizations involved; it has a significant impact on the mission of revelation in the world. Why is this so? To answer this, we must ask the right questions. Consider what the young Jesus pondered when faced with important decisions: “As the years went by, this young carpenter from Nazareth increasingly measured every institution of society and every use of religion by the invariable test: What does it do for the human soul? Does it bring God closer to man? Does it bring man closer to God?”

In the context of the fourth and fifth epochal revelations, the welfare of the mission of the revelation must take precedence over the welfare of the organizations. Our questions should be: Does being united better serve the revelation, or does it hinder its mission in the world? Does unity reduce confusion and create more harmony? What is my primary goal—the mission of the revelation or the welfare of the organizations? These are critical questions we must ask ourselves as we consider the unity of our two organizations.

When it comes to the spiritual appeal of our organizations, what image do we project to the world? Are we seen as a cohesive and united family, or are we seen as divided and fragmented? As it is said in ***The Urantia Book***, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” It is crucial that we embody the teachings of this revelation if we are truly committed to the success of our organizations in spreading light to the world.

The greatest challenge we face is to come together as one organization, living out the teachings we are eager to share with the world. Are we willing to embrace our roles as true children of God, working harmoniously as spiritual brothers and sisters? Does our dedication to organizations and our beliefs take precedence over the greater good of revelation? Are we willing to present a united front to the world, ready to face the spiritual challenges that lie ahead?

Aren't we meant to be the light of the world? Have we lost our ability to influence and inspire? It is imperative that we put aside our differences and stand united in our mission to take the message of Jesus to every corner of the world. Division will only hinder our ability to fulfill this vital mission and share the abundance of spiritual gifts that revelation has to offer. Let us strive to be beacons of unity and strength, ready to face the spiritual battles ahead with unwavering resolve.

The division has resulted in significant damage, causing confusion among students and pushing some away from organized services. It has fostered unhealthy competition between organizations and students in their efforts to attract human and financial resources, depleting essential assets through redundant projects. However, there is hope for improvement by acknowledging past mistakes and learning from history.

We should also ask ourselves who really benefits from our division into multiple organizations.

I encourage you to think and pray about how we can best serve the revelation and Michael. We are not alone in this effort; the angels of the churches and the angels of progress are undoubtedly seeking unity among us and working with us to share this revelation with the world.

Are we ready to take on the challenge of living in accordance with the teachings of Jesus, the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of all people?

In the future, history will tell who we really are.
