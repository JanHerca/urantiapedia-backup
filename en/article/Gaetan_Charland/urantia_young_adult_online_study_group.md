At the beginning of December 2015 I attended a new online study group that is designed mainly for young readers. This new group was initiated by Antonio Schefer and is facilitated by Jeffrey Wattles. It is international and uses a very efficient Web platform called Zoom to gather and unite the participants. This Web application allows participants to see each other if they so desire, and the facilitator can share his screen, documents, power point presentations and even videos. All the sessions are recorded so each participant may review the session at their leisure when it is made available online by Antonio Schefer.

What is more outstanding and avant-garde about this virtual study group is its curriculum and protocol. With the expert assistance of Jeffrey Wattles, the group focuses its activities on training leaders and teachers by exploring passages from the life and teachings of Jesus as exemplified in _The Urantia Book_. But it does not stop there; it also encourages participants to become actively present at conferences by giving presentations and facilitating workshops. The group also explores how Jesus shared and disseminated his teachings and how each of us can, in our own ways be inspired to adapt and apply the Master’s methods in our own communities.

It is very refreshing and encouraging to witness such an initiative as this online study group method. It responds to the requests given to us by the revelators in the Publication Mandate to help train leaders and teachers and create thousands of study groups. Those same revelators also encouraged us to study the life of Jesus to find ways to achieve our mission as teachers and leaders.

I believe that when more study groups endorse this curriculum, we will see great changes happening not only in our own lives, but in our families and communities. If you would like to join this study group or view a recording of one of them, please contact Antonio Schefer at [conference@triniteit.org](mailto:conference@triniteit.org).
