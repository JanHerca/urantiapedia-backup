Dear members and friends of the association,

Recently, I traveled to Chicago, to the Urantia Foundation headquarters, to participate in a board meeting. Due to the pandemic, it was the first time in four long years that I had left Canada. All other meetings were done virtually. Over the past twenty-three years, this place has become like a second home outside of Quebec.

My visit had a dual objective, as an associate trustee, and as president of the Urantia Association of Quebec. It was an opportunity to share with my colleagues from the Foundation, who came from all four corners of the world, the unique perspective of our Urantian culture. At each of the meetings, my colleagues are impressed by the dynamism of the Quebec people. And for my part, it allows me to stay informed of the Urantia activities sponsored by the Urantia Foundation throughout the world.

I would like to point out that over the past year, the Foundation has sold over eighteen thousand three hundred books, representing a 2% increase over the previous year. However, sales of French-language books in Quebec have fallen by 51% so far, with only 107 copies sold in bookstores. It should be noted that many French-language books are also sold through Amazon, and it is difficult to define how many of these are destined for Quebec. In addition, many digital copies are downloaded from the Foundation's website and our website, far outpacing online and bookstore sales, with nearly forty-eight thousand digital copies.

However, I would like to draw your attention to one imperative point: Urantia Foundation needs donations to balance its annual budget. Currently, all books are sold at a loss, and the Foundation subsidizes these purchases. This cannot continue without negative consequences that could hinder their mission.

We do not always realize the considerable sums of money spent to fund translations and revisions, which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single translation. I encourage you to visit the Urantia Foundation website, where you will find extensive information about their activities, and to consider making a donation to support their mission in disseminating The Urantia Book.

Moving on to another topic, we are all aware of the conflict raging in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Often, when such clashes break out, it is difficult to take sides or show support. My first reaction to this conflict was to pray that the leaders involved would show wisdom and benevolence in handling this crisis. We all yearn for peace, and in such situations, it is often tempting to take a position by blaming one or the other.

That is why I encourage you to read the article written by John Pavlovitz, author, pastor, activist and storyteller, that we published in this month's Reflectivity. I took the initiative to translate his text, because I believe that it offers a relevant response to the current situation in the Middle East, as well as throughout the world, where war is raging. John Pavlovitz is an extraordinary individual, courageous in his faith and committed to promoting human brotherhood.

I had the privilege of learning about his thinking and his dynamic approach to solving life's problems a few years ago through his periodic newsletter and it inspires me to get more involved in the mission of the _Urantia Book_. I would like to see more people like John Pavlovitz in the world, and even here in Quebec, because their example could encourage us to do more in our respective communities to make the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ known. If you speak English, I invite you to visit his website and subscribe to his newsletter: https://johnpavlovitz.com.

Right now, I'm seriously considering the possibility of resuming in-person association conferences. I think it would be beneficial to meet face to face, give each other a warm hug, and share a meal together.

I end by repeating the words of a friend I met a long time ago: “Be good!”

To love is to serve
