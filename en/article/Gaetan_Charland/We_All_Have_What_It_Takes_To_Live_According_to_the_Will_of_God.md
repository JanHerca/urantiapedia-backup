Yes we all have what it takes to live according to the will of God and in doing so, we can be certain of reaching Paradise one day in the eternal future. But to have all the right qualities and know how to make that long trip is not enough; we have to act according to our decisions and those decisions must be the right ones. The survival of our personality and our fusion with our adjuster is dependent upon our decisions, the intention behind the decisions and the actions that will be supportive of those decisions. All those decisions and actions must be motivated and enriched by our faith. We can say that without decisions and actions there is no spiritual progress.

Are we doing all that it takes? Do we have a plan for achieving our spiritual goals? Do we know how to reform our self spiritually? Do we think and live according to our spiritual wish? Do we express in our intentions and actions the will of our divine Father? Those are questions that must confront us in our everyday life. We have to push ourselves further and further on the road of mastering and transcending our animal nature if we really want to answer the call of our divine gift the Mystery Monitor.

## 1. The Two Commandments

> _God, having commanded man to be perfect, even as be is perfect, has descended as the Adjusster to become man's experiential partner in the achievement of the supernal destiny which has been thus ordained. The fragment of God which indwells the mind of man is the absolute and unqualified assurance that man can find the Universal Father in association with this divine Adjuster, which came forth from God to find man and sonship him even in the days of the flesh._ [[UB 107:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_3)]

This commandment is one of the first in a series of two which speak to us of the will of God. The second commandment was given to us by Jesus:

> _“And you must change yet more. You should become the apostle of the new commandment which I have this night given you. Dedicate your life to teaching your bretbren how to love one another, even as I have loved you.”_ [[UB 181:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_4)]

Sometimes we humans look for all kinds of different answers and ways to accomplish God's will, yet we tend to forget the most basic of actions, that is, to accomplish what we desire the most, to be like our Father, in loving service to others.

## 2. The Will of God

All through the papers conceming the Adjusters, we are constantly reminded that the Mystery Monitors are the WILL of God and that they work incessantly to make us receptive to that WILL.

> _Every mortal who is consciously or unconsciously following the leading of bis indwelling Adjuster is living in accordance with the will of God. Consciousness of Adjuster presence is consciousness of God's presence._ [[UB 107:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_4)]

Those simple truths and commandments should be enough to guide us to the portal of eternal life. But we humans sometimes required a lot more facts, truths and enlightenment to start progressing on the upward road to perfection and divinity. Let us have a look on the relation of Adjusters to individual mortals.

## 3. Relation of the Adjuster to Humans

The first thing that we read in this paper is:

> _I regard the love and devotion of a Thought Adjuster as the most truly divine affection in all creation. The love of the Sons in their ministry to the races is superb, but the devotion of an Adjuster to the individual is touchingly sublime, divinely Fatherlike. The Paradise Father has apparently reserved this form of personal contact with his individual creatures as an exclusive Creator prerogative. And there is nothing in all the universe of universes exactly comparable to the marvelous ministry of these impersonal entities that so fascinatingly indwell the children of the evolutionary planets._ [[UB 110:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p0_2)]

The relation of Adjusters to the children of time is LOVE, divine love manifested in every day of our lives, whether we are conscious of it or not. The Adjusters that volunteered to come and indwell our minds came with a plan, an eternal career plan that we can choose to follow or reject entirely. They have spent probably more time and energy formulating a grand design for our life than we will ever realize here on earth. What are we doing about it? How much time and energy are we ready to invest on our mortal plan to join in the efforts of our divine Guide?

How can we know more about this plan? What are the things that we can do in order to learn more about this magnificent design? There are answers in _The Urantia Book_ about what we can do to be more receptive to the leading of our Adjuster. Those answers might or might not be the one that we want to hear or read about; human beings tend to look for an easy way out but in this “propos” UP and IN would be the proper words. Let us have a look at what we can or cannot do, to go hand in hand and mind to mind with our Adjuster.

## 4. Our Attitudes and Actions.

> _But how unkind knowingly to defile or otherwise deliberately to pollute the plysical body, which must serve as the earthly tabernacle of this marvelous gift from God. All pbysical poisons greatly retard the efforts of the Adjuster to exalt the material mind, while the mental poisons of fear, anger, enyy, jealousy, suspicion, and intolerance likewise tremendously interfere with the spiritual progress of the evolving soul._ [[UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5)]

What are these physical poisons that retard the efforts of the Adjuster in exalting the material mind? Could they be what we call drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and certain kinds of food! If we really have a supreme desire to work hand in hand, mind to mind with our Adjuster, we should start looking for ways to replace or eliminate some or all of those substances from our lives. We should start by getting some healthier life habits. Those improvements could be some regular physical exercise or different eating habits. We all know the expression “A sound mind in a sound body.” Here it takes its full measure.

What are we going to do now with the mental poisons? How do we get rid of these bad traits of personality and character? Probably a good dose of sincerity and humility would help us look into ourselves and see who we really are and what we can do about it. Here is what _The Urantia Book_ tell us:

> _The keys of the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men bave these keys. Men use them—advance in spirit status—by decisions, by more decisions, and by more decisions. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all of them—this is to choose to do the will of God._ [[UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14)]

> _Too often, all too often, you mar your minds by insincerity and sear them with unrighteousness; you subject them to animal fear and distort them by useless anxiety. Therefore, though the source of mind is divine, mind as you know it on your world of ascension can hardly become the object of great admiration, much less of adoration or worship. The contemplation of the immature and inactive human intellect should lead only to reactions of humility._ [[UB 9:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p5_7)]

We can help ourselves by praying every day to our Father to teach us to overcome our human handicaps. We can practice meditation as Rodan of Alexandria enjoined the apostles to do in light of the Master's life habits. We can try to live our life according to the precepts of the philosophy of Rodan. “Where there is a will, there is always a way”—the old saying says. If we want the relation of our Adjuster with us to be more effective, we have to act, make decisions and abide by them. We have to die to our old ways of thinking. We have to find new ways to enhance our perception of the leading of our Adjusters. We have to reach upward as strongly as our Adjuster is reaching downward.

If we find that we have to acquire more tolerance, more patience or more humility, then we have to pray to God to help us acquire those qualities, but in return we have to expect some life situations where we will have to practice the acquirement of those same qualities by decisions and practice. When a professional body builder wants to get bigger and better muscles, he has to train himself every day till he achieves his desired goals. Why should it be differentre with the mind? We have to become professional faith persons. We have to bear the fruits of the spirit.

> _The proof of fraternity with the divine Adjuster consists wholly in the nature and extent of the fruits of the spirit which are yielded in the life experience of the individual believer. “By their fruits you shall know them.”_ [65.0]

> _. . . “Yor the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.” Such spirit-guided and divinely illuminated mortals, while they yet tread the lowly paths of toil and in human faithfulness perform the duties of their earthly assignments, have already begun to discern the lights of eternal life as they glimmer on the faraway shores of another world..._ [[UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)]

## 5. Our Will and Desires.

Our Adjusters love us so much that never will they do violence to our minds in trying to get us to change our thoughts. They will always respect our will, even if it means our spiritual death.

> _They are persistent, ingenious, and perfect in their methods of work, but they never do violence to the volitional selfhood of their hosts. No human being will ever be spiritualized by a divine Monitor against his will; survival is a gift of the Gods which must be desired by the creatures of time._ [[UB 110:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_2)]

Here is a word that deserves to be emphasized: **DESIRE**. Our relation with our Adjuster must be bonded in supreme desire and love. How can we cooperate more with our indwelling friend? _The Urantia Book_ tells us that our survival does not depend so much on the theories of our beliefs as upon our decisions, determination and steadfast faith. The secret of survival is wrapped up in our supreme desire to be Godlike and to be willing to do any and all things that are essential to the final attainment of that overmastering desire. Adjusters never fail in their undertakings; they are perfect. We are the ones that fail them when we deprive them of the possibilities to gain personality through us.

The great goal of our human existence is to attune to the divinity of our Adjuster. It is like listening to music on a radio. If we want to hear classical music, we have to tune the radio to the right frequency. If we are not on the right frequency then we might hear all kinds of music except the one that we desire. We have to realize that to be attuned to our divine destiny does not mean to live a life of self-torture and slavery, but a life of joy, of loving service, and of material and spiritual realizations.

## 6. What We Can Do

The cooperation with our Adjuster is not exactly a conscious process. It is mostly based on our motives, our decisions, our faithful determinations and our supreme desire. These attitudes of our mind and will constitute the real essence of cooperation. We are told that we can augment consciously the Adjuster harmony by:

1. Living our life with our highest concepts of truth, beauty and goodness-not the ones dictated by moral standard ot popular belief. We have to try to coordinate these qualities through wisdom, worship, faith and love.
2. To love God and to desire to be like him. We must accept and recognize him as our divine father and live our life like a true son of that father.
3. To love our fellow man sincerely and to serve him in joy and happiness. All this must be done intelligently with wise affection.
4. To accept joyfully our cosmic citizenship and our progressive obligations to God the Supreme.

If we make a true effort to understand these principles, then we are on our way upward and inward. We also have to accept the idea that in our effort to attune ourselves to our Adjuster we might encounters difficulties, we might get confused, even sometimes discouraged and distracted, but this does not signify resistance to the leading of our Monitor. These problems sometimes connote lack of active cooperation and may somewhat delay spiritual progress. Only conscious resistance to the Adjuster's leading can prevent the survival of the immortal soul.

## 7. What Is the Adjuster's Action in the Mind?

We are told that Adjusters are receptors to continuous streams of cosmic intelligence that are coming over the master circuits of time and space. But all this magnificent wealth of wisdom and truth is lost to our minds because of our lack of commonness of nature and the absence of responsive recognition. This tells us a lot about the difference between us and our Adjusters. The more we achieve spirit progression, the more the Adjuster is able to communicate these spirituals truths to us. It is like listening to a radio on the AM bandwidth when we have to tune in to the FM. It is a matter of harmony between our physical self, our mind and our spirit.

The Adjuster is engaged in a constant effort to spiritualize our mind in order to evolve our morontia soul. In doing this magnificent work there might come into our mind some pictures, thoughts or mind concepts. These parcels of activities are not always the work of the Adjusters, and we have to be very careful in trying to interpret them. Probably they are better relegated to the work of our own subconscious mind at work. We have to trust our Adjuster in all matters of mind beyond the dead level of consciousness. In due time, if not on this world then on the mansion worlds, they will give good account of their stewardships. They will resurrect every worthy treasure of the mortal mind.

## 8. Misconception of Adjuster Communications

The Adjusters in their work of spiritualizing our mind will use many methods of contact with our superconscious mind. In our effort to try to converse with our Adjuster we might sometimes believe that we do hear his guidance. You might have heard some people say to you or others, “My Adjuster told me so” or “I have those beautiful dreams and I believe my Adjuster is communicating with me!” The work of the Adjuster is not to tell us what to do and what not to do; his work his a lot more subtle than we realize. Let us try to visualize the way he might work. Let us imagine that when we have an important spiritual decision to make and we ask for his help, it will probably work like following the trail of a very faint perfume: we might like what we smell or not, depending on our will and desire to do the will of our Father. Never will the Adjusters force his way on us about the way to do certain things. If he would work like this, then we would have no merit for our decisions and actions. We would not have freedom of choice.

In our desire to become like our Father, we modify the way we think, feel and live. Our faith increases our desire to do his will, to love and to serve our fellow men. The will of God is of the essence of love, forgiveness and service. So anytime we believe that we should impose on others what we believe is a message from our Adjuster, let us think twice and use the little wisdom we have and ask ourselves this one question: what would Jesus have done in my place? Let us not embark on the road of interpretation or trying to discern in our every thoughts and dreams a message from our Adjusters. It is too dangerous a road, and it can make us more of an unbalanced personality than a serviceable one.

We are told in _The Urantia Book_ that, because of our animal inheritance and our preconceived ideas, it has become more and more difficult for self-acting Adjusters to work effectively in the human mind. So we should try to be more careful in the interpretations of our thoughts. In our desires to progress on our upward and inward journey we are told that we are at the same time traversing psychic levels of mind accomplishment that help our Divine Monitor to better communicate with us. Let us have a look at these.

## 9. The Psychic Circles

In reading the part of the paper concerning the psychic circles, who has not tried to figure out in which circle one is or one has attained. The reason probably that we are told of these circles is like telling us a little bit more of the master plan for attaining perfect harmony with our Adjuster and the will of God. It is like a map by which we might try to better ourselves. It is a guideline to give us hope in showing us the way to harmony.

Again we are told that not only spiritual attainments are desirable but intellectual as well as physical. We have to do more than just read the fourth part of the book or to read only _The Urantia Book_ to acquire a balanced personality. We need to address the needs of our intellectual and physical dimensions. To better our intellectual and cultural development we could read books on science, philosophy or history so we could grasp a better understanding of the world around us. We could learn music and all kinds of arts so we could harmonize in beauty our views of life and our thinking. In knowing more of science it would help us to be more realistic and open in order to see and understand the different expressions of God in the material universe. In knowing more about philosophy, it would help us in our efforts to harmonize our faith and beliefs to our new ways of living. It would also help us understand the importance of a personal religion the way _The Urantia Book_ is teaching us.

Look at Jesus. Was he not always eager to leam the ways of the world so he could better serve humanity in return? Did he not leam to play music, to paint and to speak other languages? Jesus has given us all the examples that we will ever need; we only have to follow our highest desires and act on them.

The attainment of the circles is more like a degree of self-realization based on our personal relation to GOD. No two persons are alike. We might have similar results in the final accomplishment of all the circles, but everyone will have had different experiences to get there. And this is what makes us so unique to the Supreme Being: we are like his receptors of evolutionary experiences. He feels, lives, loves, serves and progresses through us and with us. He is our common family relation in this evolutionary universe; he is the one that makes us all part of the same family. We are part of his mind. Each one of us is a little cell of his infinite personality expression.

The day that we will fully realize the Supreme Being personality expression through us, then on that day we will be in perfect harmony with the will of God and in synchronicity of purpose with our Adjuster. That event will mark our entry into the first circle and lead us to our predestined fusion with the infinite fragment of God the Father. We will give expression of that gift through our exalted personality and our unreserved dedication to doing the Father's will.

We have to work constantly everyday in order to progress in our supreme desire to be as perfect as our Father is, to ascend the circles one by one till the day we unite with our Adjuster and hear that divine voice that will say to us: “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few essentials; you shall be made ruler over universe realities.”

The conquest of these levels of cosmic evolution is reflected in three ways:

> _1._ ***Adjuster attunement***. _The spiritiring mind nears the Adjuster presence proportional to circle attainment._
> _2._ **Soul evolution**. _The emergence of the morontia soul indicates the extent and depth of circle mastery._
> _3._ **Personality reality**. _The degree of selfhood reality is directly determined by circle conquest. Persons become more real as they ascend from the seventh to the first level of mortal existence._ [[UB 110:6.8-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_8)]

We are told again in the following excerpt the importance to put into action our desires and our decisions to live according to the will of God who is manifested in the Mystery Monitor guiding influence.

> _The motivation of faith makes experiential the full realization of man's sonship with God, but action, completion of decisions, is essential to the evolutionary attainment of consciousness of progressive kinship with the cosmic actuality of the Supreme Being. Faith transmutes potentials to actuals in the spiritual world, but potentials become actuals in the finite realms of the Supreme only by and through the realization of choice-experience. But choosing to do the will of God joins spiritual faith to material decisions in personality action and thus supplies a divine and spiritual fulcrum for the more effective functioning of the human and material leverage of God-bunger. Such a wise co-ordination of material and spiritual forces greatly augments both cosmic realization of the Supreme and morontia comprehension of the Paradise Deities._ [[UB 110:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_17)]

## 10. The Final Destiny

After having passed through all of the seven circles we will require yet another more sublime spiritual achievement upon the attainment of a final and complete attunement of the mortal will with the will of God as it is resident in the Thought Adjuster. Then will we be ready to consummate with our Adjuster the final enactment of eternal import: the complete fusion of our personality with our Adjuster. In this eternal embrace will we attain immortality status.

Upon our attainment of immortality and fusion with our Adjuster, we will both benefit from this joining. The Adjuster will gain personality status and we will gain infinity status. Everything that is his, will be ours; and everything that is ours, will be his. We will be just as one. There is in this union born a new being. In a certain sense, this new being is of the eternal past as well as for the eternal future. And it will take eternity for us to acquire the full potential of this eternal gift of the Mystery Monitor.

In conclusion of everything that was expressed in these many words, we have to remember this one simple truth: intention of purpose is tantamount to our survival status.

> _Though the cosmic circles of personality grow th must eventually be attained, if, through no fault of your own, the accidents of time and the bandicaps of material existence prevent your mastering these levels on your native planet, if your intentions and desires are of survival value, there are issued the decrees of probation extension. You will be afforded additional time in which to prove yourself._ [[UB 112:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6)]

> _And it is not so much what mind comprehends as what mind desires to comprehend that insures survival; it is not so much what mind is like as what mind is striving to be like that constitutes spirit identification. It is not so much that man is conscious of God as that man yearns for God that results in universe ascension. What you are today is not so important as, what you are becoming day by day and in eternity._ [1216.6-1217:0]
