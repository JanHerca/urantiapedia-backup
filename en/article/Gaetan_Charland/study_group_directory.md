**Dear Friends of _The Urantia Book_,**

As most of you would know, the mission of Urantia Association International is: “To foster study of _The Urantia Book_ and to disseminate its teachings,” and according to the Publication Mandate, “Thousands of study groups must be brought into existence.”

A few years ago a joint service project was initiated—volunteers of Urantia Foundation, Urantia Association International and The Urantia Book Fellowship created an online Study Group Directory. This Internet resource has been well received and hundreds of study groups around the world are currently listed, making it easy for new or experienced students to locate and attend a study group. To this day, the directory has been translated into French, Spanish, Russian, and Portuguese.

Much work remains to be done if we are to accomplish the mission we were given so long ago; the directory needs to be translated into many more languages so that readers from every part of the world can find a study group in their area. And we also need every host to participate by registering their group in the directory. It’s easy to create a profile that provides your meeting information and contact details so that readers can find you and new friendships can grow! The directory also offers the option to list virtual study groups such as the ones taking place with Skype or Google Hangout.

As readers who are dedicated to the mission given to us by the revelators, I ask you to register your study group and encourage the hosts of the study groups in your area to register their group on the Study Group Directory at this address: [http://www.urantiastudygroup.org](http://www.urantiastudygroup.org/). Not only do we need every group to be listed, we also need volunteers to translate the directory in Finish, Estonian, Korean, Italian, German, Dutch, Chinese, Hindu, Pakistani and other languages. If you would like to be such a volunteer, please contact me at this address: [studygroupchair.uai@gmail.com](mailto:studygroupchair.uai@gmail.com).

The Study Group Directory is a work in progress and more useful features will be added as we move forward in our organizational teamwork. It’s a great start in connecting our global village of active Urantia Book students and your participation assures its continued success!

In spirit of brotherhood,  
Gaetan Charland
