Hello dear readers and friends of the association,

I would first like to thank the members of the association and some readers who were present at the Annual General Meeting held on May 6. At this meeting, there were two positions open for nominations, that of treasurer and that of president. Marc Belleau and I were reappointed to these two positions respectively.

It is always a great honor and privilege to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Quebec. In the universe we inhabit, service is a function that each of us must experience, because without service experience there is little opportunity for growth. When Jesus came to make his final bestowal on our planet, he committed himself throughout his life to loving service to his fellow human beings, and through his life he left us an exemplary way to live ours.

As summer approaches and the holiday season approaches, we can experience service, but in a different way, while making new acquaintances. What could be better than helping a neighbor with their garden or even a stranger who is moving near us by welcoming them and helping them settle in.

Life is full of opportunities to serve in a thousand and one ways, let the heart guide us; it is by this means that the divine Spirit within us inspires us to serve our fellow man and thus contribute to the establishment of human brotherhood. Each of us, readers and students of The Urantia Book, has the responsibility to give back to others what we have so abundantly received. What better way than through service to introduce new contacts and to share in a living way the truth we have found.

At the end of June, the postal address of the association will change, and with us the place of residence of the AUQ head office. You will be informed of the new address. When the change is effective, it will appear on the association's website. Rest assured, postal mail will be forwarded to the new address for a period of at least one year.

Wishing you a summer filled with fruitful encounters, new service opportunities and to take full advantage of this wonderful season to rest and enjoy the benefits that nature offers us.

To love is to serve
