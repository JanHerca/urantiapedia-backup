## Dawn of Eternity

> The First Universe Age [^1] is the first factual age, but behind it is the concept of a Zero Age, an age before the times of (eternal) Havona. The Papers make use of this Zero Concept without actually using the term, “Zero Age”. They speak of “the dawn of eternity,” a hypothetical state of affairs prior to the appearance of the Infinite; Spirit and the central universe. It is this state of affairs that we propose to call the Zero Age. (Thinking about the Zero Age is something like thinking about the zero mark on a ruler. We do not actually measure anything with this mark, but it does show where the first inch starts.)

## Day

> The Satania day equals three days of Urantia time, less one hour, four minutes, and fifteen seconds, that being the time of the axial revolution of Jerusem. <a id="s32_159"></a>[UB 46:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_2)

> The day in Satania, as reckoned on Jerusem, is a little less( 1 hour,4 minutes, 15 seconds) than three days of Urantia time. These times are generally known as Salvington time, and Satania or system time. Standard time is universe time. The standard day of Nebadon is equal to eighteen days and six hours of Urantia time, plus two and one-half minutes. <a id="s34_355"></a>[UB 33:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_9)

## Death

> Mortal death is a technique of escape from the material life in the flesh. <a id="s38_77"></a>[UB 47:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_7)

> Urantians generally recognize only one kind of death, the physical cessation of life energies; but concerning personality survival there are really three kinds:[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_1)
> 
> 1. _Spiritual (soul) death_. If and when mortal man has finally rejected survival, when he has been pronounced spiritually insolvent, morontially bankrupt, in the conjoint opinion of the Adjuster and the surviving seraphim, when such co-ordinate advice has been recorded on Uversa, and after the Censors and their reflective associates have verified these findings, thereupon do the rulers of Orvonton order the immediate release of the indwelling Monitor. But this release of the Adjuster in no way affects the duties of the personal or group seraphim concerned with that Adjuster-abandoned individual. This kind of death is final in its significance irrespective of the temporary continuation of the living energies of the physical and mind mechanisms. >From the cosmic standpoint the mortal is already dead; the continuing life merely indicates the persistence of the material momentum of cosmic energies.
> 
> 2. _Intellectual (mind) death._ When the vital circuits of higher adjutant ministry are disrupted through the aberrations of intellect or because of the partial destruction of the mechanism of the brain, and if these conditions pass a certain critical point of irreparability, the indwelling Adjuster is immediately released to depart for Divinington.On the universe records a mortal personality is considered to have met with death whenever the essential mind circuits of human will-action have been destroyed. And again, this is death, irrespective of the continuing function of the living mechanism of the physical body. The body minus the volitional mind is no longer human, but according to the prior choosing of the human will, the soul of such an individual may survive.
> 
> 3. _Physical (body and mind) death._ When death overtakes a human being, the Adjuster remains in the citadel of the mind until it ceases to function as an intelligent mechanism, about the time that the measurable brain energies cease their rhythmic vital pulsations. Following this dissolution the Adjuster takes leave of the vanishing mind, just as unceremoniously as entry was made years before, and proceeds to Divinington by way of Uversa. <a id="s46_446"></a>[UB 112:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_1)

> After death the material body returns to the elemental world from which it was derived, but two nonmaterial factors of surviving personality persists: The pre-existent Thought Adjuster, with the memory transcription of the mortal career, Proceeds to Divinington; and there also remains, in the custody of the destiny guardian, the immortal morontial soul of the deceased human. These phases and forms of soul, these once kinetic but now static formulas of identity, are essential to repersonalization on the morontia worlds; and it the reunion of the Adjuster and the soul that reassembles the surviving personality, that reconsciousizes you at the time of the morontia awakening. <a id="s48_683"></a>[UB 112:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_5)

> For those who do not have personal seraphic guardians, the group custodians faithfully and efficiently perform the same service of identity safekeeping and personality resurrection. The seraphim are indispensable to the reassembly of personality.
> 
> Upon death the Thought Adjuster temporarily loses personality, but not identity; the human subject temporarily loses identity, but not personality; on the mansion worlds both reunite in eternal manifestation. Never does a departed Thought Adjuster return to earth as the being of former indwelling; never is personality manifested without the human will; and never does a dis-Adjustered human being after death manifest active identity or in any manner establish communication with the living beings of earth. Such dis-Adjustered souls are wholly and absolutely unconscious during the long or short sleep of death. There can be no exhibition of any sort of personality or ability to engage in communications with other personalities until after completion of survival. Those who go to the mansion worlds are not permitted to send messages back to their loved ones. It is the policy throughout the universes to forbid such communication during the period of a current dispensation. <a id="s52_983"></a>[UB 112:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_5)

> When death of a material, intellectual, or spiritual nature occurs, the Adjuster bids farewell to the mortal host and departs for Divinington. <a id="s54_145"></a>[UB 112:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p4_1)

> Death is, ordinarily, a part of life. Death is the last act in the mortal drama. <a id="s56_83"></a>[UB 188:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_2)

## Defeat

> Defeat is the true mirror in which you may honestly view your real self. <a id="s60_75"></a>[UB 156:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_17)

## Deity

> Deity is personalizable as God, is prepersonal and superpersonal in ways not altogether comprehensible by man. Deity is characterized by the quality of unity—actual or potential—on all supermaterial levels of reality; and this unifying quality is best comprehended by creatures as divinity. <a id="s64_293"></a>[UB 0:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_2)

> Deity is the source of all that which is divine. Deity is characteristically and invariably divine, but all that which is divine is not necessarily Deity, though it will be co-ordinated with Deity and will tend towards some phase of unity with Deity—spiritual, mindal, or personal. <a id="s66_284"></a>[UB 0:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_15)

## Democracy

> Men have also made a fetish of democracy, the exultation and adoration of the common man’s ideas when collectively called public opinion.” One man’s opinion, when taken by itself is not regarded as worth much, but when many men are collectively functioning as a democracy, this same mediocre judgment is held to be the arbiter of justice and the standard of righteousness. <a id="s70_375"></a>[UB 88:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p3_4)

## Destiny, spiritual

> Spiritual destiny is dependent on faith, love,and devotion to truth—hunger and thirst for righteousness—the wholehearted desire to find God and to be like him. <a id="s74_162"></a>[UB 156:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_7)

## Devil

> The “devil” is none other than Caligastia, the deposed Planetary Prince of Urantia and a Son of the secondary order of Lanonandeks. At the time Michael was on Urantia in the flesh, Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia were leagued together to effect the miscarriage of his bestowal mission. But they signally failed. <a id="s78_313"></a>[UB 53:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_4)

## Divinity

> Divinity is the characteristic, unifying, and co-ordinating quality of Deity. Divinity is creature comprehensible as truth, beauty, and goodness; correlated in personality as love, mercy, and ministry; disclosed on impersonal levels as Justice, power, and sovereignty.
> 
> Divinity may be perfect—complete—as on existential and creator levels of Paradise perfection; it may be imperfect, as on experiential and creature levels of time—space evolution; or it may be relative, neither perfect not imperfect, as on certain Havona levels of existential-experiential relationships. <a id="s84_306"></a>[UB 0:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_17)

## Divorce

> It is also unfortunate that certain groups of mortals have conceived of marriage as being consummated by divine action. Such beliefs lead directly to the concept of the indissolubility of the marital state regardless of the circumstances or the wishes of the contracting parties. But the very fact of marriage dissolution itself indicates that Deity is not a conjoining party to such unions. If God has once joined any two things or persons together, they will remain thus joined until such a time as the divine will decrees their separation. But, regarding marriage, which is a human institution, who shall presume to sit in judgment, to say which marriages are unions that might be approved by the universe supervisors in contrast with those which are purely human in nature and origin? <a id="s88_791"></a>[UB 83:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_4)

## Doctrine

> In olden times the fetish word of authority was a fear-inspiring _doctrine_, the most terrible of all tyrants which enslave men. A doctrinal fetish will lead mortal man to betray himself into the clutches of bigotry, fanaticism, superstition, intolerance, and the most atrocious of barbarous cruelties. Modern respect for wisdom and truth is but the recent escape from the fetish—making tendency up to the higher levels of thinking and reasoning. Concerning the accumulated fetish writings which various religionists hold as sacred books, it is not only believed that what is in the book is true, but also that every truth is contained in the book. If one of these sacred books happens to speak of the earth as being flat, then, for long generations, otherwise sane men and women will refuse to accept positive evidence that the planet is round. <a id="s92_848"></a>[UB 88:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p2_7)

## Dogmatism

> Sectarianism is a disease of institutional religion, and dogmatism is an enslavement of the spiritual nature. It is far better to have a religion without a church than a church without religion. <a id="s96_197"></a>[UB 99:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_1)

## Duty

> (as a level of reality) The reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination. <a id="s100_203"></a>[UB 16:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_7)
