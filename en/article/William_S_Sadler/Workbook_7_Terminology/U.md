## Ultimata

_Gravity Stages ( Energy)_. This modification of the force-charge of space is produced by the action of the Paradise force organizers. It signalizes the appearance of energy systems responsive to the null of paradise gravity. This emergent energy is originally neutral but consequent upon further metamorphosis will exhibit the so-called negative and positive qualities. We designate these stages Ultimata. <a id="s28_407"></a>[UB 11:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_6)

> Puissant and gravity energies, when regarded collectively are spoken of on Uversa as ULTIMATA. <a id="s30_97"></a>[UB 42:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_13)

## Understanding

> The impulse of co-ordination, the spontaneous and apparently automatic association of ideas. This is the gift of the co-ordination of acquired knowledge, the phenomenon of quick reasoning, rapid judgment, and prompt decision. <a id="s34_228"></a>[UB 36:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_7)

> Recognition is the intellectual process of fitting the sensory impressions received from the external world into the memory patterns of the individual. Understanding connotes that these recognized sensory impressions and their associated memory patterns have become integrated or organized into a dynamic network of principles. <a id="s36_330"></a>[UB 111:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_1)

## Unions of Days

> The Paradise advisers to the rulers of the local universes. <a id="s40_62"></a>[UB 15:10.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p10_16)

## Universal Father

> God—the Universal Father—is the personality of the First Source and Center and as such maintains personal relations of Infinite control over all co-ordinate and subordinate sources and centers. <a id="s44_196"></a>[UB 0:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_10)

> The Universal Father is the secret of the reality of personality, the bestowal of personality, and the destiny of personality. <a id="s46_129"></a>[UB 0:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_5)

> The Universal Father is the God of all creation, the First Source and Center of all things and beings. First think of God as a creator, then as a controller, and lastly as an infinite upholder. <a id="s48_196"></a>[UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)

> The Universal Father is absolutely and without qualification infinite in all his attributes; and this fact, in and of itself, automatically shuts him off from all direct personal communication with finite material beings and other lowly created intelligences. <a id="s50_262"></a>[UB 2:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p1_6)

> The Universal Father never personally functions as a creator except in conjunction with the Son or with the co-ordinate action of the Son. <a id="s52_141"></a>[UB 6:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p1_3)

## Universe Age

> There is another concept [^1] presented in the Papers that we will find most useful; this is the concept of the six successive universe ages. The Papers present each universe age as a period of time that is associated with the opening and the development of a new space level. This relationship is presented in the following tabulation:

| **The Universe Age** | **The New Space Level Involved** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1- The First Universe Age | The Havona Space Level |
| 1- The Second Universe Age | The Superuniverse Space Level |
| 2- The Third Universe Age | The Primary Space Level |
| 3- The Fourth Universe Age | The Secondary Space Level |
| 4- The Fifth Universe Age | The Tertiary Space Level |
| 5- The Sixth Universe Age | The Quartan Space Level |

## Universe of Universes

> The universe of universes is one vast integrated mechanism which is absolutely controlled by one infinite mind. <a id="s69_114"></a>[UB 56:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p0_1)

## Univitatia

> Univitatia are the permanent citizens of Edentia and its associated worlds, all seven hundred seventy worlds surrounding the constellation headquarters being under their supervision. These children of the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit are projected on a plane of existence in between the material and the spiritual, but they are not morontia creatures. <a id="s73_361"></a>[UB 43:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p7_1)

## Unpervaded space

“Unpervaded” space means: unpervaded by those forces, energies, powers, and presences known to exist in pervaded space. <a id="s77_120"></a>[UB 11:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_3)

## Unselfishness

> The spirit of self-forgetfulness. <a id="s81_36"></a>[UB 3:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_13)

## Urantia

> Urantia—that being the name of your world. <a id="s85_45"></a>[UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1)

## Utopia, evolutionary

> This epoch of the Teacher Sons is the vestibule to the final planetary age—evolutionary utopia—the age of light and life. <a id="s89_124"></a>[UB 49:5.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_27)
