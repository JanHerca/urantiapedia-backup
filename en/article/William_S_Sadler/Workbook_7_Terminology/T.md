## Tact

> As you grow older in years and more experienced in the affairs of the kingdom, are you becoming more tactful in dealing with troublesome mortals and more tolerant in living with stubborn associates? Tact is the fulcrum of social leverage, and tolerance is the earmark of a great soul. If you possess these rare and charming gifts, as the days pass you will become more alert and expert in your worthy efforts to avoid all unnecessary social misunderstandings. Such wise souls are able to avoid much of the trouble which is certain to be the portion of all who suffer from lack of emotional adjustment, those who refuse to grow up, and those who refuse to grow old gracefully. <a id="s28_678"></a>[UB 156:5.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_18)

## Theology

> That religionists have believed so much that was false does not invalidate religion because religion is founded on the recognition of values and is validated by the faith of personal religious experience. Religion, then, is based on experience and religious thought; theology, the philosophy of religion, is an honest attempt to interpret that experience. Such interpretative beliefs may be right or wrong, or a mixture of truth and error. <a id="s32_442"></a>[UB 103:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_5)

> Theology is the study of the actions and reactions of the human spirit; it can never become a science since it must always be combined more or less with psychology in its personal expression and with philosophy in its systematic portrayal. Theology is always the study of your religion; the study of another’s religion is psychology. <a id="s34_336"></a>[UB 103:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_1)

## Thor

> The decisive struggles between the white man and the blue man were fought out in the valley of the Somme. Here the flower of the blue race bitterly contested the southward moving Andites, and for over five hundred years these Cro-Magnoids successfully defended their territories before succumbing to the superior military strategy of the white invaders. Thor, the victorious commander of the armies of the north in the final battle of the Somme, became the hero of the northern tribes and later on was revered as a god by some of them. <a id="s38_538"></a>[UB 80:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p5_4)

## Thought Adjuster

> The Thought Adjuster is the cosmic window through which the finite creature may faith-glimpse the certainties and divinities of limitless Deity, the Universal Father. <a id="s42_169"></a>[UB 103:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p0_1)

> It is the Adjuster who creates within man that unquenchable yearning and incessant longing to be like God, to attain Paradise, and there before the actual person of Deity to worship the infinite source of the divine gift. The Adjuster is the living presence which actually links the mortal son with his Paradise Father and draws him nearer and nearer to the father. The Adjuster is our compensatory equalization of the enormous universe tension which is created by the distance of man’s removal from God and by the degree of his partiality in contrast with the universality of the eternal Father.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_5)

> The Adjuster is an absolute essence of an infinite being imprisoned within the mind of a finite creature which, depending on the choosing of such a mortal, can eventually consummate this temporary union of God and man and veritably actualize a new order of being for unending universe service. The Adjuster is the divine universe reality which factualizes the truth that God is man’s Father. The Adjuster is man’s infallible cosmic compass, always and unerringly pointing the soul Godward. <a id="s46_492"></a>[UB 107:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_5)

> The Adjusters are the actuality of the Father’s love incarnate in the souls of men; they are the veritable promise of man’s eternal career imprisoned within the mortal mind; .they are the essence of man’s perfected finaliter personality, which he can foretaste in time as he progressively masters the divine technique of achieving the living of the Father’s will, step by step, through the ascension of universe upon universe until he actually attains the divine presence of his Paradise Father. <a id="s48_498"></a>[UB 107:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_2)

> Together with their many unrevealed associates, the Adjusters are undiluted and unmixed divinity, unqualified and unattenuated parts of Deity; they are of God, and as far as we are able to discern, _they are God._ <a id="s50_216"></a>[UB 107:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_2)

> The Adjuster is man’s eternity possibility, man is the Adjusters personality possibility. <a id="s52_92"></a>[UB 107:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_2)

> Thought Adjusters are not personalities, but they are real entities; they are truly and perfectly individualized, although they are never, while indwelling mortals, actually personalized. Thought Adjusters are not true personalities; the are _true realities_, realities of the purest order known in the universe of universes—they are the divine presence. <a id="s54_357"></a>[UB 107:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_1)

> The Adjuster is the wellspring of spiritual attainment and the hope of divine character within you. He is the power, privilege, and the possibility of survival, which so fully and forever distinguishes you from mere animal creatures, he is the higher and truly internal spiritual stimulus of thought in contrast with the external and physical stimulus, which reaches the mind over the nerve-energy mechanism of the material body.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_4)

> These faithful custodians of the future career unfailingly duplicate every mental creation with a spiritual counterpart: they are thus slowly and surely re-creating you as you really are(only spiritually) for resurrection on the survival worlds. And all of these exquisite spirit re-creations are being preserved; in the emerging reality of your evolving and immortal soul, your morontia self. These realities are actually there, notwithstanding that the Adjuster is seldom able to exalt these duplicate creations sufficiently to exhibit then to the light of consciousness.

> And as you are the human parent, so is the Adjuster the divine parent of the real you, your higher and advancing self, your better morontial and future spiritual self. And it is this evolving morontial soul that the judges and censors discern when they decree your survival and pass you upward to new worlds, and never ending existence in eternal liaison with your faithful partner—God, the Adjuster.

> The Adjusters are the eternal ancestors, the divine originals, of your evolving immortal souls; they are the unceasing urge that leads man to attempt the mastery of the material and present existence in the light of the spiritual and future career. The Monitors are the prisoners of undying hope, the founts of everlasting progression. And how they do enjoy communicating with their subjects in more or less direct channels! How they rejoice when they can dispense with symbols and other methods of indirection and flash their messages straight to the intellects of their human partners! <a id="s62_590"></a>[UB 108:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_4)

> Material evolution has provided you a life machine, your body; the Father himself has endowed you with the purest spirit reality known in the universe, your Thought Adjuster. But into your hands, subject to your own decision’s, has been given mind, and it is by mind that you live or die. It is within this mind and with this mind that you make those moral decisions which enable you to Achieve Adjusterlikeness, and that is Godlikeness. <a id="s64_440"></a>[UB 111:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_4)

> Mind is your ship, the Adjuster is your pilot, the human will is captain. The master of the mortal vessel should have the wisdom to trust the divine pilot to guide the ascending soul into the morontia harbors of eternal survival. <a id="s66_232"></a>[UB 111:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_9)

## Time

> Only by ubiquity could Deity unify time-space manifestations to the finite conception, for time is a succession of instants while space is a system of associated points. You do, after all, perceive time by analysis and space by synthesis. <a id="s70_241"></a>[UB 118:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_1)

> Time is the stream of flowing temporal events perceived by creature consciousness. Time is a name given to the succession arrangement whereby events are recognized and segregated. The universe of space is a time-related phenomenon as it is viewed from any interior position outside of the fixed abode of Paradise. The motion of time is only revealed in relation to something which does not move in space as a time phenomenon. In the universe of universes Paradise and its Deities transcend both time and space. In the inhabited worlds, human personality (indwelt and oriented by the Paradise Father’s spirit) is the only physically related reality which can transcend the material sequence of temporal events.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p7_4)

> Animals do not sense time as does man, and even to man, because of his sectional and circumscribed view, time appears as a succession of events; but as man ascends, as he progresses inward, the enlarging view of this event procession is such that it is discerned more and more in its wholeness. That which formerly appeared as a succession of events then will be viewed as a whole and perfectly related cycle; in this way will circular simultaneity increasingly displace the onetime consciousness of the linear sequence of events. <a id="s74_533"></a>[UB 130:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p7_4)

> Mankind is slow to perceive that, in all that is personal, matter is the skeleton of morontia, and that both are the reflected shadow of enduring spirit reality. How long before you will regard time as the moving image of eternity and space as the fleeting shadow of Paradise realities? <a id="s76_289"></a>[UB 189:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_3)

## Totemism

> Totemism is a combination of social and religious observances. Originally it was thought that respect for the totem animal of supposed biologic origin insured the food supply. Totems were at one and the same time symbols of the group and their god. Such a god was the clan personified. Totemism was one phase of the attempted socialization of otherwise personal religion. The totem eventually evolved into the flag, or national symbol, of the various modern peoples. <a id="s80_469"></a>[UB 88:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p3_2)

## Tranosta

> _Transcendental energy_. This energy system operates on and from the upper level of Paradise and only in connection with the absonite peoples. On Uversa it is denominated TRANOSTA. <a id="s84_183"></a>[UB 42:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_18)

## Trinitization

> Trinitization [^1] has a special meaning in the Papers. As we are using it here it means a “once only” act of creation- “limited trinitization.” The trinitizing partners put everything they have into this action; they produce a being equal to themselves, and they become united in some manner. This type of trinitization cannot be repeated.

## Trinity, Absolute

> _The Absolute Trinity_—the second experiential Trinity—now in process of actualization, will consist of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and the unrevealed Consummator of Universe Destiny. This Trinity functions on both personal and superpersonal levels, even to the borders of the nonpersonal, and its unification in universality would experientialize Absolute Deity. <a id="s92_373"></a>[UB 0:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_7)

## Trinity, Paradise

> _The Paradise Trinity_—the eternal Deity union of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit—is existential in actuality, but all potentials are experiential. Therefore does this Trinity constitute the only Deity reality embracing infinity, and therefore do there occur the universe phenomena of the actualization of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and God the Absolute. <a id="s96_396"></a>[UB 0:12.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_2)

## Trinity, Ultimate

> _The Ultimate Trinity_, now evolving, will eventually consist of the Supreme Being, the Supreme Creator Personalities, and the absonite Architects of the Master Universe, those unique universe planners who are neither creators not creatures. God the Ultimate will eventually and inevitably powerize and personalize as the Deity consequence of the unification of this experiential Ultimate Trinity in the expanding arena of the well-nigh limitless master universe. <a id="s100_466"></a>[UB 0:12.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_6)

## Truth

> Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. <a id="s104_114"></a>[UB 2:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_2)

> Truth is beautiful because it is both replete and symmetrical. When man searches for truth, he pursues the divinely real. <a id="s106_124"></a>[UB 2:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_4)

> Divine truth is best known by its spiritual flavor. <a id="s108_54"></a>[UB 2:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_6)

> Truth is the basis of science and philosophy, presenting the intellectual foundation of religion. <a id="s110_100"></a>[UB 56:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_10)

> However wise it may be to glean wisdom from the past, it is folly to regard the past as the exclusive source of truth. Truth is relative and expanding; it _lives_ always in the present, achieving new expression in each generation of men—even in each human life. <a id="s112_264"></a>[UB 79:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_8)

> The truth—an understanding of cosmic relationships, universe facts, and spiritual values—can best be had through the ministry of the Spirit of Truth and can best be criticized by revelation. But revelation originates neither a science nor a religion; its function is to co-ordinate both science and religion with the truth of reality. <a id="s114_337"></a>[UB 103:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_8)

> Things are time conditioned, but truth is timeless. The more truth you know, the more truth you are, the more of the past you can understand and of the future you can comprehend.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_2)

> Truth is inconcussible—forever exempt from all transient vicissitudes, albeit never dead and formal, always vibrant and adaptable—radiantly alive. But when truth becomes linked with fact, then both time and space condition its meanings and correlate its values. Such realities of truth wedded to fact become concepts and are accordingly relegated to the domain of relative cosmic realities. <a id="s118_393"></a>[UB 118:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_2)

> Truth cannot be defined with words, only by living. Truth is always more than knowledge. Knowledge pertains to things observed, but truth transcends such purely material levels in that it consorts with wisdom and embraces such imponderables as human experience even spiritual and living realities. Knowledge originates in science; wisdom, in true philosophy; truth, in the religious experience of spiritual living. Knowledge deals with facts; wisdom with relationships: truth, with reality values. <a id="s120_500"></a>[UB 132:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_2)

> Revealed truth, personally discovered truth, is the supreme delight of the human soul. <a id="s122_89"></a>[UB 132:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_4)

> Divine truth is a spirit-discerned and living reality. Truth exists only on high spiritual levels of the realization of divinity and the consciousness of communion with God. You can know the truth, and you can live the truth; you can experience the growth of truth in the soul and enjoy the liberty of its enlightenment in the mind, but you cannot imprison truth in formulas, codes, creeds, or intellectual patterns of human conduct. When you undertake the human formulation of divine truth, it speedily dies. <a id="s124_512"></a>[UB 180:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_2)

> Truth often becomes confusing and even misleading when it is dismembered, segregated, isolated, and too much analyzed. Living truth teaches the truth seeker aright only when it is embraced in wholeness and as a living spiritual reality, not as a fact of material science or an inspiration of intervening art. <a id="s126_311"></a>[UB 195:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_2)
