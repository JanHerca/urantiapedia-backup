## Happiness

> Happiness ensues from the recognition of of truth because it can be _acted out_; it can be lived. Disappointment and sorrow attend upon error because, not being a reality, it cannot be realized in experience.Divine truth is best known by its _spiritual flavor_. <a id="s28_264"></a>[UB 2:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_6)

> Human happiness is achieved only when the ego desire of the self and the altruistic urge of the higher self (divine spirit) are co-ordinated and reconciled by the unified will of the integrating and supervising personality. <a id="s30_226"></a>[UB 103:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_5)

## Harmony

> Harmony is the keynote of the central Universe, and detectable order prevails on Paradise. <a id="s34_93"></a>[UB 27:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p4_2)

## Harp of God

> John the revelator saw a vision of the arrival of a class of advancing mortals from the seventh mansion world to their first heaven, the glories of Jerusem. He recorded: “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those who had gained the victory over the beast that was originally in them and over the image that persisted through the mansion worlds and finally over the last mark and trace, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God, and singing the song of deliverance from mortal fear and death.” (Perfected space communication is to be had on all these worlds; and your anywhere reception of such communications is made possible by carrying the “harp of God,” a morontia contrivance compensating for the inability to directly adjust the immature, morontia sensory mechanism to the reception of space communications.) <a id="s38_852"></a>[UB 47:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_2)

## Hate

> Hate is the shadow of fear; revenge the mask of cowardice. <a id="s42_61"></a>[UB 145:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_4)

## Havona

_Havona,_ the central universe, is not a time creation; it is an eternal existence. This never-beginning, never-ending universe consists of one billion spheres of sublime perfection and is surrounded by the enormous dark gravity bodies. At the center of Havona is the stationary and absolutely stabilized Isle of Paradise, surrounded by its twenty-one satellites. Owing to the enormous encircling masses of the dark, gravity bodies about the fringe of the central universe, the mass content of this central creation is far in excess of the total known mass of all seven sectors of the grand universe. <a id="s46_601"></a>[UB 12:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_10)

## Heaven

> You should consider the statement about “heaven” and the “heaven of heavens.” The heaven conceived by most of your prophets was the first of the mansion worlds of the local system. When the apostle spoke of being “caught up to the third heaven,” he referred to that experience in which his Adjuster was detached during sleep and in this unusual state made a projection to the third of the seven mansion worlds. Some of your wise men saw the vision of the greater heaven, “the heaven of heavens,” of which the sevenfold mansion world experience was but the first; the second being Jerusem; the third, Edentia and its satellites; the fourth, Salvington and the surrounding educational spheres; the fifth, Uversa; the sixth, Havona and the seventh, Paradise. <a id="s50_758"></a>[UB 48:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_23)

## Heaven, kingdom of

> The kingdom of heaven, the divine government, is founded on the fact of divine sovereignty—God is spirit. Since God is spirit, this kingdom is spiritual. The kingdom of heaven is neither material nor merely intellectual; it is a spiritual relationship between God and man. <a id="s54_275"></a>[UB 134:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_2)

## Holy Spirit

> In your sacred writings the term _Spirit of God_ seems to be used interchangeably to designate both the Infinite Spirit on Paradise and the Creative Spirit of your local universe. The Holy Spirit is the spiritual circuit of this Creative Daughter of the paradise Infinite Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a circuit indigenous to each local universe and is confined to the spiritual realm of that creation; but the Infinite Spirit is omnipresent. <a id="s58_442"></a>[UB 8:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p5_3)

> The bestowal of the ministry spirit of a local universe Creative Spirit, known on Urantia as the Holy Spirit. <a id="s60_112"></a>[UB 16:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p4_13)

## Home

> Marriage—mating—grows out of bisexuality. Marriage is man’s reactional adjustment to such bisexuality, while family life is the sum total resulting from all such evolutionary and adaptative adjustments. Marriage is enduring, it is not inherent in biologic evolution, but it is the basis of all social evolution and is therefore certain of continued existence in some form. Marriage has given mankind the home, and the home is the crowning glory of the whole long and arduous evolutionary struggle. <a id="s64_500"></a>[UB 82:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_1)

> The home is the natural social arena wherein the ethics of blood brotherhood may be grasped by the growing children. The family Is the fundamental unit of fraternity in which parents and children learn those lessons of patience, altruism, tolerance, and forbearance which are so essential to the realization of brotherhood among all men. <a id="s66_340"></a>[UB 84:7.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_28)

## Hope

> Is _hope_—the grandeur of trust—desirable? Then human existence must constantly be confronted with insecurities and recurrent uncertainties. <a id="s70_143"></a>[UB 3:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_8)

## Humor

> When we are tempted to magnify our self-importance, if we stop to contemplate the infinity of the greatness and grandeur of our Makers, our own self-glorification becomes sublimely ridiculous, even verging on the humorous. One of the functions of humor is to help all of us take ourselves less seriously. _Humor is the divine antidote for exultation of ego._ <a id="s74_361"></a>[UB 48:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_15)
