## War

> War is the natural state and heritage of evolving man; peace is the social yardstick measuring civilization’s advancement. <a id="s28_125"></a>[UB 70:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_1)

> War is an animalistic reaction to misunderstandings and irritations; peace attends upon the civilized solution of all such problems and difficulties. <a id="s30_152"></a>[UB 70:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_2)

> In past ages a fierce war would institute social changes and facilitate the adoption of new ideas such as would not have occurred naturally in ten thousand years. The terrible price paid for these certain war advantages was that society was temporarily thrown back into savagery; civilized reason had to abdicate, war is strong medicine, very costly and most dangerous; while often curative of certain social disorders, it sometimes kills the patient, destroys the society. <a id="s32_476"></a>[UB 70:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_1)

> War has had a certain evolutionary and selective value, but like slavery, it must sometime be abandoned as civilization slowly advances. <a id="s34_139"></a>[UB 70:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_9)

> Ancient warfare resulted in the decimation of inferior peoples; the net result of modern conflict is the selective destruction of the best human stocks. <a id="s36_155"></a>[UB 70:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_9)

> Do not make the mistake of glorifying war. <a id="s38_45"></a>[UB 70:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_19)

## Will

> Human will—the ability to know God and the power of choosing to worship him. <a id="s42_79"></a>[UB 65:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p0_6)

> The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative. The will of man is the way of man, the sum and substance of that which the mortal chooses to be and do. Will is the deliberate choice of a self-conscious being which leads to decision-conduct based on intelligent reflection. <a id="s44_339"></a>[UB 130:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_7)

> Will is that manifestation of the human mind which enables the subjective consciousness to express itself objectively. and to experience the phenomenon of aspiring to be Godlike. <a id="s46_181"></a>[UB 130:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_10)

## Wisdom

> Wisdom is twofold in origin, being derived from the perfection of divine insight inherent in perfect beings and from the personal experience acquired by evolutionary creatures. <a id="s50_179"></a>[UB 19:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p2_4)

> The inherent tendency of all moral creatures towards orderly and progressive evolutionary advancement. <a id="s52_105"></a>[UB 36:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_12)

> Even wisdom is divine and safe only when it is cosmic in scope and spiritual in motivation. <a id="s54_94"></a>[UB 54:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_7)

> Knowledge can be had by education, but wisdom, which is indispensable to true culture, can be secured only through experience and by men and women who are innately intelligent. Such a people are able to learn from experience; they may become truly wise. <a id="s56_256"></a>[UB 81:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_13)

> Knowledge leads to placing men, to originating social strata and castes; Religion leads to serving men, thus creating ethics and altruism. Wisdom leads, to the higher and better fellowship of both ideas and one’s fellows. Revelation liberates men and starts them out on the eternal adventure. <a id="s58_295"></a>[UB 102:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_6)

> The career of a God-seeking man may prove to be a great success in the light of eternity, even though the whole temporal-life enterprise may appear as an overwhelming failure, provided each life failure yielded the culture of wisdom and spirit achievement. Do not make the mistake of confusing knowledge, culture, and wisdom. They are related in life, but they represent vastly differing spirit values; wisdom ever dominates knowledge and always glorifies culture. <a id="s60_467"></a>[UB 160:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_16)

## Work

> It is not so much what you learn in this first life; it is the experience of living this life that is important. Even the _work_ of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important as the _way_ in which you do this work. <a id="s64_237"></a>[UB 39:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13)

## World

> Jesus hardly regarded this world as a “vale of tears.” He rather looked upon it as the birth sphere of the eternal and immortal spirits of paradise ascension, the “vale of soul making”. <a id="s68_188"></a>[UB 149:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p5_5)

## Worship

> Worship—the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, the recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination. <a id="s72_390"></a>[UB 16:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_8)

> Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures. The quality of worship is determined by the depth of creature perception; and as the knowledge of the infinite character of the Gods progresses, the act of worship becomes increasingly all-encompassing until it eventually attains the glory of the highest experiential delight and the most exquisite pleasure known to created beings. <a id="s74_590"></a>[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1)

> _Worship is the highest joy of Paradise existence_; it is the refreshing play of Paradise. What play does for your jaded minds on earth, worship will do for your, perfected souls on Paradise. The mode of worship on Paradise is utterly beyond mortal comprehension, but the spirit of it you can begin to appreciate even down here on Urantia, for the spirits of the Gods even now indwell you, hover over you, and inspire you to true worship. <a id="s76_441"></a>[UB 27:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_5)

> Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver. <a id="s78_101"></a>[UB 16:8.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_14)

> Worship is the badge of spiritual-ascension candidacy. <a id="s80_57"></a>[UB 36:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_11)

> Worship—contemplation of the spiritual—must alternate with service, contact with material reality. <a id="s82_101"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3)

> Worship is intended to anticipate the better life ahead and, then to reflect these new spiritual significances back onto the life which now is. Prayer is spiritually sustaining, but worship is divinely creative.[](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_5)

> Worship is the technique of looking to the One for the inspiration of service to the many. Worship is the yardstick which measures the extent of the soul’s detachment from the material universe and its simultaneous and secure attachment to the spiritual realities of all creation.

> Prayer is self-reminding—sublime thinking; worship is self-forgetting—superthinking. Worship is effortless attention, true and ideal soul rest, a form of restful spiritual exertion.

> Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the whole; the finite with the infinite; the son with the Father; time in the act of striking step with eternity. Worship is the act of the son’s personal communion with the divine Father, the assumption of refreshing, creative, fraternal, and romantic attitudes by the human soul-spirit. <a id="s90_344"></a>[UB 143:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_5)

> True religious worship is not a futile monologue of self-deception. Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship to be better and thereby eventually attains the _best._ <a id="s92_262"></a>[UB 196:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_22)
