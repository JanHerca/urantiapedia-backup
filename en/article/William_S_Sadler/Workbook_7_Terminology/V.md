## Vanity

> The longing to display one’s property accumulations. <a id="s28_55"></a>[UB 69:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p5_6)

## Violence

> Violence is the law of nature, hostility the automatic reaction of the children of nature, while war is but these same activities carried on collectively. <a id="s32_157"></a>[UB 70:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_1)

## Virtue

> Virtue is righteousness—conformity with the cosmos. To name virtues is not to define them, but to live them is to know them. Virtue is not mere knowledge nor yet wisdom but rather the reality of progressive experience in the attainment of ascending levels of cosmic achievement. In the day by day life of mortal man, virtue is realized by the consistent choosing of ‘good rather then evil, and such choosing ability is evidence of the possession of a moral nature. <a id="s36_467"></a>[UB 16:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_6)

> Supreme virtue, then, is wholeheartedly to choose to do the will of the Father in heaven. <a id="s38_92"></a>[UB 16:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_10)

> Virtue is volitional with personality; righteousness is not automatic in freewill creatures. <a id="s40_95"></a>[UB 21:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p3_14)
