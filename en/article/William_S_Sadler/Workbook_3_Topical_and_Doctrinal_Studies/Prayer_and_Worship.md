## I. NATURE WORSHIP

1. Early worship was suggested by nature objects close at hand. <a id="s28_64"></a>[UB 85:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p0_2)
2. Man has worshipped everything on the face of the earth—including himself. <a id="s29_77"></a>[UB 85:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p0_4)
3. The first object of worship was a stone. <a id="s30_44"></a>[UB 85:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p1_1)

8. Fire was long worshipped. <a id="s35_29"></a>[UB 85:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p4_4)

## II. CHANCE AND LUCK

1. Early man lived in fear of chance—existence was a gamble. <a id="s40_61"></a>[UB 86:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p1_4)
2. Even the wise man said: “The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.” <a id="s41_89"></a>[UB 86:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p1_6)
3. The savage personalized everything—both nature and chance. <a id="s42_62"></a>[UB 86:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_3)

5. The savage willingly paid the premiums of fear and priest gifts toward his magic insurance against bad luck. <a id="s44_112"></a>[UB 86:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p7_1)

## III. THE GHOST CULT

1. Ghost fear was the fountainhead of world religion. <a id="s49_54"></a>[UB 87:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_1)
2. Men viewed ghosts as having unlimited rights but no duties. <a id="s50_63"></a>[UB 87:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_1)
3. Self-deprecation was an effort to avoid ghost jealousy. All this led to civilized modesty and restraint. <a id="s51_108"></a>[UB 87:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_7)
4. The effort to placate ghosts and bribe spirits led to a world philosophy. <a id="s52_77"></a>[UB 87:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_9)
5. The ghost cult rendered ancestor worship inevitable. <a id="s53_56"></a>[UB 87:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_1)

## IV. DEATH FEAR

1. To primitive man, death was a shocking combination of chance and mystery. <a id="s58_77"></a>[UB 86:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p3_1)
2. Dreams gave origin to the belief in a future life. <a id="s59_54"></a>[UB 86:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_2)
3. The ghost cult led to the belief in recurring incarnations. <a id="s60_63"></a>[UB 86:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_5)
4. Death was feared, because it released another ghost to be contended with. <a id="s61_77"></a>[UB 87:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_1)
5. The funeral service was an effort to get rid of the ghost. <a id="s62_62"></a>[UB 87:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_3)
6. Man inherited a natural environment, acquired a social environment, and imagined a ghost environment. The state is man’s reaction to natural environment, the home to his social environment, the church to his illusory ghost environment. <a id="s63_239"></a>[UB 86:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p6_1)

## V. FETISHES, MAGIC, AND CHARMS

3. Belief in relics is an outgrowth of the fetish cult. <a id="s69_56"></a>[UB 88:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p2_1)

5. Magic still lingers—many fossil words afford evidence—spellbound, entrancing, and astonished. <a id="s71_97"></a>[UB 88:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_7)
6. Ancient magic was the cocoon of modern science. <a id="s72_51"></a>[UB 88:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_8)

## VI. SACRAMENTS AND RITUALS

1. Salvation depended on vows, oaths, pledges, fasting, and prayer. Then came self-denial, suffering, and deprivation. <a id="s76_119"></a>[UB 87:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_16)
2. The cult of sacrifice evolved into the cult of sacrament. <a id="s77_61"></a>[UB 89:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p9_4)
3. Religious observances evolved through placation, avoidance, exorcism, coercion, conciliation, and propitiation to sacrifice, atonement, and redemption. <a id="s78_155"></a>[UB 90:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p0_1)
4. Ritual sanctifies custom and perpetuates myths. <a id="s79_51"></a>[UB 90:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p5_2)

## VII. EVOLVING PRAYER

1. The first prayers were not addressed to God—they were like saying: “Wish me luck.” <a id="s85_86"></a>[UB 91:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_2)
2. With the coming of God-consciousness, these petitions attained the level of prayer. <a id="s86_87"></a>[UB 91:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_3)
3. Man prayed before he knew God—when in need or when jubilant. <a id="s87_64"></a>[UB 91:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_1)
4. Primitive prayer was bargaining, argument, with the gods. <a id="s88_61"></a>[UB 89:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p8_8)

1. Prayer is communion between man and his Maker. <a id="s94_50"></a>[UB 91:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_5)
2. It is impossible to separate the psychological and spiritual aspects of prayer. <a id="s95_83"></a>[UB 91:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_6)
3. Prayer can never be ethical when the petitioner seeks selfish advantage over his fellows. <a id="s96_93"></a>[UB 91:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_1)
4. Prayer must not be so prostituted as to become a substitute for action. <a id="s97_75"></a>[UB 91:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_2)
5. Prayer does not change God, but it may effect great changes in the one who prays. <a id="s98_85"></a>[UB 91:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p4_5)
6. Prayer is a sure cure for the habit of criticizing others. <a id="s99_62"></a>[UB 91:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p5_3)

3. Worship asks nothing for the worshiper. <a id="s109_43"></a>[UB 5:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_3)
4. From the standpoint of worship, God is one—a unified and personal Deity. <a id="s110_76"></a>[UB 56:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p4_5)
5. Worship is the highest joy of Paradise existence. <a id="s111_53"></a>[UB 27:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_5)
