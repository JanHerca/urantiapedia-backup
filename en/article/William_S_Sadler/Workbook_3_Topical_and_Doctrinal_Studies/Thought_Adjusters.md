## THOUGHT ADJUSTER IN _THE URANTIA BOOK_

### I. ORIGIN OF THOUGHT ADJUSTERS

1. Adjusters proceed direct from the Universal Father.
	> “Though there are diverse opinions regarding the mode of the bestowal of Thought Adjusters, there exist no such differences concerning their origin; all are agreed that they proceed direct from the Universal Father, the First Source and Center. They are not created beings; they are fragmentized entities constituting the factual presence of the infinite God. Together with their many unrevealed associates, the Adjusters are undiluted and unmixed divinity, unqualified and unattenuated parts of Deity; they are of God, and as far as we are able to discern, _they are God_.” <a id="s31_578"></a>[UB 107:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_2)
2. Limited knowledge respecting Adjusters.
	> “As to the time of their beginning separate existences apart from the absoluteness of the First Source and Center, we do not know; neither do we know their number. We know very little concerning their careers until they arrive on the planets of time to indwell human minds, but from that time on we are more or less familiar with their cosmic progressions up to and including the consummation of their triune destinies: attainment of personality by fusion with some mortal ascender, attainment of personality by fiat of the Universal Father, or liberation from the known assignments of Thought Adjusters.” <a id="s33_609"></a>[UB 107:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_3)
3. There is no limit to Adjuster creation.
	> “Although we do not know, we presume that Adjusters are being constantly individualized as the universe enlarges, and as the candidates for Adjuster fusion increase in numbers. But it may be equally possible that we are in error in attempting to assign a numerical magnitude to the Adjusters; like God himself, these fragments of his unfathomable nature may be existentially infinite.” <a id="s35_389"></a>[UB 107:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_4)
4. Technique of Adjuster origin is unrevealed.
	> “The technique of the origin of the Thought Adjusters is one of the unrevealed functions of the Universal Father. We have every reason to believe that none of the other absolute associates of the First Source and Center have aught to do with the production of Father fragments. Adjusters are simply and eternally the divine gifts; they are of God and from God, and they are like God.” <a id="s37_388"></a>[UB 107:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_5)
5. Adjusters are the gift of the absolute God.
	> “In their relationship to fusion creatures they reveal a supernal love and spiritual ministry that is profoundly confirmative of the declaration that God is spirit. But there is much that takes place in addition to this transcendent ministry that has never been revealed to Urantia mortals. Neither do we fully understand just what really transpires when the Universal Father gives of himself to be a part of the personality of a creature of time. Nor has the ascending progression of the Paradise finaliters as yet disclosed the full possibilities inherent in this supernal partnership of man and God. In the last analysis, the Father fragments must be the gift of the absolute God to those creatures whose destiny encompasses the possibility of the attainment of God as absolute.” <a id="s39_786"></a>[UB 107:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_6)

### II. NATURE OF THOUGHT ADJUSTERS

1. Adjusters are absolute essence of infinite Father.
	> “To say that a Thought Adjuster is divine is merely to recognize the nature of origin. It is highly probable that such purity of divinity embraces the essence of the potential of all attributes of Deity which can be contained within such a fragment of the absolute essence of the Universal presence of the eternal and infinite Paradise Father.” <a id="s44_348"></a>[UB 107:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_1)
2. They are qualified absolute fragments of the Father.
	> “The actual source of the Adjuster must be infinite, and before fusion with the immortal soul of an evolving mortal, the reality of the Adjuster must border on absoluteness. Adjusters are not absolutes in the universal sense, in the Deity sense, but they are probably true absolutes within the potentialities of their fragmented nature. They are qualified as to universality but not as to nature; in extensiveness they are limited, but in intensiveness of meaning, value, and fact _they are absolute_. For this reason we sometimes denominate the divine gifts as the qualified absolute fragments of the Father.”  <a id="s46_615"></a>[UB 107:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_2)
3. Adjusters are essence of original Deity.
	> “Since Thought Adjusters are of the essence of original Deity, no one may presume to discourse authoritatively upon their nature and origin; I can only impart the traditions of Salvington and the beliefs of Uversa; I can only explain how we regard these Mystery Monitors and their associated entities throughout the grand universe.” <a id="s48_336"></a>[UB 107:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_1)
4. Adjusters are fragments of prepersonal Deity.
	> “As the Universal Father fragmentizes his prepersonal Deity, so does the Infinite Spirit individuate portions of his premind spirit to indwell and actually to fuse with the evolutionary souls of the surviving mortals of the spirit–fusion series. But the nature of the Eternal Son is not thus fragmentable; the spirit of the Original Son is either diffuse or discretely personal. Son–fused creatures are united with individualized bestowals of the spirit of the Creator Sons of the Eternal Son.” <a id="s50_498"></a>[UB 107:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_7)
5. Adjusters are pure spirit—plus.
	> “As Thought Adjusters are encountered in creature experience, they disclose the presence and leading of a spirit influence. The Adjuster is indeed a spirit, pure spirit, but spirit plus. We have never been able satisfactorily to classify Mystery Monitors; all that can certainly be said of them is that they are truly Godlike.” <a id="s52_331"></a>[UB 107:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_1)
6. Adjusters are pure spirits—presumably absolute.
	> “We know that Thought Adjusters are spirits, pure spirits, presumably absolute spirits. But the Adjuster must also be something more than exclusive spirit reality. In addition to conjectured mindedness, factors of pure energy are also present. If you will remember that God is the source of pure energy and of pure spirit, it will not be so difficult to perceive that his fragments would be both. It is a fact that the Adjusters traverse space over the instantaneous and universal gravity circuits of the Paradise Isle.” <a id="s54_524"></a>[UB 107:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_4)
7. Adjusters are the real mind of God.
	> “Because of the presence in your minds of the Thought Adjuster, it is no more of a mystery for you to know the mind of God than for you to be sure of the consciousness of knowing any other mind, human or superhuman. Religion and social consciousness have this in common: They are predicated on the consciousness of other–mindedness. The technique whereby you can accept another’s idea as yours is the same whereby you may ‘let the mind which was in Christ be also in you.’” <a id="s56_477"></a>[UB 102:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p4_1)
8. Adjuster love is truly divine.
	> “The endowment of imperfect beings with freedom entails inevitable tragedy, and it is the nature of the perfect ancestral Deity to universally and affectionately share these sufferings in loving companionship.
	> 
	> “As far as I am conversant with the affairs of a universe, I regard the love and devotion of a Thought Adjuster as the most truly divine affection in all creation. The love of the Sons in their ministry to the races is superb, but the devotion of an Adjuster to the individual is touchingly sublime, divinely Fatherlike. The Paradise Father has apparently reserved this form of personal contact with his individual creatures as an exclusive Creator prerogative. And there is nothing in all the universe of Universes exactly comparable to the marvelous ministry of these impersonal entities that so fascinatingly indwell the children of the evolutionary planets.” <a id="s60_666"></a>[UB 110:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p0_1)
9. It is believed that Adjusters undergo training.
	> “The valor and wisdom exhibited by Thought Adjusters suggest that they have undergone a training of tremendous scope and range. Since they are not personalities, this training must be imparted in the educational institutions of Divinington. The unique Personalized Adjusters no doubt constitute the personnel of the Adjuster training schools of Divinington. And we do know that this central and supervising corps is presided over by the now Personalized Adjuster of the first Paradise Son of the Michael order to complete his sevenfold bestowal upon the races and peoples of his universe realms.” <a id="s62_600"></a>[UB 107:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p3_9)

10. Adjusters are minded and possess selfhood.
	> “Since Adjusters can plan, work, and love, they must have powers of self–hood which are commensurate with mind. They are possessed of unlimited ability to communicate with each other, that is, all forms of Monitors above the first or virgin groups. As to the nature and purport of their intercommunications, we can reveal very little, for we do not know. And we further know that they must be minded in some manner else they could never be personalized.
	> 
	> “The mindedness of the Thought Adjuster is like the _mindedness_ of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son—that which is ancestral to the _minds_ of the Conjoint Actor.” <a id="s67_175"></a>[UB 107:5.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p5_2)

11. Adjuster is man’s infallible cosmic compass.
	> “The Adjuster is an absolute essence of an infinite being imprisoned within the mind of a finite creature which, depending on the choosing of such a mortal, can eventually consummate this temporary union of God and man and veritably actualize a new order of being for unending universe service. The Adjuster is the divine universe reality which factualizes the truth that God is man's Father. The Adjuster is man's infallible cosmic compass, always and unerringly pointing the soul Godward.” <a id="s70_495"></a>[UB 107:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_6)

12. Adjusters never cease their efforts.
	> “And yet, while the Adjusters utilize the material–gravity circuits, they are not subject thereto as is material creation. The Adjusters are fragments of the ancestor of gravity, not the consequentials of gravity; they have segmentized on a universe level of existence which is hypothetically antecedent to gravity appearance.
	> 
	> “Thought Adjusters have no relaxation from the time of their bestowal until the day of their release to start for Divinington upon the natural death of their mortal subjects. And those whose subjects do not pass through the portals of natural death do not even experience this temporary respite. Thought Adjusters do not require energy intake; they are energy, energy of the highest and most divine order.” <a id="s75_410"></a>[UB 107:6.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_6)

### III. MISSION AND ASSIGNMENT OF ADJUSTERS

1. Adjusters are wisely and efficiently assigned.
	> “When Adjusters are dispatched for mortal service from Divinington, the are identical in the endowment of existential divinity, but they very in experiential qualities proportional to previous contact in and with evolutionary creatures. We cannot explain the basis of Adjuster assignment, but we conjecture that these divine gifts are bestowed in accordance with some wise and efficient policy of eternal fitness of adaptation to the indwelt personality. We do observe that the more experienced Adjuster is often the indweller of the higher type of human mind; human inheritance must therefore be a considerable factor in determining selection and assignment.” <a id="s80_664"></a>[UB 108:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p1_1)
2. Adjusters are believed to be volunteers.
	> “Although we do not definitely know, we firmly believe that all Thought Adjusters are volunteers. But before ever they volunteer, they are in possession of full data respecting the candidate for indwelling. The seraphic drafts of ancestry and projected patterns of life conduct are transmitted via Paradise to the reserve corps of Adjusters on Divinington by the reflectivity technique extending inward from the capitals of the local universes to the headquarters of the superuniverses. This forecast covers not only the hereditary antecedents of the mortal candidate but also the estimate of probable intellectual endowment and spiritual capacity. The Adjusters thus volunteer to indwell minds of whose intimate natures they have been fully apprised.” <a id="s82_756"></a>[UB 108:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p1_2)
3. What the Adjuster wants to know.
	> “The volunteering Adjuster is particularly interested in three qualifications of the human candidate:
	> 
	> “1. _Intellectual capacity_. Is the mind normal? What is the intellectual potential, the intelligence capacity? Can the individual develop into a bona fide will creature? Will wisdom have an opportunity to function?
	> 
	> “2. _Spiritual perception_. The prospects of reverential development, the birth and growth of the religious nature. What is the potential of soul, the probable spiritual capacity of receptivity?
	> 
	> “3. _Combined intellectual and spiritual powers_. The degree to which these two endowments may possibly be associated, combined, so as to produce strength of human character and contribute to the certain evolution of an immortal soul of survival value.” <a id="s90_257"></a>[UB 108:1.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p1_3)
4. Adjuster’s transit speed.
	> “When once the Adjusters are actually dispatched from Divinington, practically no time intervenes between that moment and the hour of their appearance in the minds of their chosen subjects. The average transit time of an Adjuster from Divinington to Urantia is 117 hours, 42 minutes, and 7 seconds. Virtually all of this time is occupied with registration on Uversa.” <a id="s92_371"></a>[UB 108:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p1_9)
5. Adjusters indispensable to Paradise ascension.
	> “The Adjusters accept a difficult assignment when they volunteer to indwell such composite beings as live on Urantia. But they have assumed the task of existing in your minds, there to receive the admonitions of the spiritual intelligences of the realms and then to undertake to redictate or translate these spiritual messages to the material mind; they are indispensable to the Paradise ascension.” <a id="s94_403"></a>[UB 108:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_1)
6. Adjusters never fail in their assignment.
	> “One thing you can depend upon: The Adjusters will never lose anything committed to their care; never have we known these spirit helpers to default. Angels and other high types of spirit beings, not excepting the local universe type of Sons, may occasionally embrace evil, may sometimes depart from the divine way, but Adjusters never falter. They are absolutely dependable, and this is equally true of all seven groups.” <a id="s96_425"></a>[UB 108:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_3)
7. Adjuster arouses a hunger for perfection.
	> “The indwelling Thought Adjuster unfailingly arouses in man’s soul a true and searching hunger for perfection together with a far–reaching curiosity which can be adequately satisfied only by communion with God, the divine source of that Adjuster. The hungry soul of man refuses to be satisfied with anything less than the personal realization of the living God. Whatever more God may be than a high and perfect moral personality, he cannot, in our hungry and finite concept, be anything less.” <a id="s98_497"></a>[UB 102:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p1_6)
8. Adjuster is the cosmic window of the soul.
	> “All of man’s truly religious reactions are sponsored by the early ministry of the adjutant of worship and are censored by the adjutant of wisdom. Man’s first supermind endowment is that of personality encircuitment in the Holy Spirit of the Universe Creative Spirit; and long before either the bestowals of the divine Sons or the universal bestowal of the Adjusters, this influence functions to enlarge man’s viewpoint of ethics, religion, and spirituality. Subsequent to the bestowals of the Paradise Sons the liberated Spirit of Truth makes mighty contributions to the enlargement of the human capacity to perceive religious truths. As evolution advances on an inhabited world, the Thought Adjusters increasingly participate in the development of the higher types of human religious insight. The Thought Adjuster is the cosmic window through which the finite creature may faithglimpse the certainties and divinities of limitless Deity, the Universal Father.” <a id="s100_965"></a>[UB 103:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p0_1)
9. Adjusters overcome our planetary isolation.
	> “The isolation of a planet in no way affects the Adjusters and their ability to communicate with any part of the local universe, superuniverse, or the central universe. And this is the reason why contacts with the supreme and the self–acting Adjusters of the reserve corps of destiny are so frequently made on quarantined worlds. Recourse is had to such a technique as a means of circumventing the handicaps of planetary isolation. In recent years the archangels’ circuit has functioned on Urantia, but that means of communication is largely limited to the transactions of the archangel corps itself.” <a id="s102_605"></a>[UB 108:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_4)
10. Assignment of Personalized Adjusters.
	> “We really know very little about the nonpersonalized Adjusters; we only contact and communicate with the personalized orders. These are christened on Divinington and are always known by name and not by number. The Personalized Adjusters are permanently domiciled on Divinington; that sacred sphere is their home. They go out from that abode only by the will of the Universal Father. Very few are found in the domains of the local universes, but larger numbers are present in the central universe.” <a id="s104_502"></a>[UB 107:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p3_10)

### IV. PREREQUISITES OF ADJUSTER INDWELLING

1. Adjusters arrive on the first moral decision.
	> “Though the Adjusters volunteer for service as soon as the personality forecasts have been relayed to Divinington, they are not actually assigned until the human subjects make their first moral personality decision. The first moral choice of the human child is automatically indicated in the seventh mind–adjutant and registers instantly, by way of the local universe Creative Spirit, over the universal mind–gravity circuit of the Conjoint Actor in the presence of the Master Spirit of superuniverse jurisdiction, who forthwith dispatches this intelligence to Divinington. Adjusters reach their human subjects on Urantia, on the average, just prior to the sixth birthday. In the present generation it is running five years, ten months, and four days; that is, on the 2, 134th day of terrestrial life.” <a id="s109_806"></a>[UB 108:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_1)
2. Mission of adjutant spirits and Spirit of Truth.
	> “The Adjusters cannot invade the mortal mind until it has been duly prepared by the indwelling ministry of the adjutant mind–spirits and encircuited in the Holy Spirit. And it requires the co–ordinate function of all seven adjutants to thus qualify the human mind for the reception of an Adjuster. Creature mind must exhibit the worship outreach and indicate wisdom function by exhibiting the ability to choose between the emerging values of good and evil—moral choice.
	> 
	> “Thus is the stage of the human mind set for the reception of Adjusters, but as a general rule they do not immediately appear to indwell such minds except on those worlds where the Spirit of Truth is functioning as a spiritual co–ordinator of these different spirit ministries. If this spirit of the bestowal Sons is present, the Adjusters unfailingly come the instant the seventh adjutant mind–spirit begins to function and signalizes to the Universe Mother Spirit that it has achieved in potential the co–ordination of the associated six adjutants of prior ministry to such a mortal intellect. Therefore have the divine Adjusters been universally bestowed upon all normal minds of moral status on Urantia ever since the day of Pentecost.” <a id="s113_744"></a>[UB 108:2.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_2)
3. Moral decision is the determining factor.
	> “Even with a Spirit of Truth endowed mind, the Adjusters cannot arbitrarily invade the mortal intellect prior to the appearance of moral decision. But when such a moral decision has been made, this spirit helper assumes jurisdiction direct from Divinington. There are no intermediaries or other intervening authorities or powers functioning between the divine Adjusters and their human subjects; God and man are directly related.” <a id="s115_434"></a>[UB 108:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_4)
4. Determining factors of Adjuster bestowal.
	> “Before the times of the pouring out of the Spirit of Truth upon the inhabitants of an evolutionary world, the Adjusters’ bestowal appears to be determined by many spirit influences and personality attitudes. We do not fully comprehend the laws governing such bestowals; we do not understand just what determines the release of the Adjusters who have volunteered to indwell such evolving minds. But we do observe numerous influences and conditions which appear to be associated with the arrival of the Adjusters in such minds prior to the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, and they are:
	> 
	> “1. The assignment of personal seraphic guardians. If a mortal has not been previously indwelt by an Adjuster, the assignment of a personal guardian brings the Adjuster forthwith. There exists some very definite but unknown relation between the ministry of Adjusters and the ministry of personal seraphic guardians.
	> 
	> “2. The attainment of the third circle of intellectual achievement and spiritual attainment. I have observed Adjusters arrive in mortal minds upon the conquest of the third circle even before such an accomplishment could be signalized to the local universe personalities concerned with such matters.
	> 
	> “3. Upon the making of a supreme decision of unusual spiritual import. Such human behavior in a personal planetary crisis usually is attended by the immediate arrival of the waiting Adjuster.
	> 
	> “4. The spirit of brotherhood. Regardless of the attainment of the psychic circles and the assignment of personal guardians –– in the absence of anything resembling a crisis decision –– when an evolving mortal becomes dominated by the love of his fellows and consecrated to unselfish ministry to his brethren in the flesh, the waiting Adjuster unvaryingly descends to indwell the mind of such a mortal minister.
	> 
	> “5. Declaration of intention to do the will of God. We observe that many mortals on the worlds of space may be apparently in readiness to receive Adjusters, and yet the Monitors do not appear. We go on watching such creatures as they live from day to day, and presently they quietly, almost unconsciously, arrive at the decision to begin the pursuit of the doing of the will of the Father in heaven. And then we observe the immediate dispatch of the Thought Adjusters.
	> 
	> “6. Influence of the Supreme Being. On worlds where the Adjusters do not fuse with the evolving souls of the mortal inhabitants, we observe Adjusters sometimes bestowed in response to influences which are wholly beyond our comprehension. We conjecture that such bestowals are determined by some cosmic reflex action originating in the Supreme Being. As to why these Adjusters can not or do not fuse with these certain types of evolving mortal minds we do not know. Such transactions have never been revealed to us.” <a id="s129_519"></a>[UB 108:2.5-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_5)
5. All created beings would welcome Adjusters.
	> “There are no created beings that would not delight to be hosts to the Mystery Monitors, but no orders of beings are thus indwelt excepting evolutionary will creatures of finaliter destiny.” <a id="s131_194"></a>[UB 107:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_7)

### V. ADJUSTER’S RELATION TO HUMAN MIND

1. Adjusters indwell mortal minds.
	> “Adjusters should not be thought of as living in the material brains of human beings. They are not organic parts of the physical creatures of the realms. The Thought Adjuster may more properly be envisaged as indwelling the mortal mind of man rather than as existing within the confines of a single physical organ. And indirectly and unrecognized the Adjuster is constantly communicating with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of the worshipful contact of mind with spirit in the super–consciousness.” <a id="s136_534"></a>[UB 110:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_1)
2. Adjuster’s manifold work in the mind.
	> “I wish it were possible for me to help evolving mortals to achieve a better understanding and attain a fuller appreciation of the unselfish and superb work of the Adjusters living within them, who are so devoutly faithful to the task of fostering man’s spiritual welfare. These Monitors are efficient ministers to the higher phases of men’s minds; they are wise and experienced manipulators of the spiritual potential of the human intellect. These heavenly helpers are dedicated to the stupendous task of guiding you safely inward and upward to the celestial haven of happiness. These tireless toilers are consecrated to the future personification of the triumph of divine truth in your life everlasting. They are the watchful workers who pilot the God–conscious human mind away from the shoals of evil while expertly guiding the evolving soul of man towards the divine harbors of perfection on far–distant and eternal shores. The Adjusters are loving leaders, your safe and sure guides through the dark and uncertain mazes of your short earthly career; they are the patient teachers who so constantly urge their subjects forward in the paths of progressive perfection. They are the careful custodians of the sublime values of creature character. I wish you could love them more, co–operate with them more fully, and cherish them more affectionately.” <a id="s138_1356"></a>[UB 110:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_2)
3. Adjuster is the mind’s spiritual nucleus.
	> “Mortal man has a spirit nucleus. The mind is a personal–energy system existing around a divine spirit nucleus and functioning in a material environment. Such a living relationship of personal mind and spirit constitutes the universe potential of eternal personality. Real trouble, lasting disappointment, serious defeat, or inescapable death can come only after self–concepts presume fully to displace the governing power of the central spirit nucleus, thereby disrupting the cosmic scheme of personality identity.” <a id="s140_520"></a>[UB 12:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_6)
4. How Thought Adjusters work.
	> “It is exceedingly difficult for the meagerly spiritualized, material mind of mortal man to experience marked consciousness of the spirit activities of such divine entities as the Paradise Adjusters. As the soul of joint mind and Adjuster creation becomes increasingly existent, there also evolves a new phase of soul consciousness which is capable of experiencing the presence, and of recognizing the spirit leadings and other supermaterial activities, of the Mystery Monitors.
	> 
	> “The entire experience of Adjuster communion is one involving “The entire experience of Adjuster communion is one involving moral status, mental motivation, and spiritual experience. The self–realization of such an achievement is mainly, though not exclusively, limited to the realms of soul consciousness, but the proofs are forthcoming and abundant in the manifestation of the fruits of the spirit in the lives of all such innerspirit contactors.” <a id="s144_453"></a>[UB 5:2.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_5)
5. Adjuster’s relation to human emotions.
	> “Your transient and ever-changing emotions of joy and sorrow are in the main purely human and material reactions to your internal psychic climate and to your external material environment. Do not, therefore, look to the Adjuster for selfish consolation and mortal comfort. It is the business of the Adjuster to prepare you for the eternal adventure, to assure your survival. It is not the mission of the Mystery Monitor to smooth your ruffled feelings or to minister to your injured pride; it is the preparation of your soul for the long ascending career that engages the attention and occupies the time of the Adjuster.” <a id="s146_625"></a>[UB 108:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_6)
6. Adjusters would deliver us from fear.
	> “The Thought Adjusters would like to change your feelings of fear to convictions of love and confidence; but they cannot mechanically and arbitrarily do such things; that is your task. In executing those decisions which deliver you from the fetters of fear, you literally supply the psychic fulcrum on which the Adjuster may subsequently apply a spiritual lever of uplifting and advancing illumination.” <a id="s148_407"></a>[UB 108:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_8)
7. Their work is more or less of a mystery.
	> “I doubt that I am able to explain to you just what the Adjusters do in your minds and for your souls. I do not know that I am fully cognizant of what is really going on in the cosmic association of a divine Monitor and a human mind. It is all somewhat of a mystery to us, not as to the plan and purpose but as to the actual mode of accomplishment. And this is just why we are confronted with such difficulty in finding an appropriate name for these supernal gifts to mortal men.” <a id="s150_484"></a>[UB 108:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_7)
8. Complex work of Adjuster in the mind.
	> “Adjusters are able to receive the continuous stream of cosmic intelligence coming in over the master circuits of time and space; they are in full touch with the spirit intelligence and energy of the universes. But these mighty indwellers are unable to transmit very much of this wealth of wisdom and truth to the minds of their mortal subjects because of the lack of commonness of nature and the absence of responsive recognition.
	> 
	> “The Thought Adjuster is engaged in a constant effort so to spiritualize your mind as to evolve your morontia soul; but you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry. You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster.” <a id="s154_337"></a>[UB 110:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_1)

### VI. ADJUSTERS AND PERSONALITY

1. Adjusters are real entities—though not personal.
	> “Thought Adjusters are not personalities, but they are real entities; they are truly and perfectly individualized, although they are never, while indwelling mortals, actually personalized. Thought Adjusters are not true personalities; they are _true realities_, realities of the purest order known in the universe of universes—they are the divine presence. Though not personal, these marvelous fragments of the Father are commonly referred to as beings and sometimes, in view of the spiritual phases of their present ministry to mortals, as spirit entities.” <a id="s159_562"></a>[UB 107:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_1)
2. Adjusters individuation a universe mystery.
	> “If Thought Adjusters are not personalities having prerogatives of will and powers of choice, how then can they select mortal subjects and volunteer to indwell these creatures of the evolutionary worlds? This is a question easy to ask, but probably no being in the universe of universes has ever found the exact answer. Even my order of personality, the Solitary Messengers, does not fully understand the endowment of will, choice, and love in entities that are not personal.” <a id="s161_480"></a>[UB 107:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_2)
3. Adjuster volition must be on prepersonal level.
	> “We have often speculated that Thought Adjusters must have volition on all _prepersonal_ levels of choice. They volunteer to indwell human beings, they lay plans for man’s eternal career, they adapt, modify, and substitute in accordance with, circumstances, and these activities connote genuine volition. They have affection for mortals, they function in universe crises, they are always waiting to act decisively in accordance with human choice, and all these are highly volitional reactions. In all situations not concerned with the domain of the human will, they unquestionably exhibit conduct which betokens the exercise of powers in every sense the equivalent of will, maximated decision.” <a id="s163_698"></a>[UB 107:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_3)
4. Human will dominates Adjuster–human partnership.
	> “Why then, if Thought Adjusters possess volition, are they subservient to the mortal will? We believe it is because Adjuster volition, though absolute in nature, is prepersonal in manifestation. Human will functions on the personality level of universe reality, and throughout the cosmos the impersonal—the nonpersonal, the subpersonal, and the prepersonal—is ever responsive to the will and acts of existent personality.” <a id="s165_426"></a>[UB 107:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p7_4)
5. Adjuster is your real and eternal self.
	> “Even though the spirit of a Son be poured out upon all flesh, even though a Son once dwelt with you in the likeness of mortal flesh, even though the seraphim personally guard and guide you, how can any of these divine beings of the Second and Third Centers ever hope to come as near to you or to understand you as fully as the Father, who has given a part of himself to be in you, to be your real and divine, even your eternal, self?” <a id="s167_439"></a>[UB 12:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p7_14)
6. Recognition of Adjusters.
	> “There is a real proof of spiritual reality in the presence of the Thought Adjuster, but the validity of this presence is not demonstrable to the external world, only to the one who thus experiences the indwelling of God. The consciousness of the Adjuster is based on the intellectual reception of truth, the supermind perception of goodness, and the personality motivation to love.” <a id="s169_387"></a>[UB 103:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_14)

### VII. GOD IN MAN

1. A fragment of the living God lives in man.
	> “If the finite mind of man is unable to comprehend how so great and so majestic a God as the Universal Father can descend from his eternal abode in infinite perfection to fraternize with the individual human creature, then must such a finite intellect rest assurance of divine fellowship upon the truth of the fact that an actual fragment of the living God resides within the intellect of every normal–minded and morally conscious Urantia mortal. The indwelling Thought Adjusters are a part of the eternal Deity of the Paradise Father. Man does not have to go farther than his own inner experience of the soul’s contemplation of this spiritual–reality presence to find God and attempt communion with him.” <a id="s174_709"></a>[UB 5:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p0_1)
2. A part of God dwells within us.
	> “The physical bodies of mortals are ‘the temples of God.’ Notwithstanding that the Sovereign Creator Sons come near the creatures of their inhabited worlds and ‘draw all men to themselves’; though they ‘stand at the door’ of consciousness ‘and knock’ and delight to come in to all who will ‘open the doors of their hearts’; although there does exist this intimate personal communion between the Creator Sons and their mortal creatures, nevertheless, mortal men have something from God himself which actually dwells within them; their bodies are the temples thereof.” <a id="s176_570"></a>[UB 1:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_2)
3. The Creator lives in the creature.
	> “The creature not only exists in God, but God also lives in the creature. ‘We know we dwell in him because he lives in us; he has given us his spirit. This gift from the Paradise Father is man’s inseparable companion.’ ‘He is the ever–present and all–pervading God.’ ‘The spirit of the everlasting Father is concealed in the mind of every mortal child.’ ‘Man goes forth searching for a friend while that very friend lives within his own heart.” ‘The true God is not afar off; he is a part of us; his spirit speaks from within us.’ The Father lives in the child. God is always with us. He is the guiding spirit of eternal destiny.’” <a id="s178_635"></a>[UB 3:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_4)
4. Adjusters share our life experiences.
	> “Truly of the human race has it been said, ‘You are of God’ because ‘he who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.’ Even in wrongdoing you torment, the indwelling gift of God, for the Thought Adjuster must needs go through the consequences of evil thinking with the human mind of its incarceration.” <a id="s180_310"></a>[UB 3:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_5)
5. Adjusters actually indwell animal–origin beings.
	> “It is indeed a marvel of divine condescension for the exalted and perfect Adjusters to offer themselves for actual existence in the minds of material creatures, such as the mortals of Urantia, really to consummate a probationary union with the animal–origin beings of earth.” <a id="s182_280"></a>[UB 108:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_1)
6. Adjusters are God’s contact with man.
	> “In the mortal will creatures the Father is actually present in the indwelling Adjuster, a fragment of his prepersonal spirit; and the Father is also the source of the personality of such a mortal will creature.
	> 
	> “These Thought Adjusters, the bestowals of the Universal Father, are comparatively isolated; they indwell human minds but have no discernible connection with the ethical affairs of a local creation. They are not directly co–ordinated with the seraphic service nor with the administration of systems, constellations, or a local universe, not even with the rule of a Creator Son, whose will is the supreme law of his universe.
	> 
	> “The indwelling Adjusters are one of God’s separate but unified modes of contact with the creatures of his all but infinite creation. Thus does he who is invisible to mortal man manifest his presence, and could he do so, he would show himself to us in still other ways, but such further revelation is not divinely possible.” <a id="s188_328"></a>[UB 32:4.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p4_5)
7. Adjusters are the Father’s love incarnate in man.
	> “Although the Universal Father is personally resident on Paradise, at the very center of the universes, he is also actually present on the worlds of space in the minds of his countless children of time, for he indwells them as the Mystery Monitors. The eternal Father is at one and the same time farthest removed from, and most intimately associated with, his planetary mortal sons.
	> 
	> “The Adjusters are the actuality of the Father’s love incarnate in the souls of men; they are the veritable promise of man’s eternal career imprisoned within the mortal mind; they are the essence of man’s perfected finaliter personality, which he can foretaste in time as he progressively masters the divine technique of achieving the living of the Father’s will, step by step, through the ascension of universe upon universe until he actually attains the divine presence of his Paradise Father.” <a id="s192_500"></a>[UB 107:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_1)

### VIII. THE DIVINE PRESENCE

1. The divine presence abides within us.
	> “The divine presence cannot, however, be discovered anywhere in nature or even in the lives of God–knowing mortals so fully and so certainly as in your attempted communion with the indwelling Mystery Monitor, the Paradise Thought Adjuster. What a mistake to dream of God far off in the skies when the spirit of the Universal Father lives within your own mind!” <a id="s197_364"></a>[UB 5:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_3)
2. Adjuster is a part of infinite Deity.
	> “The great God makes direct contact with mortal man and gives a part of his infinite and eternal and incomprehensible self to live and dwell within him. God has embarked upon the eternal adventure with man. If you yield to the leadings of the spiritual forces in you and around you, you cannot fail to attain the high destiny established by a loving God as the universe goal of his ascendant creatures from the evolutionary worlds of space.” <a id="s199_445"></a>[UB 5:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_12)
3. Adjusters the source of spirit insight.
	> “The divine nature may be perceived only with the eyes of the mind. But the mind that really discerns God, hears the indwelling Adjuster, is the pure mind. ‘Without holiness no man may see the Lord.’ All such inner and spiritual communion is termed spiritual insight. Such religious experiences result from the impress made upon the mind of man by the combined operations of the Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth as they function amid and upon the ideas, ideals, insights, and spirit strivings of the evolving sons of God.” <a id="s201_526"></a>[UB 101:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_3)
4. Adjusters and God–consciousness.
	> “The realization of the recognition of spiritual values is an experience which is superideational. There is no word in any human language which can be employed to designate this ‘sense,’ ‘feeling,’ ‘intuition,’ or ‘experience’ which we have elected to call God–consciousness. The spirit of God that dwells in man is not personal—the Adjuster is prepersonal—but this Monitor presents a value, exudes a flavor of divinity, which is personal in the highest and infinite sense. If God were not at least personal, he could not be conscious, and if not conscious, then would he be infrahuman.” <a id="s203_591"></a>[UB 103:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_6)
5. Adjuster is source of idealism of altruism.
	> “The early evolutionary mind gives origin to a feeling of social duty and moral obligation derived chiefly from emotional fear. The more positive urge of social service and the idealism of altruism are derived from the direct impulse of the divine spirit indwelling the human mind.” <a id="s205_286"></a>[UB 103:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_1)
6. Spirit origin of man’s spiritual impulses.
	> “It is fatal to man’s idealism when he is taught that all of his altruistic impulses are merely the development of his natural herd instincts. But he is ennobled and mightily energized when he learns that these higher urges of his soul emanate from the spiritual forces that indwell his mortal mind.
	> “It lifts man out of himself and beyond himself when he once fully realizes that there lives and strives within him something which is eternal and divine. and so it is that a living faith in the superhuman origin of our ideals validates our belief that we are the sons of God and makes real our altruistic convictions, the feelings of the brotherhood of man.” <a id="s208_363"></a>[UB 103:5.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_8)
7. Adjuster attunement measure of spirituality.
	> “Actual spiritual status is the measure of Deity attainment. Adjuster attunement. The achievement of finality of spirituality is equivalent to the attainment of the maximum of reality, the maximum of Godlikeness. Eternal life is the endless quest for infinite values.” <a id="s210_272"></a>[UB 100:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_5)
8. Mystery Monitors are patient indwellers.
	> “In this universal bestowal of himself we have abundant proof of both the magnitude and the magnanimity of the Father’s divine nature. If God has withheld aught of himself from the universal creation, then of that residue he is in lavish generosity bestowing the Thought Adjusters upon the mortals of the realms, the Mystery Monitors of time, who so patiently indwell the mortal candidates for life everlasting.” <a id="s212_416"></a>[UB 32:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p4_11)

### IX. WHAT ADJUSTERS DO FOR US

1. The three phases of Adjuster ministry.
	> “On the evolutionary worlds, will creatures traverse three general developmental stages of being; From the arrival of the Adjuster to comparative full growth, about twenty years of age on Urantia, the Monitors are sometimes designated Thought Changers. From this time to the attainment of the age of discretion, about forty years, the Mystery Monitors are called Thought Adjusters. From the attainment of discretion to deliverance from the flesh, they are often referred to as Thought Controllers. These three phases of mortal life have no connection with the three stages of Adjuster progress in mind duplication and soul evolution.” <a id="s217_638"></a>[UB 107:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_7) 
2. Adjusters impel belief in God.
	> “Thus it may be seen that religious longings and spiritual urges are not of such a nature as would merely lead men to _want_ to believe in God, but rather are they of such nature and power that men are profoundly impressed with the conviction that they _ought_ to believe in God. The sense of evolutionary duty and the obligations consequent upon the illumination of revelation make such a profound impression upon man's moral nature that he finally reaches that position of mind and that attitude of soul where he concludes that he _has no right not to believe in God._ The higher and superphilosophic wisdom of such enlightened and disciplined individuals ultimately instructs them that to doubt God or distrust his goodness would be to prove untrue to the _realest_ and _deepest_ thing within the human mind and soul––the divine Adjuster.” <a id="s219_846"></a>[UB 101:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_7)
3. Adjusters the source of altruism.
	> “The impulse of the spirit Monitor is realized in human consciousness as the urge to be altruistic, fellow–creature minded. At least this is the early and fundamental experience of the child mind. When the growing child fails of personality unification, the altruistic drive may become so overdeveloped as to work serious injury to the welfare of the self. A misguided conscience can become responsible for much conflict, worry, sorrow, and no end of human unhappiness.” <a id="s221_474"></a>[UB 103:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_10)
4. Adjuster makes real our cosmic insight.
	> “The pursuit of knowledge constitutes science; the search for wisdom is philosophy; the love for God is religion; the hunger for truth _is_ a revelation. But it is the indwelling Thought Adjuster that attaches the feeling of reality to man’s spiritual insight into the cosmos.” <a id="s223_281"></a>[UB 102:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_12)
5. Adjusters are concerned with mortal survival.
	> “Adjusters are interested in, and concerned with, your daily doings and the manifold details of your life just to the extent that these are influential in the determination of your significant temporal choices and vital spiritual decisions and, hence, are factors in the solution of your problem of soul survival and eternal progress. The Adjuster, while passive regarding purely temporal welfare, is divinely active concerning all the affairs of your eternal future.” <a id="s225_472"></a>[UB 110:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_4)
6. Interested in both temporal and eternal welfare.
	> “Although the divine indwellers are chiefly concerned with your spiritual preparation for the next stage of the never–ending existence, they are also deeply interested in your temporal welfare and in your real achievements on earth. They are delighted to contribute to your health, happiness, and true prosperity. They are not indifferent to your success in all matters of planetary advancement which are not inimical to your future life of eternal progress.” <a id="s227_463"></a>[UB 110:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_3)
7. They do not make life easy for us.
	> “The Mystery Monitors are not thought helpers; they are thought adjusters. They labor with the material mind for the purpose of constructing, by adjustment and spiritualization, a new mind for the new worlds and the new name of your future career. Their mission chiefly concerns the future life, not this life. They are called heavenly helpers, not earthly helpers. They are not interested in making the mortal career easy; rather are they concerned in making your life reasonably difficult and rugged, so that decisions will be stimulated and multiplied. The presence of a great Thought Adjuster does not bestow ease of living and freedom from strenuous thinking, but such a divine gift should confer a sublime peace of mind and a superb tranquility of spirit.” <a id="s229_766"></a>[UB 108:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_5)
8. Adjusters truly and divinely love us.
	> “The Adjuster is man’s eternity possibility; man is the Adjuster’s personality possibility. Your individual Adjusters work to spiritize you in the hope of eternalizing your temporal identity. The Adjusters are saturated with the beautiful and self–bestowing love of the Father of spirits. They truly and divinely love you; they are the prisoners of spirit hope confined within the minds of men. They long for the divinity attainment of your mortal minds that their loneliness may end, that they may be delivered with you from the limitations of material investiture and the habiliments of time.” <a id="s231_599"></a>[UB 107:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_2)
9. Eternal partnership of Adjuster association.
	> “Your path to Paradise is the path of spirit attainment, and the Adjuster nature will faithfully unfold the revelation of the spiritual nature of the Universal Father. Beyond the Paradise ascent and in the postfinaliter stages of the eternal career, the Adjuster may possibly contact with the onetime human partner in other than spirit ministry; but the Paradise ascent and the finaliter career are the partnership between the God–knowing spiritualizing mortal and the spiritual ministry of the God–revealing Adjuster.” <a id="s233_523"></a>[UB 107:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_3)

10. They create our longing to be Godlike.
	> “It is the Adjuster who creates within man that unquenchable yearning and incessant longing to be like God, to attain Paradise, and there before the actual person of Deity to worship the infinite source of the divine gift. The Adjuster is the living presence which actually links the mortal son with his Paradise Father and draws him nearer and nearer to the Father. The Adjuster is our compensatory equalization of the enormous universe tension which is created by the distance of man's removal from God and by the degree of his partiality in contrast with the universality of the eternal Father.” <a id="s236_602"></a>[UB 107:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_5)

11. Adjusters guide us to God.
	> “After all, the greatest evidence of the goodness of God and the supreme reason for loving him is the indwelling gift of the Father—the Adjuster who so patiently awaits the hour when you both shall be eternally made one. Though you cannot find God by searching, if you will submit to the leading of the indwelling spirit, you will be unerringly guided, step by step, life by life, through universe upon universe, and age by age, until you finally stand in the presence of the Paradise personality of the Universal Father.” <a id="s239_526"></a>[UB 2:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_5)

12. They help to make us perfect.
	> “God, having commanded man to be perfect, even as he is perfect, has descended as the Adjuster to become man’s experiential partner in the achievement of the supernal destiny which has been thus ordained. The fragment of God which indwells the mind of man is the absolute and unqualified assurance that man can find the Universal Father in association with this divine Adjuster, which came forth from God to find man and sonship him even in the days of the flesh.” <a id="s242_468"></a>[UB 107:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_3)

13. And they do enjoy communicating with us.
	> “The Adjusters are the eternal ancestors, the divine originals, of your evolving immortal souls; they are the unceasing urge that leads man to attempt the mastery of the material and present existence in the light of the spiritual and future career. The Monitors are the prisoners of undying hope, the founts of everlasting progression. And how they do enjoy communicating with their subjects in more or less direct channels! How they rejoice when they can dispense with symbols and other methods of indirection and flash their messages straight to the intellects of their human partners! I” <a id="s245_595"></a>[UB 108:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_7)

### X. THE OVER–ALL WORK OF ADJUSTERS

1. Adjusters have to do with the “image of God.”
	> “The Mystery Monitors are undoubtedly the bestowal of the Universal Father, the reflection of the image of God abroad in the universe. A great teacher once admonished men that they should be renewed in the spirit of their minds; that they become new men who, like God, are created in righteousness and in the completion of truth. The Adjuster is the mark of divinity, the presence of God. The ‘image of God’ does not refer to physical likeness nor to the circumscribed limitations of material creature endowment but rather to the gift of the spirit presence of the Universal Father in the supernal bestowal of the Thought Adjusters upon the humble creatures of the universes,” <a id="s250_680"></a>[UB 108:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_3)
2. Adjusters distinguish man from animals.
	> “The Adjuster is the wellspring of spiritual attainment and the hope of divine character within you. He is the power, privilege, and the possibility of survival, which so fully and forever distinguishes you from mere animal creatures. He is the higher and truly internal spiritual stimulus of thought in contrast with the external and physical stimulus, which reaches the mind over the nerve–energy mechanism of the material body.” <a id="s252_435"></a>[UB 108:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_4)
3. Adjusters are creating survival values.
	> “These faithful custodians of the future career unfailingly duplicate every mental creation with a spiritual counterpart; they are thus slowly and surely re–creating you as you really are (only spiritually) for resurrection on the survival worlds. And all of these exquisite spirit recreations are being preserved in the emerging reality of your evolving and immortal soul, your morontia self. These realities are actually there, notwithstanding that the Adjuster is seldom able to exalt these duplicate creations sufficiently to exhibit them to the light of consciousness.” <a id="s254_578"></a>[UB 108:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_5)
4. Adjuster the divine parent of the real you.
	> “And as you are the human parent, so is the Adjuster the divine parent of the real you, your higher and advancing self, your better morontial and future spiritual self. And it is this evolving morontial soul that the judges and censors discern when they decree your survival and pass you upward to new worlds and never–ending existence in eternal liaison with your faithful partner—God, the Adjuster.” <a id="s256_405"></a>[UB 108:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_6)
5. Adjusters insured the survival of religion.
	> “Man evolved through the superstitions of mana, magic, nature worship, spirit fear, and animal worship to the various ceremonials whereby the religious attitude of the individual became the group reactions of the clan. And then these ceremonies became focalized and crystallized into tribal beliefs, and eventually these fears and faiths became personalized into gods. But in all of this religious evolution the moral element was never wholly absent. The impulse of the God within man was always potent. And these powerful influences—one human and the other divine—insured the survival of religion throughout the vicissitudes of the ages and that notwithstanding it was so often threatened with extinction by a thousand subversive tendencies and hostile antagonisms.” <a id="s258_771"></a>[UB 103:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p3_5)
6. Adjuster relation to other spirits.
	> “Thought Adjusters appear to come and go quite independent of any and all other spiritual presences; they seem to function in accordance with universe laws quite apart from those which govern and control the performances of all other spirit influences. But regardless of such apparent independence, long–range observation unquestionably discloses that they function in the human mind in perfect synchrony and co–ordination with all other spirit ministries, including adjutant mind–spirits, Holy Spirit, Spirit of Truth, and other influences.” <a id="s260_546"></a>[UB 108:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_3)
7. Adjusters act in a crisis.
	> “When it comes to the sharp and well–defined conflicts between the higher and lower tendencies of the races, between what _really is_ right or wrong (not merely what you may call right and wrong), you can depend upon it that the Adjuster will always participate in some definite and active manner in such experiences. The fact that such Adjuster activity may be unconscious to the human partner does not in the least detract from its value and reality.” <a id="s262_457"></a>[UB 108:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_9)
8. Adjusters account for spiritual unity.
	> “The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique –– no two mortals being alike –– it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth–century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.” <a id="s264_1092"></a>[UB 103:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_1)
9. When Adjusters forsake human beings.
	> “The Adjuster remains with you in all disaster and through every sickness which does not wholly destroy the mentality. But how unkind knowingly to defile or otherwise deliberately to pollute the physical body, which must serve as the earthly tabernacle of this marvelous gift from God. All physical poisons greatly retard the efforts of the Adjuster to exalt the material mind, while the mental poisons of fear, anger, envy, jealousy, suspicion, and intolerance likewise tremendously interfere with the spiritual progress of the evolving soul.” <a id="s266_548"></a>[UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5)
10. Tremendous significance of the Adjuster.
	> “Can you really realize the true significance of the Adjuster’s indwelling? Do you really fathom what it means to have an absolute fragment of the absolute and infinite Deity, the Universal Rather, indwelling and fusing with your finite mortal natures? When mortal man fuses with an actual fragment of the existential Cause of the total cosmos, no limit can ever be placed upon the destiny of such an unprecedented and unimaginable partnership. In eternity, man will be discovering not only the infinity of the objective Deity but also the unending potentiality of the subjective fragment of this same God. Always will the Adjuster be revealing to the mortal personality the wonder of God, and never can this supernal revelation come to an end, for the Adjuster is of God and as God to mortal man.” <a id="s268_802"></a>[UB 107:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_7)

### XI. ADJUSTERS AS RELATED TO HUMAN WILL

1. In everything we must be willing partners.
	> “They are persistent, ingenious, and perfect in their methods of work, but they never do violence to the volitional selfhood of their hosts. No human being will ever be spiritualized by a divine Monitor against his will; survival is a gift of the Gods which must be desired by the creatures of time. In the final analysis, whatever the Adjuster has succeeded in doing for you, the records will show that the transformation has been accomplished with your co–operative consent; you will have been a willing partner with the Adjuster in the attainment of every step of the tremendous transformation of the ascension career.” <a id="s273_626"></a>[UB 110:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_2)
2. Adjuster always subservient to human will.
	> “When Thought Adjusters indwell human minds, they bring with them the model careers, the ideal lives, as determined and foreordained by themselves and the Personalized Adjusters of Divinington, which have been certified by the Personalized Adjuster of Urantia. Thus they begin work with a definite and predetermined plan for the intellectual and spiritual development of their human subjects, but it is not incumbent upon any human being to accept this plan. You are all subjects of predestination, but it is not foreordained that you must accept this divine predestination; you are at full liberty to reject any part or all of the Thought Adjusters’ program. It is their mission to effect such mind changes and to make such spiritual adjustments as you may willingly and intelligently authorize, to the end that they may gain more influence over the personality directionization; but under no circumstances do these divine Monitors ever take advantage of you or in any way arbitrarily influence you in your choices and decisions. The Adjusters respect your sovereignty of personality; _they are always subservient to your will_.” <a id="s275_1134"></a>[UB 110:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_1)
3. Adjuster is dependent on mind.
	> “The Thought Adjuster has no special mechanism through which to gain self–expression; there is no mystic religious faculty for the reception or expression of religious emotions. These experiences are made available through the naturally ordained mechanism of mortal mind. And therein lies one explanation of the Adjuster’s difficulty in engaging in direct communication with the material mind of its constant indwelling.” <a id="s277_425"></a>[UB 101:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_2)
4. Only conscious resistance hinders Adjusters.
	> “Confusion, being puzzled, even sometimes discouraged and distracted, does not necessarily signify resistance to the leadings of the indwelling Adjuster. Such attitudes may sometimes connote lack of active co–operation with the divine Monitor and may, therefore, somewhat delay spiritual progress, but such intellectual emotional difficulties do not in the least interfere with the certain survival of the God–knowing soul. Ignorance alone can never prevent survival; neither can confusional doubts nor fearful uncertainty. Only conscious resistance to the Adjuster's leading can prevent the survival of the evolving immortal soul.” <a id="s279_636"></a>[UB 110:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_5)
5. How will can co–operate with the Adjuster.
	> “You must not regard co–operation with your Adjuster as a particularly conscious process, for it is not; but your motives and your decisions, your faithful determinations and your supreme desires, do constitute real and effective co–operation. You can consciously augment Adjuster harmony by:
	> 
	> “1. Choosing to respond to divine leading; sincerely basing the human life on the highest consciousness of truth, beauty, and goodness, and then co–ordinating these qualities of divinity through wisdom, worship, faith, and love.
	> 
	> “2. Loving God and desiring to be like him—genuine recognition of the divine fatherhood and loving worship of the heavenly Parent.
	> 
	> “3. Loving man and sincerely desiring to serve him—wholehearted recognition of the brotherhood of man coupled with an intelligent and wise affection for each of your fellow mortals.
	> 
	> “4. Joyful acceptance of cosmic citizenship—honest recognition of your progressive obligations to the Supreme Being, awareness of the interdependence of evolutionary man and evolving Deity. This is the birth of cosmic morality and the dawning realization of universal duty.” <a id="s289_278"></a>[UB 110:3.6-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_6)
6. Adjusters and the superconscious mind.
	> “If one is disposed to recognize a theoretical subconscious mind as a practical working hypothesis in the otherwise unified intellectual life, then, to be consistent, one should postulate a similar and corresponding realm of ascending intellectual activity as the superconscious level, the zone of immediate contact with the indwelling spirit entity, the Thought Adjuster. The great danger in all these psychic speculations is that visions and other so–called mystic experiences, along with extraordinary dreams, may be regarded as divine communications to the human mind. In times past, divine beings have revealed themselves to certain God–knowing persons, not because of their mystic trances or morbid visions, but in spite of all these phenomena." <a id="s291_755"></a>[UB 100:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_6)
7. Worship best method of contacting the Adjuster.
	> “In contrast with conversion–seeking, the better approach to the morontia zones of possible contact with the Thought Adjuster would be through living faith and sincere worship, wholehearted and unselfish prayer. Altogether too much of the uprush of the memories of the unconscious levels of the human mind has been mistaken for divine revelations and spirit leadings.” <a id="s293_372"></a>[UB 100:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_7)
8. The great challenge.
	> “The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. Man’s greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well–balanced and sane effort to advance the borders of self–consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul–consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spirit–consciousness—contact with the divine presence. Such an experience constitutes God–consciousness, an experience mightily confirmative of the pre–existent truth of the religious experience of knowing God. Such spirit–consciousness is the equivalent of the knowledge of the actuality of sonship with God. Otherwise, the assurance of sonship is the experience of faith.” <a id="s295_747"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34)

### XII. DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF ADJUSTERS

1. The pilot light—the light of life.
	> “There is a characteristic light, a spirit luminosity, which accompanies this divine presence, and which has become generally associated with thought Adjusters. In the universe of Nebadon this Paradise luminosity is widespreadly known as the ‘pilot light’; on Uversa it is called the ‘light of life.’ On Urantia this phenomenon has sometimes been referred to as that ‘true light which lights every man who comes into the world.’” <a id="s300_433"></a>[UB 107:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_5)
2. When Personalized Adjusters are visible.
	> “To all beings who have attained the Universal Father, the Personalized Thought Adjusters are visible. Adjusters of all stages, together with all other beings, entities, spirits, personalities, and spirit manifestations, are always discernible by those Supreme Creator Personalities who originate in the Paradise Deities, and who preside over the major governments of the grand universe.” <a id="s302_392"></a>[UB 107:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_6)
3. Indicators of Adjuster presence.
	> “The actuality of the existence of God is demonstrated in human experience by the indwelling of the divine presence, the spirit Monitor sent from Paradise to live in the mortal mind of man and there to assist in evolving the immortal soul of eternal survival. The presence of this divine Adjuster in the human mind is disclosed by three experiential phenomena:
	> 
	> “1. The intellectual capacity for knowing God—God–consciousness.
	> 
	> “2. The spiritual urge to find God—God–seeking.
	> 
	> “3. The personality craving to be like God—the wholehearted desire to do the Father’s will.” <a id="s310_96"></a>[UB 1:2.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_3)
4. Adjusters detected by Solitary Messengers.
	> “I may relate a further interesting fact: When a Solitary Messenger is on a planet whose inhabitants are indwelt by Thought Adjusters, as on Urantia, he is aware of a qualitative excitation in his detection–sensitivity to spirit presence. In such instances there is no quantitative excitation, only a qualitative agitation. When on a planet to which Adjusters do not come, contact with the natives does not produce any such reaction. This suggests that Thought Adjusters are in some manner related to, or are connected with, the Inspired Spirits of the Paradise Trinity. In some way they may possibly be associated in certain phases of their work; but we do not really know. They both originate near the center and source of all things, but they are not the same order of being. Thought Adjusters spring from the Father alone; Inspired Spirits are the offspring of the Paradise Trinity.” <a id="s312_891"></a>[UB 19:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p5_6)

### XIII. THE PSYCHIC CIRCLES

1. The seven psychic circles.
	> “The sum total of personality realization on a material world is contained within the successive conquest of the seven psychic circles of mortal potentiality. Entrance upon the seventh circle marks the beginning of true human personality function. Completion of the first circle denotes the relative maturity of the mortal being. Though the traversal of the seven circles of cosmic growth does not equal fusion with the Adjuster, the mastery of these circles marks the attainment of those steps which are preliminary to Adjuster fusion.
	> 
	> “The Adjuster is your equal partner in the attainment of the seven circles –– the achievement of comparative mortal maturity. The Adjuster ascends the circles with you from the seventh to the first but progresses to the status of supremacy and self–activity quite independent of the active co–operation of the mortal mind.
	> 
	> “The psychic circles are not exclusively intellectual, neither are they wholly morontial; they have to do with personality status, mind attainment, soul growth, and Adjuster attunement. The successful traversal of these levels demands the harmonious functioning of the _entire personality_, not merely of some one phase thereof. The growth of the parts does not equal the true maturation of the whole; the parts really grow in proportion to the expansion of the entire self—the whole self—material, intellectual, and spiritual.
	> 
	> “When the development of the intellectual nature proceeds faster than that of the spiritual, such a situation renders communication with the Thought Adjuster both difficult and dangerous. Likewise, overspiritual development tends to produce a fanatical and perverted interpretation of the spirit leadings of the divine indweller. Lack of spiritual capacity makes it very difficult to transmit to such a material intellect the spiritual truths resident in the higher superconsciousness. It is to the mind of perfect pose, housed in a body of clean habits, stabilized neural energies, and balanced chemical function—when the physical, mental, and spiritual powers are in triune harmony of development—that a maximum of light and truth can be imparted with a minimum of temporal danger or risk to the real welfare of such a being. By such a balanced growth does man ascend the circles of planetary progression one by one, from the seventh to the first.” <a id="s323_954"></a>[UB 110:6.1-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_1)
2. Decisions advance both Adjuster and the self.
	> “Every decision you make either impedes or facilitates the function of the Adjuster; likewise do these very decisions determine your advancement in the circles of human achievement. It is true that the supremacy of a decision, its crisis relationship, has a great deal to do with its circlemaking influence; nevertheless, numbers of decisions, frequent repetitions, persistent repetitions, are also essential to the habit–forming certainty of such reactions.” <a id="s325_463"></a>[UB 110:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_6)
3. Adjusters work in higher mind levels.
	> “Adjusters work in the spheres of the higher levels of the human mind, unceasingly seeking to produce morontia duplicates of every concept of the mortal intellect. There are, therefore, two realities which impinge upon, and are centered in, the human mind circuits: one, a mortal self evolved from the original plans of the Life Carriers, the other, an immortal entity from the high spheres of Divinington, an indwelling gift from God. But the mortal self is also a personal self; it has personality. ” <a id="s327_506"></a>[UB 110:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_4)
4. In relation to the problems and joys of living.
	> “I cannot but observe that so many of you spend so much time and thought on mere trifles of living, while you almost wholly overlook the more essential realities of everlasting import, those very accomplishments which are concerned with the development of a more harmonious working agreement between you and your Adjusters. The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and understanding consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind. But a devoted and determined effort to realize eternal destiny is wholly compatible with a light–hearted and joyous life and with a successful and honorable career on earth. Co–operation with the Thought Adjuster does not entail self–torture, mock piety, or hypocritical and ostentatious self–abasement; the ideal life is one of loving service rather than an existence of fearful apprehension.” <a id="s329_988"></a>[UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4)

### XIV. SELF–ACTING ADJUSTERS

1. The scope of self–acting Adjusters.
	> “You have been informed of the classification of Adjusters in relation to experience—virgin, advanced, and supreme. You should also recognize a certain functional classification—the self–acting Adjusters. A self–acting Adjuster is one who:
	> “1. Has had certain requisite experience in the evolving life of a will creature, either as a temporary indweller on a type of world where Adjusters are only loaned to mortal subjects or on an actual fusion planet where the human failed of survival. Such a Monitor is either an advanced or a supreme Adjuster.
	> 
	> “2. Has acquired the balance of spiritual power in a human who has made the third psychic circle and has had assigned to him a personal seraphic guardian.
	> 
	> “3. Has a subject who has made the supreme decision, has entered into a solemn and sincere betrothal with the Adjuster. The Adjuster looks beforehand to the time of actual fusion and reckons the union as an event of fact.
	> 
	> “4. Has a subject who has been mustered into one of the reserve corps of destiny on an evolutionary world of mortal ascension.
	> 
	> “5. At some time, during human sleep, has been temporarily detached from the mind of mortal incarceration to perform some exploit of liaison, contact, reregistration, or other extrahuman service associated with the spiritual administration of the world of assignment.
	> 
	> “6. Has served in a time of crisis in the experience of some human being who was the material complement of a spirit personality intrusted with the enactment of some cosmic achievement essential to the spiritual economy of the planet.” <a id="s345_239"></a>[UB 109:2.1-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_1)
2. The manifold doings of self–actors.
	> “Self–acting Adjusters seem to possess a marked degree of will in all matters not involving the human personalities of their immediate indwelling, as is indicated by their numerous exploits both within and without the mortal subjects of attachment. Such Adjusters participate in numerous activities of the realm, but more frequently they function as undetected indwellers of the earthly tabernacles of their own choosing.” <a id="s347_426"></a>[UB 109:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_8)
3. Intercommunication of self–actors.
	> “Undoubtedly these higher and more experienced types of Adjusters can communicate with those in other realms. But while self–acting Adjusters do thus intercommunicate, they do so only on the levels of their mutual work and for the purpose of preserving custodial data essential to the Adjuster ministry of the realms of their sojourn, though on occasions they have been known to function in interplanetary matters during times of crisis.” <a id="s349_442"></a>[UB 109:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_9)
4. Function of supreme and self–acting Adjusters.
	> “Supreme and self–acting Adjusters can leave the human body at will. The indwellers are not an organic or biologic part of mortal life; they are divine superimpositions thereon. In the original life plans they were provided for, but they are not indispensable to material existence. Nevertheless it should be recorded that they very rarely, even temporarily, leave their mortal tabernacles after they once take up their indwelling.
	> “The superacting Adjusters are those who have achieved the conquest of their intrusted tasks and only await the dissolution of the material–life vehicle or the translation of the immortal soul.” <a id="s352_198"></a>[UB 109:2.10-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_10)
5. Function of experienced Adjusters.
	> “The type of Adjuster has much to do with the potential for expression of the human personality. On down through the ages, many of the great intellectual and spiritual leaders of Urantia have exerted their influence chiefly because of the superiority and previous experience of their indwelling Adjusters.” <a id="s354_310"></a>[UB 109:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p4_3)
6. Triumphs of self–acting Adjusters.
	> “Supreme and self–acting Adjusters are often able to contribute factors of spiritual import to the human mind when it flows freely in the liberated but controlled channels of creative imagination. At such times, and sometimes during sleep, the Adjuster is able to arrest the mental currents, to stay the flow, and then to divert the idea procession; and all this is done in order to effect deep spiritual transformations in the higher recesses of the superconsciousness. Thus are the forces and energies of mind more fully adjusted to the key of the contactual tones of the spiritual level of the present and the future.
	> 
	> “It is sometimes possible to have the mind illuminated, to hear the divine voice that continually speaks within you, so that you may become partially conscious of the wisdom, truth, goodness, and beauty of the potential personality constantly indwelling you.” <a id="s358_263"></a>[UB 109:5.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_1)

### XV. HOW ADJUSTERS GAIN EXPERIENCE

1. Adjusters in the child mind.
	> “The psychology of a child is naturally positive, not negative. So many mortals are negative because they were so trained. When it is said that the child is positive, reference is made to his moral impulses, those powers of mind whose emergence signals the arrival of the Thought Adjuster.
	> 
	> “In the absence of wrong teaching, the mind of the normal child moves positively, in the emergence of religious consciousness, toward moral righteousness and social ministry, rather than negatively, away from sin and guilt. There may or may not be conflict in the development of religious experience, but there are always present the inevitable decisions, effort, and function of the human will.
	> 
	> “Moral choosing is usually accompanied by more or less moral conflict. And this very first conflict in the child mind is between the urges of egoism and the impulses of altruism. The Thought Adjuster does not disregard the personality values of the egoistic motive but does operate to place a slight preference upon the altruistic impulse as leading to the goal of human happiness and to the joys of the kingdom of heaven.” <a id="s367_427"></a>[UB 103:2.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_5)
2. Great days of the Adjuster.
	> “The great days in the individual careers of Adjusters are: first, when the human subject breaks through into the third psychic circle, thus insuring the Monitor’s self–activity and increased range of function (provided the indweller was not already self–acting); then, when the human partner attains the first psychic circle, and they are thereby enabled to intercommunicate, at least to some degree; and last, when they are finally and eternally fused.” <a id="s369_459"></a>[UB 110:6.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_22)
3. The evolution of Adjusters.
	> “The first stage of Adjuster evolution is attained in fusion with the surviving soul of a mortal being. Thus, while you are in nature evolving inward and upward from man to God, the Adjusters are in nature evolving outward and downward from God to man; and so will the final product of this union of divinity and humanity eternally be the son of man and the son of God.” <a id="s371_374"></a>[UB 109:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_5)
4. Adjuster experience in nonsurvivors.
	> “But with those beings who are virtually disqualified for survival by disinheritance through the agency of unfit and inferior ancestors, many a virgin Adjuster has served a valuable preliminary experience in contacting evolutionary mind and thus has become better qualified for a subsequent assignment to a higher type of mind on some other world.” <a id="s373_352"></a>[UB 109:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_8)
5. Persistence of all true values.
	> “Adjusters never fail; nothing worth surviving is ever lost; every meaningful value in every will creature is certain of survival, irrespective of the survival or nonsurvival of the meaning–discovering or evaluating personality. And so it is, a mortal creature may reject survival; still the life experience is not wasted; the eternal Adjuster carries the worthwhile features of such an apparent life of failure over into some other world and there bestows these surviving meanings and values upon some higher type of mortal mind, one of survival capacity. No worth–while experience ever happens in vain; no true meaning or real value ever perishes.” <a id="s375_654"></a>[UB 109:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_1)
6. Adjuster salvages values of nonsurvivors.
	> “And God–consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the self with the universe, and on its highest levels of spiritual reality. Only the spirit content of any value is imperishable. Even that which is true, beautiful, and good may not perish in human experience. If man does not choose to survive, then does the surviving Adjuster conserve those realities born of love and nurtured in service. And all these things are a part of the Universal Father. The Father is living love, and this life of the Father is in his Sons. And the spirit of the Father is in his Son’s sons—mortal men. When all is said and done, the Father idea is still the highest human concept of God.” <a id="s377_681"></a>[UB 196:3.35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_35)
7. Adjuster preserves values for next stage of existence.
	> “What the Thought Adjuster cannot utilize in your present life, those truths which he cannot successfully transmit to the man of his betrothal, he will faithfully preserve for use in the next stage of existence, just as he now carries over from circle to circle those items which he fails to register in the experience of the human subject, owing to the creature’s inability, or failure, to give a sufficient degree of co–operation.” <a id="s379_437"></a>[UB 108:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_2)
8. Absolutely nothing takes the place of experience.
	> “Actual living experience has no cosmic substitute. The perfection of the divinity of a newly formed Thought Adjuster does not in any manner endow this Mystery Monitor with experienced ministrative ability. Experience is inseparable from a living existence; it is the one thing which no amount of divine endowment can absolve you from the necessity of securing by _actual living_. Therefore, in common with all beings living and functioning within the present sphere of the Supreme, Thought Adjusters must acquire experience; they must evolve from the lower, inexperienced, to the higher, more experienced, groups.” <a id="s381_619"></a>[UB 109:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_3)

### XVI. POTENTIALS OF ADJUSTER INDWELLING

1. The potentials of Adjuster bestowal.
	> “The fact that he sends forth spirit messengers from himself to indwell the men and women of your world and other worlds in no wise lessens his ability to function as a divine and all–powerful spirit personality; and there is absolutely no limit to the extent or number of such spirit Monitors which he can and may send out. This giving of himself to his creatures creates a boundless, almost inconceivable future possibility of progressive and successive existences for these divinely endowed mortals. And this prodigal distribution of himself as these ministering spirit entities in no manner diminishes the wisdom and perfection of truth and knowledge which repose in the person of the all–wise, all–knowing, and all–powerful Father.” <a id="s386_741"></a>[UB 3:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p4_4)
2. Vast potentials of Adjuster endowment.
	> “The Adjusters of prepersonal status indwell numerous types of mortal creatures, thus insuring that these same beings may survive mortal death to personalize as morontia creatures with the potential of ultimate spirit attainment. For, when such a creature mind of personality endowment is indwelt by a fragment of the spirit of the eternal God, the prepersonal bestowal of the personal Father, then does this finite personality possess the potential of the divine and the eternal and aspire to a destiny akin to the Ultimate, even reaching out for a realization of the Absolute.” <a id="s388_583"></a>[UB 5:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_5)
3. Adjusters crave divine perfection for you.
	> “Your deepest nature—the divine Adjuster—creates within you a hunger and thirst for righteousness, a certain craving for divine perfection. Religion is the faith act of the recognition of this inner urge to divine attainment; and thus is brought about that soul trust and assurance of which you become conscious as the way of salvation, the technique of the survival of personality and all those values which you have come to look upon as being true and good.” <a id="s390_464"></a>[UB 101:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_14)
4. The potentials of Adjuster fusion.
	> “With man, the eventual fusion and resultant oneness with the indwelling Adjuster—the personality synthesis of man and the essence of God—constitute him, in potential, a living part of the Supreme and insure for such a onetime mortal being the eternal birthright of the endless pursuit of finality of universe service for and with the Supreme.” <a id="s392_348"></a>[UB 101:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_6)
5. Adjusters the potential of eternal existence.
	> “Your Adjuster is the potential of your new and next order of existence, the advance bestowal of your eternal sonship with God. By and with the consent of your will, the Adjuster has the power to subject the creature trends of the material mind to the transforming actions of the motivations and purposes of the emerging morontial soul.” <a id="s394_341"></a>[UB 108:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_4)

### XVII. ADJUSTER PROBLEMS AND HANDICAPS

1. Seldom can the Adjuster speak to us.
	> “Adjusters are playing the sacred and superb game of the ages; they are engaged in one of the supreme adventures of time in space. And how happy they are when your co–operation permits them to lend assistance in your short struggles of time as they continue to prosecute their larger tasks of eternity. But usually, when your Adjuster attempts to communicate with you, the message is lost in the material currents of the energy streams of human mind; only occasionally do you catch an echo, a faint and distant echo, of the divine voice.” <a id="s399_542"></a>[UB 110:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_1)
2. We can lessen the Adjuster’s problem.
	> “May I admonish you to heed the distant echo of the Adjuster’s faithful call to your soul? The indwelling Adjuster cannot stop or even materially alter your career struggle of time; the Adjuster cannot lessen the hardships of life as you journey on through this world of toil. The divine indweller can only patiently forbear while you fight the battle of life as it is lived on your planet; but you could, if you only would—as you work and worry, as you fight and toil—permit the valiant Adjuster to fight with you and for you. You could be so comforted and inspired, so enthralled and intrigued, if you would only allow the Adjuster constantly to bring forth the pictures of the real motive, the final aim, and the eternal purpose of all this difficult, uphill struggle with the commonplace problems of your present material world.” <a id="s401_837"></a>[UB 111:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_2)
3. How we can aid the Adjuster.
	> “Why do you not aid the Adjuster in the task of showing you the spiritual counterpart of all these strenuous material efforts? Why do you not allow the Adjuster to strengthen you with the spiritual truths of cosmic power while you wrestle with the temporal difficulties of creature existence: Why do you not encourage the heavenly helper to cheer you with the clear vision of the eternal outlook of universal life as you gaze in perplexity at the problems of the passing hour? Why do you refuse to be enlightened and inspired by the universe viewpoint while you toil amidst the handicaps of time and flounder in the maze of uncertainties which beset your mortal life journey? Why not allow the Adjuster to spiritualize your thinking, even though your feet must tread the material paths of earthly endeavor?” <a id="s403_811"></a>[UB 111:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_3)
4. The recital of an Adjuster’s problems.
	> “The higher human races of Urantia are complexly admixed; they are a blend of many races and stocks of different origin. This composite nature renders it exceedingly difficult for the Monitors to work efficiently during life and adds definitely to the problems of both the Adjuster and the guardian seraphim after death. Not long since I was present on Salvington and heard a guardian of destiny present a formal statement in extenuation of the difficulties of ministering to her mortal subject. This seraphim said:
	> 
	> “‘Much of my difficulty was due to the unending conflict between the two natures of my subject: the urge of ambition opposed by animal indolence; the ideals of a superior people crossed by the instincts of an inferior race; the high purposes of a great mind antagonized by the urge of a primitive inheritance; the long–distance view of a far–seeing Monitor counteracted by the nearsightedness of a creature of time; the progressive plans of an ascending being modified by the desires and longings of a material nature; the flashes of universe intelligence cancelled by the chemical–energy mandates of the evolving race; the urge of angels opposed by the emotions of an animal; the training of an intellect annulled by the tendencies of instinct; the experience of the individual opposed by the accumulated propensities of the race; the aims of the best overshadowed by the drift of the worst; the flight of genius neutralized by the gravity of mediocrity; the progress of the good retarded by the inertia of the bad; the art of the beautiful besmirched by the presence of evil; the buoyancy of health neutralized by the debility of disease; the fountain of faith polluted by the poisons of fear; the spring of joy embittered by the waters of sorrow; the gladness of anticipation disillusioned by the bitterness of realization; the joys of living ever threatened by the sorrows of death. Such a life on such a planet I And yet, because of the ever–present help and urge of the Thought Adjuster, this soul did achieve a fair degree of happiness and success and has even now ascended to the judgment halls of mansonia.” <a id="s407_1620"></a>[UB 111:7.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_4)
5. Results of aborted Adjuster communication.
	> “There exists a vast gulf between the human and the divine, between man and God. The Urantia races are so largely electrically and chemically controlled, so highly animallike in their common behavior, so emotional in their ordinary reactions, that it becomes exceedingly difficult for the Monitors to guide and direct them. You are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co–operation that your indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. Even when they do find it possible to flash a gleam of new truth to the evolving mortal soul, this spiritual revelation often so blinds the creature as to precipitate a convulsion of fanaticism or to initiate some other intellectual upheaval which results disastrously. Many a new religion and strange "ism" has arisen from the aborted, imperfect, misunderstood, and garbled communications of the Thought Adjusters.” <a id="s409_918"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5)
6. Subconscious and superconscious in relation to Adjusters.
	> “Certain abrupt presentations of thoughts, conclusions, and other pictures of mind are sometimes the direct or indirect work of the Adjuster; but far more often they are the sudden emergence into consciousness of ideas which have been grouping themselves together in the submerged mental levels, natural and everyday occurrences of normal and ordinary psychic function inherent in the circuits of the evolving animal mind. (In contrast with these subconscious emanations, the revelations of the Adjuster appear through the realms of the superconscious.)” <a id="s411_558"></a>[UB 110:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_3)
7. What can’t be done here, will be done over there.
	> “Trust all matters of mind beyond the dead level of consciousness to the custody of the Adjusters. In due time, if not in this world then on the mansion worlds, they will give good account of their stewardship, and eventually will they bring forth those meanings and values intrusted to their care and keeping. They will resurrect every worthy treasure of the mortal mind if you survive.” <a id="s413_392"></a>[UB 110:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_4)
8. Manifold handicaps of the Adjuster.
	> “But your unsteady and rapidly shifting mental attitudes often result in thwarting the plans and interrupting the work of the Adjusters. Their work is not only interfered with by the innate natures of the mortal races, but this ministry is also greatly retarded by your own preconceived opinions, settled ideas, and long–standing prejudices. Because of these handicaps, many times only their unfinished creations emerge into consciousness, and confusion of concept is inevitable. Therefore, in scrutinizing mental situations, safety lies only in the prompt recognition of each and every thought and experience for just what it actually and fundamentally is, disregarding entirely what it might have been.” <a id="s415_709"></a>[UB 109:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_3)
9. Do not identify conscience with Adjusters.
	> “Do not confuse and confound the mission and influence of the Adjuster with what is commonly called conscience; they are not directly related. Conscience is a human and purely psychic reaction. It is not to be despised, but it is hardly the voice of God to the soul, which indeed the Adjuster’s would be if such a voice could be heard. Conscience, rightly, admonishes you to do right; but the Adjuster, in addition, endeavors to tell you what truly is right; that is, when and as you are able to perceive the Monitor’s leading.” <a id="s417_532"></a>[UB 110:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_1)
10. Relation of Adjusters to dreams.
	> “Man’s dream experiences, that disordered and disconnected parade of the un–co–ordinated sleeping mind, present adequate proof of the failure of the Adjusters to harmonize and associate the divergent factors of the mind of man. The Adjusters simply cannot, in a single lifetime, arbitrarily co–ordinate and synchronize two such unlike and diverse types of thinking as the human and the divine. When they do, as they sometimes have, such souls are translated directly to the mansion worlds without the necessity of passing through the experience of death. <a id="s419_558"></a>[UB 110:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_2)
	> 
	> “It is extremely dangerous to postulate as to the Adjuster content of the dream life. The Adjusters do work during sleep, but your ordinary dream experiences are purely physiologic and psychologic phenomena. Likewise, it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjusters’ concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal conscience. These are problems which will have to be solved through individual discrimination and personal decision. But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster’s expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity. Remember, the influence of a Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, a superconscious experience.” <a id="s421_847"></a>[UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)
11. Dangerous ideas regarding the Adjuster’s voice.
	> “In varying degrees and increasingly as you ascend the psychic circles, sometimes directly, but more often indirectly, you do communicate with your Adjusters. But it is dangerous to entertain the idea that every new concept originating in the human mind is the dictation of the Adjuster. More often, in beings of your order, that which you accept as the Adjuster’s voice is in reality the emanation of your own intellect. This is dangerous ground, and every human being must settle these problems for himself in accordance with his natural human wisdom and superhuman insight.” <a id="s423_581"></a>[UB 110:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_6)

### XVIII. ATTAINMENT OF IMMORTALITY

1. Achievement of psychic circles is not Adjuster fusion.
	> “The achievement of the seven cosmic circles does not equal Adjuster fusion. There are many mortals living on Urantia who have attained their circles; but fusion depends on yet other greater and more sublime spiritual achievements, upon the attainment of a final and complete attunement of the mortal will with the will of God as it is resident in the Thought Adjuster.” <a id="s428_374"></a>[UB 110:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_1)
2. Adjuster fusion can occur before physical death.
	> “When a human being has completed the circles of cosmic achievement, and further, when the final choosing of the mortal will permits the Adjuster to complete the association of human identity with the morontial soul during evolutionary and physical life, then do such consummated liaisons of soul and Adjuster go on independently to the mansion worlds, and there is issued the mandate from Uversa which provides for the immediate fusion of the Adjuster and the morontial soul. This fusion during physical life instantly consumes the material body; the human beings who might witness such a spectacle would only observe the translating mortal disappear ‘in chariots of fire.’” <a id="s430_679"></a>[UB 110:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_2)
3. Translating Adjusters are usually highly experienced.
	> “Most Adjusters who have translated their subjects from Urantia were highly experienced and of record as previous indwellers of numerous mortals on other spheres. Remember, Adjusters gain valuable indwelling experience on planets of the loan order; it does not follow that Adjusters only gain experience for advanced work in those mortal subjects who fail to survive.” <a id="s432_372"></a>[UB 110:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_3)
4. The potentials of the oneness of Adjuster fusion.
	> “Subsequent to mortal fusion the Adjusters share your destiny and experience; _they are you_. After the fusion of the immortal morontia soul and the associated Adjuster, all of the experience and all of the values of the one eventually become the possession of the other, so that the two are actually one entity. In a certain sense, this new being is of the eternal past as well as for the eternal future. All that was once human in the surviving soul and all that is experientially divine in the Adjuster now become the actual possession of the new and ever–ascending universe personality. But on each universe level the Adjuster can endow the new creature only with those attributes which are meaningful and of value on that level. An absolute _oneness_ with the divine Monitor, a complete exhaustion of the endowment of an Adjuster, can only be achieved in eternity subsequent to the final attainment of the Universal Father, the Father of spirits, ever the source of these divine gifts.” <a id="s434_995"></a>[UB 110:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_4)
5. Few Urantians can expect translation.
	> “But with the vast majority of Urantians the Adjuster must patiently await the arrival of death deliverance; must await the liberation of the emerging soul from the well–nigh complete domination of the energy patterns and chemical forces inherent in your material order of existence. The chief difficulty you experience in contacting with your Adjusters consists in this very inherent material nature. So few mortals are real thinkers; you do not spiritually develop and discipline your minds to the point of favorable liaison with the divine Adjusters. The ear of the human mind is almost deaf to the spiritual please which the Adjuster translates from the manifold messages of the universal broadcasts of love proceeding from the Father of mercies. The Adjuster finds it almost impossible to register these inspiring spirit leadings in an animal mind so completely dominated by the chemical and electrical forces inherent in your physical natures.” <a id="s436_954"></a>[UB 110:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_6)
6. Seldom can Adjusters speak to us.
	> “Adjusters rejoice to make contact with the mortal mind; but they must be patient through the long years of silent sojourn during which they are unable to break through animal resistance and directly communicate with you. The higher the Thought Adjusters ascend in the scale of service, the more efficient they become. But never can they greet you, in the flesh, with the same full, sympathetic, and expressionful affection as they will when you discern them mind to mind on the mansion worlds.
	> 
	> [. . .]
	> 
	> “While the voice of the Adjuster is ever within you, most of you will hear it seldom during a lifetime. Human beings below the third and second circles of attainment rarely hear the Adjuster’s direct voice except in moments of supreme desire, in a supreme situation, and consequent upon a supreme decision.” <a id="s442_311"></a>[UB 110:7.7-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_7)
7. A personal message from an Adjuster.
	> “During the making and breaking of a contact between the mortal mind of a destiny reservist and the planetary supervisors, sometimes the indwelling Adjuster is so situated that it becomes possible to transmit a message to the mortal partner. Not long since, on Urantia, such a message was transmitted by a self–acting Adjuster to the human associate, a member of the reserve corps of destiny. This message was introduced by these words: ‘And now, without injury or jeopardy to the subject of my solicitous devotion and without intent to overchastise or discourage, for me, make record of this my plea to him.’ Then followed a beautifully touching and appealing admonition. Among other things, the Adjuster pleaded ‘that he more faithfully give me his sincere co–operation, more cheerfully endure the tasks of my emplacement, more faithfully carry out the program of my arrangement, more patiently go through the trials of my selection, more persistently and cheerfully tread the path of my choosing, more humbly receive credit that may accrue as a result of my ceaseless endeavors—thus transmit my admonition to the man of my indwelling. Upon him I bestow the supreme devotion and affection of a divine spirit. And say further to my beloved subject that I will function with wisdom and power until the very end, until the last earth struggle is over; I will be true to my personality trust. And I exhort him to survival, not to disappoint me, not to deprive me of the reward of my patient and intense struggle. On the human will our achievement of personality depends. Circle by circle I have patiently ascended this human mind, and I have testimony that I am meeting the approval of the chief of my kind. Circle by circle I am passing on to judgment. I await with pleasure and without apprehension the roll call of destiny; I am prepared to submit all to the tribunals of the Ancients of Days.’” <a id="s444_1900"></a>[UB 110:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_10)
8. Adjuster is the potential of immortality.
	> “The sending of Adjusters, their indwelling, is indeed one of the unfathomable mysteries of God the Father. These fragments of the divine nature of the Universal Father carry with them the potential of creature immortality. Adjusters are immortal spirits, and union with them confers eternal life upon the soul of the fused mortal.” <a id="s446_336"></a>[UB 40:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_1)

### XIX. THOUGHT ADJUSTERS AFTER DEATH

1. At death Adjusters return to Divinington.
	> “When death of a material, intellectual, or spiritual nature occurs, the Adjuster bids farewell to the mortal host and departs for Divinington. From the headquarters of the local universe and the superuniverse a reflective contact is made with the supervisors of both governments, and the Monitor is registered out by the same number that recorded entry into the domains of time.” <a id="s451_384"></a>[UB 112:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p4_1)
2. At death Adjuster returns to the Father.
	> “When Thought Adjusters return to the Father, they go back to the realm of supposed origin, Divinington; and probably as a part of this experience, there is actual contact with the Father’s Paradise personality as well as with the specialized manifestation of the Father’s divinity which is reported to be situated on this secret sphere.” <a id="s453_342"></a>[UB 107:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p3_2)
3. Three kinds of death are recognized.
	> “1. _Spiritual (soul) death_. If and when mortal man has finally rejected survival, when he has been pronounced spiritually insolvent, morontially bankrupt, in the conjoint opinion of the Adjuster and the surviving seraphim, when such co–ordinate advice has been recorded on Uversa, and after the Censors and their reflective associates have verified these findings, thereupon do the rulers of Orvonton order the immediate release of the indwelling Monitor. But this release of the Adjuster in no way affects the duties of the personal or group seraphim concerned with that Adjuster–abandoned individual. This kind of death is final in its significance irrespective of the temporary continuation of the living energies of the physical and mind mechanisms. From the cosmic standpoint the mortal is already dead; the continuing life merely indicates the persistence of the material momentum of cosmic energies.
	> 
	> “2. _Intellectual (mind) death_. When the vital circuits of higher adjutant ministry are disrupted through the aberrations of intellect or because of the partial destruction of the mechanism of the brain, and if these conditions pass a certain critical point of irreparability, the indwelling Adjuster is immediately released to depart for Divinington. On the universe records a mortal personality is considered to have met with death whenever the essential mind circuits of human will–action have been destroyed. And again, this is death, irrespective of the continuing function of the living mechanism of the physical body. The body minus the volitional mind is no longer human, but according to the prior choosing of the human will, the soul of such an individual may survive.
	> 
	> “3. _Physical (body and mind) death_. When death overtakes a human being, the Adjuster remains in the citadel of the mind until it ceases to function as an intelligent mechanism, about the time that the measurable brain energies cease their rhythmic vital pulsations. Following this dissolution the Adjuster takes leave of the vanishing mind, just as unceremoniously as entry was made years before, and proceeds to Divinington by way of Uversa.” <a id="s459_449"></a>[UB 112:3.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_1)
4. Two factors survive death.
	> “After death the material body returns to the elemental world from which it was derived, but two nonmaterial factors of surviving personality persist: The pre–existent Thought Adjuster, with the memory transcription of the mortal career, proceeds to Divinington; and there also remains, in the custody of the destiny guardian, the immortal morontia soul of the deceased human. These phases and forms of soul, these once kinetic but now static formulas of identity, are essential to repersonalization on the morontia worlds; and it is the reunion of the Adjuster and the soul that reassembles the surviving personality, that reconsciousizes you at the time of the morontia awakening.
	> 
	> “For those who do not have personal seraphic guardians, the group custodians faithfully and efficiently perform the same service of identity safekeeping and personality resurrection. The seraphim, are indispensable to the reassembly of personality.” <a id="s463_253"></a>[UB 112:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_4)
5. Personality and identity differentiated.
	> “Upon death the Thought Adjuster temporarily loses personality, but not identity; the human subject temporarily loses identity, but not personality; on the mansion worlds both reunite in eternal manifestation. Never does a departed Thought Adjuster return to earth as the being of former indwelling; never is personality manifested without the human will; and never does a dis–Adjustered human being after death manifest active identity or in any manner establish communication with the living beings of earth. Such dis–Adjustered souls are wholly and absolutely unconscious during the long or short sleep of death. There can be no exhibition of any sort of personality or ability to engage in communications with other personalities until after completion of survival. Those who go to the mansion worlds are not permitted to send messages back to their loved ones. It is the policy throughout the universes to forbid such communication during the period of a current dispensation.” <a id="s465_986"></a>[UB 112:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_7)
6. Thought Adjuster and memory.
	> “The mortal–mind transcripts and the active creature–memory patterns as transformed from the material levels to the spiritual are the individual possession of the detached Thought Adjusters; these spiritized factors of mind, memory, and creature personality are forever a part of such Adjusters. The creature mind–matrix and the passive potentials of identity are present in the morontia soul intrusted to the keeping of the seraphic destiny guardians. And it is the reuniting of the morontia–soul trust of the seraphim and the spirit–mind trust of the Adjuster that reassembles creature personality and constitutes resurrection of a sleeping survivor.” <a id="s467_657"></a>[UB 47:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_3)
7. Adjuster’s memory discrimination.
	> “Even with Adjuster–fusion candidates, only those human experiences which were of spiritual value are common possessions of the surviving mortal and the returning Adjuster and hence are immediately remembered subsequent to mortal survival. Concerning those happenings which were not of spiritual significance, even these Adjuster–fusers must depend upon the attribute of recognition–response in the surviving soul. And since any one event may have a spiritual connotation to one mortal but not to another, it becomes possible for a group of contemporary ascenders from the same planet to pool their store of Adjuster–remembered events and thus to reconstruct any experience which they had in common, and which was of spiritual value in the life of any one of them.” <a id="s469_769"></a>[UB 40:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p9_7)

### XX. THOUGHT ADJUSTER FUSION

1. The period of Adjuster courtship.
	> “Today you are passing through the period of the courtship of your Adjuster; and if you only prove faithful to the trust reposed in you by the divine spirit who seeks your mind and soul in eternal union, there will eventually ensue that morontia oneness, that supernal harmony, that cosmic co–ordination, that divine attunement, that celestial fusion, that never–ending blending of identity, that oneness of being which is so perfect and final that even the most experienced personalities can never segregate or recognize as separate identities the fusion partners –– mortal man and divine Adjuster.” <a id="s474_604"></a>[UB 110:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_6)
2. Fusion makes God and man one.
	> “Thought Adjuster fusion imparts eternal actualities to personality which were previously only potential. Among these new endowments may be mentioned: fixation of divinity quality, past–eternity experience and memory, immortality, and a phase of qualified potential absoluteness.
	> 
	> “When your earthly course in temporary form has been run, you are to awaken on the shores of a better world, and eventually you will be united with your faithful Adjuster in an eternal embrace. And this fusion constitutes the mystery of making God and man one, the mystery of finite creature evolution, but it is eternally true. Fusion is the secret of the sacred sphere of Ascendington, and no creature, save those who have experienced fusion with the spirit of Deity, can comprehend the true meaning of the actual values which are conjoined when the identity of a creature of time becomes eternally one with the spirit of Paradise Deity.” <a id="s478_644"></a>[UB 112:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_1)
3. Fusion ends all danger of failure.
	> “When fusion with the Adjuster has been effected, there can be no future danger to the eternal career of such a personality. Celestial beings are tested throughout a long experience, but mortals pass through a relatively short and intensive testing on the evolutionary and morontia worlds.” <a id="s480_294"></a>[UB 112:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_4)
4. Where fusion usually occurs.
	> “Fusion with the Adjuster is usually effected while the ascender is resident within his local system. It may occur on the planet of nativity as a transcendence of natural death; it may take place on any one of the mansion worlds or on the headquarters of the system; it may even be delayed until the time of the constellation sojourn; or, in special instances, it may not be consummated until the ascender is on the local universe capital.” <a id="s482_444"></a>[UB 112:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_3)
5. Adoption of the new name.
	> “Human subjects are often known by the numbers of their Adjusters; mortals do not receive real universe names until after Adjuster fusion, which union is signalized by the bestowal of the new name upon the new creature by the destiny guardian.” <a id="s484_248"></a>[UB 108:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p3_3)
6. What Adjuster fusion means.
	> “From the time of Adjuster fusion the status of the ascender is that of the evolutionary creature. The human member was the first to enjoy personality and, therefore, outranks the Adjuster in all matters concerned with the recognition of personality. The Paradise headquarters of this fused being is Ascendington, not Divinington, and this unique combination of God and man ranks as an ascending mortal all the way up to the Corps of the Finality.
	> 
	> “When once an Adjuster fuses with an ascending mortal, the number of that Adjuster is stricken from the records of the superuniverse. What happens on the records of Divinington, I do not know, but I surmise that the registry of that Adjuster is removed to the secret circles of the inner courts of Grandfanda, the acting head of the Corps of the Finality.
	> 
	> “With Adjuster fusion the Universal Father has completed his promise of the gift of himself to his material creatures; he has fulfilled the promise, and consummated the plan, of the eternal bestowal of divinity upon humanity. Now begins the human attempt to realize and to actualize the limitless possibilities that are inherent in the supernal partnership with God which has thus factualized.” <a id="s490_398"></a>[UB 112:7.12-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_12)
7. Fusion makes sonship a fact.
	> “Your own races of surviving mortals belong to this group of the ascending Sons of God. You are now planetary sons, evolutionary creatures derived from the Life Carrier implantations and modified by the Adamic–life infusion, hardly yet ascending sons; but you are indeed sons of ascension potential—even to the highest heights of glory and divinity attainment—and this spiritual status of ascending sonship you may attain by faith and by freewill co–operation with the spiritualizing activities of the indwelling Adjuster. When you and your Adjusters are finally and forever fused, when you two are made one, even as in Christ Michael the Son of God and the Son of Man are one, then in fact have you become the ascending sons of God.” <a id="s492_738"></a>[UB 40:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_2)
8. The Adjuster wins personality.
	> “Has the triumphant Adjuster won personality by the magnificent service to humanity, or has the valiant human acquired immortality through sincere efforts to achieve Adjusterlikeness? It is neither; but they together have achieved the evolution of a member of one of the unique orders of the ascending personalities of the Supreme, one who will ever be found serviceable, faithful, and efficient, a candidate for further growth and development, ever ranging upward and never ceasing the supernal ascent until the seven circuits of Havona have been traversed and the onetime soul of earthly origin stands in worshipful recognition of the actual personality of the Father on Paradise.” <a id="s494_687"></a>[UB 112:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_9)
9. The potentials of Adjuster fusion.
	> “Fusion with a fragment of the Universal Father is equivalent to a divine validation of eventual Paradise attainment, and such Adjuster–fused mortals are the only class of human beings who all traverse the Havona circuits and find God on Paradise. To the Adjuster–fused mortal the career of universal service is wide open. What dignity of destiny and glory of attainment await every one of you! Do you fully appreciate what has been done for you? Do you comprehend the grandeur of the heights of eternal achievement which are spread out before you?—even you who now trudge on in the lowly path of life through your so–called ‘vale of tears’?” <a id="s496_646"></a>[UB 40:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_5)
10. Experience of nonfusion Adjusters.
	> “An experiential Adjuster remains with a primitive human being throughout his entire lifetime in the flesh. The Adjusters contribute much to the advancement of primitive men but are unable to form eternal unions with such mortals. This transient ministry of the Adjusters accomplishes two things: First, they gain valuable and actual experience in the nature and working of the evolutionary intellect, an experience which will be invaluable in connection with later contacts on other worlds with beings of higher development. Second, the transient sojourn of the Adjusters contributes much towards preparing their mortal subjects for possible subsequent Spirit fusion. All God–seeking souls of this type achieve eternal life through the spiritual embrace of the Mother Spirit of the local universe, thus becoming ascending mortals of the local universe regime. Many persons from pre–Adamic Urantia were thus advanced to the mansion worlds of Satania.” <a id="s498_955"></a>[UB 40:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_10)

### XXI. JESUS’ THOUGHT ADJUSTER

1. Arrival of Jesus’ Adjuster.
	> “In something more than a year after the return to Nazareth the boy Jesus arrived at the age of his first personal and wholehearted moral decision; and there came to abide with him a Thought Adjuster, a divine gift of the Paradise Father, which had aforetime served with Machiventa Melchizedek, thus gaining the experience of functioning in connection with the incarnation of a supermortal being living in the likeness of mortal flesh. This event occurred on February 11, 2 B.C. Jesus was no more aware of the coming of the divine Monitor than are the millions upon millions of other children who, before and since that day, have likewise received these Thought Adjusters to indwell their minds and work for the ultimate spiritualization of these minds and the eternal survival of their evolving immortal souls.” <a id="s503_816"></a>[UB 123:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_1)
2. The personalization of Jesus’ Adjuster.
	> “Ordinarily, when a mortal of the realm attains such high levels of personality perfection, there occur those preliminary phenomena of spiritual elevation which terminate in eventual fusion of the matured soul of the mortal with its associated divine Adjuster. And such a change was apparently due to take place in the personality experience of Jesus of Nazareth on that very day when he went down into the Jordan with his two brothers to be baptized by John. This ceremony was the final act of his purely human life on Urantia, and many superhuman observers expected to witness the fusion of the Adjuster with its indwelt mind, but they were all destined to suffer disappointment. Something new and even greater occurred. As John laid his hands upon Jesus to baptize him, the indwelling Adjuster took final leave of the perfected human soul of Joshua ben Joseph. And in a few moments this divine entity returned from Divinington as a Personalized Adjuster and chief of his kind throughout the entire local universe of Nebadon. Thus did Jesus observe his own former divine spirit descending on its return to him in personalized form. And he heard this same spirit of Paradise origin now speak, saying, ‘This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.’ And John, with Jesus’ two brothers, also heard these words. John’s disciples, standing by the water’s edge, did not hear these words, neither did they see the apparition of the Personalized Adjuster. Only the eyes of Jesus beheld the Personalized Adjuster. <a id="s505_1514"></a>[UB 136:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3)
3. Experience and function of Jesus’ Adjuster.
	> “The activities of Adjusters in your local universe are directed by the Personalized Adjuster of Michael of Nebadon, that very Monitor who guided him step by step when he lived his human life in the flesh of Joshua ben Joseph. Faithful to his trust was this extraordinary Adjuster, and wisely did this valiant Monitor direct the human nature, ever guiding the mortal mind of the Paradise Son in the choosing of the path of the Father’s perfect will. This Adjuster had previously served with Machiventa Melchizedek in the days of Abraham and had engaged in tremendous exploits both previous to this indwelling and between these bestowal experiences.” <a id="s507_653"></a>[UB 109:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_4)
4. Function of Personalized Adjusters.
	> “We cannot state whether or not non–Adjuster Father fragments are personalizable, but you have been informed that personality is the sovereign freewill bestowal of the Universal Father. As far as we know, the Adjuster type of Father fragment attains personality only by the acquirement of personal attributes through service–ministry to a personal being. These Personalized Adjusters are at home on Divinington, where they instruct and direct their prepersonal associates.
	> 
	> “Personalized Thought Adjusters are the untrammeled, unassigned, and sovereign stabilizers and compensators of the far–flung universe of universes. They combine the Creator and creature experience—existential and experiential. They are conjoint time and eternity beings. They associate the prepersonal and the personal in universe administration.
	> 
	> “Personalized Adjusters are the all–wise and powerful executives of the Architects of the Master Universe. They are the personal agents of the full ministry of the Universal Father—personal, prepersonal, and superpersonal. They are the personal ministers of the extraordinary, the unusual, and the unexpected throughout all the realms of the transcendental absonite spheres of the domain of God the Ultimate, even to the levels of God the Absolute.
	> 
	> “They are the exclusive beings of the universes who embrace within their being all the known relationships of personality; they are omnipersonal—they are before personality, they are personality, and they are after personality.

### XXII. TABAMANTIA’S TRIBUTE TO ADJUSTERS

> “It is interesting to note that local universe inspectors always address themselves, when carrying out a planetary examination, to the planetary chief of Thought Adjusters, just as they deliver charges to the chiefs of seraphim and to the leaders of other orders of beings attached to the administration of an evolving world. Not long since, Urantia underwent such a periodic inspection by Tabamantia, the sovereign supervisor of all life—experiment planets in the universe of Nebadon. And the records reveal that, in addition to his admonitions and indictments delivered to the various chiefs of superhuman personalities, he also delivered the following acknowledgment to the chief of Adjusters, whether located on the planet, on Salvington, Uversa, or Divinington, we do not definitely know, but he said:
> 
> “‘Now to you, superiors far above me, I come as one placed in temporary authority over the experimental planetary series; and I come to express admiration and profound respect for this magnificent group of celestial ministers, the Mystery Monitors, who have volunteered to serve on this irregular sphere. No matter how trying the crises, you never falter. Not on the records of Nebadon nor before the commissions of Orvonton has there ever been offered an indictment of a divine Adjuster. You have been true to your trusts; you have been divinely faithful. You have helped to adjust the mistakes and to compensate for the shortcomings of all who labor on this” confused planet. You are marvelous beings, guardians of the good in the souls of this backward realm. I pay you respect even while you are apparently under my jurisdiction as volunteer ministers. I bow before you in humble recognition of your exquisite unselfishness, your understanding ministry, and your impartial devotion. You deserve the name of the Godlike servers of the mortal inhabitants of this strife–torn, grief–stricken, and disease–afflicted world. I honor you! I all but worship you!’” <a id="s521_1163"></a>[UB 108:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p3_5)
