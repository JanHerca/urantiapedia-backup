## I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. While reason demands monotheistic unity, experience requires diversity of Absolutes—even differentials, variables, modifiers, and qualifiers. [UB 104:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p3_4)
2. The analysis of dead protoplasm does not disclose the true nature of living protoplasm. [UB 65:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_1)
3. Pulsating stars give origin to solar systems. [UB 41:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_1)
4. Both mental and spiritual transformations may occur suddenly. [UB 65:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p8_6)
5. In the evolutionary universes energy-matter is dominant, except in personality, where spirit, through the mediation of mind, is struggling for the mastery. [UB 116:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p6_1)
6. Land is the stage of society; men are the actors. [UB 68:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_1)

## II. MIND SYSTEMS

1. The potential to learn from experience marks the functioning of the adjutant spirits. [UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)
2. The universe is mind planned, mind made, and mind administered. [UB 42:11.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_2)
3. Mind levels:
	- Preadjutant spirit minds.
	- Adjutant spirit minds.
	- Morontia minds.
	- Cosmic mind. [UB 42:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_2)
4. Physics and chemistry alone cannot explain how a human being evolves out of primeval protoplasm. [UB 65:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_8)

## III. UNIVERSE MECHANISMS

1. The evolution of universe mechanisms indicates the presence and dominance of creative mind. [UB 42:12.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_1)
2. The higher the mind associated with a universe phenomenon, the more difficult is its detection. [UB 42:11.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_8)
3. The controlling mind of the universe is infinite and therefore beyond the full discernment of the finite mind. [UB 42:11.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_8)

## IV. LIFE CARRIERS

1. Life Carriers are the living catalyzers who initiate material life; they are the instigators of the energy circuits. [UB 49:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p1_2)
2. The Universe Mother Spirit actually vitalizes the lifeless patterns. [UB 36:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_7)
3. In the human blood stream there exists the possibility of upward of 15,000,000 chemical reactions. [UB 65:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_6)

## V. THE URANTIA ADVENTURE

1. The midwayers have assembled over 50,000 facts of physics and chemistry which are incompatible with the theory of chance in human evolution. [UB 58:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p2_3)
2. Evolution can be delayed but it cannot be stopped. [UB 81:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p0_1)
3. The frog finally culminated in man himself. [UB 65:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_6)
4. The human race has no surviving ancestry between the frog and the Eskimo. [UB 65:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_7)
5. Remember that Urantia was a life-experiment world. [UB 65:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_1)
6. More than a hundred thousand facts prove the presence of mind in the planning of the cosmos. [UB 58:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p2_3)
7. Many bacteria and fungi represent retrograde movement in evolution and explain disease-causing proclivities. [UB 65:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_3)
8. There were two unique features in the Urantia experiment:
	1. The Andonic race appearing before the colored races.
	2. The simultaneous appearance of the six Sangik colored races. [UB 65:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_7)
9. Failure to obtain more of the Adamic life plasm predisposed the human race to many diseases. [UB 65:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p5_2)
