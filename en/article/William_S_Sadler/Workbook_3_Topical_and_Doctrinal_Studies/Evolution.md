## I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. While reason demands monotheistic unity, experience requires diversity of Absolutes—even differentials, variables, modifiers, and qualifiers. <a id="s28_145"></a>[UB 104:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p3_4)
2. The analysis of dead protoplasm does not disclose the true nature of living protoplasm. <a id="s29_91"></a>[UB 65:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_1)
3. Pulsating stars give origin to solar systems. <a id="s30_49"></a>[UB 41:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_1)
4. Both mental and spiritual transformations may occur suddenly. <a id="s31_65"></a>[UB 65:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p8_6)
5. In the evolutionary universes energy-matter is dominant, except in personality, where spirit, through the mediation of mind, is struggling for the mastery. <a id="s32_159"></a>[UB 116:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p6_1)
6. Land is the stage of society; men are the actors. <a id="s33_53"></a>[UB 68:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_1)

## II. MIND SYSTEMS

1. The potential to learn from experience marks the functioning of the adjutant spirits. <a id="s37_89"></a>[UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)
2. The universe is mind planned, mind made, and mind administered. <a id="s38_67"></a>[UB 42:11.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_2)
3. Mind levels:
	- Preadjutant spirit minds.
	- Adjutant spirit minds.
	- Morontia minds.
	- Cosmic mind. <a id="s43_16"></a>[UB 42:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_2)
4. Physics and chemistry alone cannot explain how a human being evolves out of primeval protoplasm. <a id="s44_100"></a>[UB 65:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_8)

## III. UNIVERSE MECHANISMS

1. The evolution of universe mechanisms indicates the presence and dominance of creative mind. <a id="s48_95"></a>[UB 42:12.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_1)
2. The higher the mind associated with a universe phenomenon, the more difficult is its detection. <a id="s49_99"></a>[UB 42:11.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_8)
3. The controlling mind of the universe is infinite and therefore beyond the full discernment of the finite mind. <a id="s50_114"></a>[UB 42:11.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p11_8)

## IV. LIFE CARRIERS

1. Life Carriers are the living catalyzers who initiate material life; they are the instigators of the energy circuits. <a id="s54_120"></a>[UB 49:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p1_2)
2. The Universe Mother Spirit actually vitalizes the lifeless patterns. <a id="s55_72"></a>[UB 36:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_7)

## V. THE URANTIA ADVENTURE

1. The midwayers have assembled over 50,000 facts of physics and chemistry which are incompatible with the theory of chance in human evolution. <a id="s60_144"></a>[UB 58:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p2_3)
