## I. TRINITY UNION OF DEITY

1. God functions as absolute Deity only in the Paradise Trinity and in relation to universe totality. [UB 10:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_1)
2. The Trinity is existential and was inevitable. [UB 0:12.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_1)
3. The Trinity constitutes the only Deity reality embracing infinity. [UB 0:12.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_2)
4. The Trinity facilitates the Father’s escape from personality absolutism. [UB 10:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p0_1)
5. The Trinity is an association of infinite persons as a corporate entity. [UB 10:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p4_3)

## II. FUNCTIONS OF THE TRINITY

1. The Trinity does not have attributes—it has functions, such as justice administration, totality attitudes, co-ordinate action, and cosmic overcontrol. [UB 10:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_1)
2. Justice is one of the functions of the Trinity. [UB 10:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_2)
3. The Paradise Trinity is concerned with totals. The Trinity is the totality of Deity. [UB 10:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p7_2)
4. While the Supreme Being is not a personalization of the Trinity, he is the nearest approach comprehensible by finite creatures. [UB 10:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_4)

## III. SONS OF THE TRINITY

1. There are seven orders of Supreme Trinity Personalities:
	1. Trinitized Secrets of Supremacy.
	2. Eternals of Days.
	3. Ancients of Days.
	4. Perfections of Days.
	5. Recents of Days.
	6. Unions of Days.
	7. Faithfuls of Days. [UB 18:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p0_1)
2. There are seven orders of Co-ordinate Trinity-origin Beings:
	1. Trinity Teacher Sons.
	2. Perfectors of Wisdom.
	3. Divine Counselors.
	4. Universal Censors.
	5. Inspired Trinity Spirits.
	6. Havona Natives.
	7. Paradise Citizens. [UB 19:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p0_1)

## IV. TRINITARIAN CONCEPTS

1. The Trinity is an absolute entity—supersummative Deity. [UB 104:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p2_4)
2. The absolute attitude of the Trinity concerns absolute existences and the action of total Deity. [UB 10:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p5_6)
3. A triunity is not an organic entity—it is functional. [UB 104:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p3_14)
4. The Ultimate Trinity, now evolving, will consist of the Supreme Being, Supreme Creator Personalities, and the Architects of the Master Universe. [UB 0:12.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_6)
5. The Absolute Trinity will consist of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and the Consummator of Universe Destiny. [UB 0:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_7)
