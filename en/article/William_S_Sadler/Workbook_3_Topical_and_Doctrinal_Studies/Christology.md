## I. BEGINNINGS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH

1. The gospel is: the fact of the fatherhood of God, coupled with the truth of the sonship-brotherhood of men. <a id="s28_111"></a>[UB 194:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_4)
2. Unintentionally, some facts associated with the gospel were substituted for the gospel message. <a id="s29_99"></a>[UB 194:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_3)
3. Only baptism was required for admission to the Jesus brotherhood. <a id="s30_69"></a>[UB 194:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_9)
4. The Lord’s Supper was celebrated at the end of a fellowship meal. <a id="s31_69"></a>[UB 194:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_8)
5. At Pentecost, Peter really founded the Christian church. <a id="s32_60"></a>[UB 195:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_1)
6. Paul’s adaptations of Jesus’ gospel were superior to all other religions. <a id="s33_77"></a>[UB 121:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p5_13)
7. Philo’s teachings had considerable influence on Paul. <a id="s34_57"></a>[UB 121:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p6_5)
8. It was the second century before Greco-Roman culture turned to Christianity. <a id="s35_80"></a>[UB 195:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_4)
9. The Christians made shrewd bargains with the pagans, but did not do so well with the Mithraics. <a id="s36_99"></a>[UB 195:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_11)
10. The early plan of Christian worship followed the synagogue and Mithraic rituals. <a id="s37_85"></a>[UB 195:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_6)

## II. CONTENT OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE

1. The Christian concept of God combines three ideas.
	1. Hebrew concept—God a vindicator of moral values—a righteous God.
	2. Greek concept—God as a unifier—a God of wisdom.
	3. Jesus’ concept—God as a living friend, a loving Father. <a id="s44_60"></a>[UB 5:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p4_10)
2. Christianity is a religion about Jesus, modified by much theology. <a id="s45_70"></a>[UB 92:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p6_18)
3. Early Christianity and Mithraism had many things in common. <a id="s46_63"></a>[UB 98:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p6_3)
4. Paul’s theology was based on Jesus’ life, but was also influenced by the Greeks and the Stoics. <a id="s47_99"></a>[UB 121:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p7_7)
5. Christ becomes the creed of the new fellowship. <a id="s48_51"></a>[UB 194:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6)
6. Abner’s more authentic version of the gospel made little progress. <a id="s49_70"></a>[UB 195:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_11)

## III. INFLUENCE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS

1. The Greek Stephen’s death led to the organization of the first church at Jerusalem. <a id="s53_87"></a>[UB 194:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_12)
2. Greek culture was quick to embrace Christianity as a new and better religion. <a id="s54_81"></a>[UB 195:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_5)
3. Christians accepted the Roman Empire; the empire adopted Christianity. <a id="s55_74"></a>[UB 195:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_1)
4. Conditions at Rome were favorable for the adoption of a new religion. <a id="s56_73"></a>[UB 195:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_2)
5. The church, becoming an adjunct of society and an ally of politics, was doomed to suffer during the “dark ages.” <a id="s57_116"></a>[UB 195:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_1)

## IV. THE MODERN PROBLEM

1. Viewing what Christianity has endured indicates great inherent vitality. <a id="s61_76"></a>[UB 195:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_4)
2. Christianity now faces the gigantic struggle between the secular and the spiritual. <a id="s62_87"></a>[UB 195:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_5)
3. Religion needs new leaders—men who will depend solely on the incomparable teachings of Jesus. <a id="s63_97"></a>[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)
4. The hour is striking for the rediscovery of the original foundations of Christianity. <a id="s64_89"></a>[UB 195:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_5)
5. Christianity has become a social and cultural movement as well as a religion. <a id="s65_81"></a>[UB 195:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_11)
6. Christianity is handicapped because it sponsors a society which staggers under a tremendous overload of materialism. <a id="s66_120"></a>[UB 195:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_20)
7. Christianity is threatened by the doom of one of its own slogans: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” <a id="s67_116"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11)
8. But Christianity contains enough of the teachings of Jesus to immortalize it. <a id="s68_81"></a>[UB 195:10.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_18)
9. The hope of Christianity is that it shall learn anew the greatest of all truths—the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. <a id="s69_133"></a>[UB 195:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21)

## V. MATERIALISM

1. If man were only a machine, he could not formulate his materialistic concepts. <a id="s73_82"></a>[UB 195:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_3)
2. Machines do not struggle to find God nor strive to be like him. <a id="s74_67"></a>[UB 195:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_14)
3. Man exhibits the control attributes of mind and the creative qualities of spirit. <a id="s75_85"></a>[UB 195:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_9)
4. Religion is not so much concerned with science, morality, and philosophy—as it is with the scientist, the moralist, and the philosopher. <a id="s76_140"></a>[UB 195:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_18)

## VI. SECULAR TOTALITARIANISM

1. Secularism broke the bonds of church control, and now threatens to establish a new and godless control of men. <a id="s80_114"></a>[UB 195:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_1)
2. World wars are the result of overdoing the secularistic revolt. <a id="s81_67"></a>[UB 195:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_13)
3. Secularism discards ethics and religion for politics and power. <a id="s82_67"></a>[UB 195:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_11)
4. Materialism denies God, secularism simply ignores him. <a id="s83_58"></a>[UB 195:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_5)
5. The majority of Christians are unwittingly secularists. <a id="s84_59"></a>[UB 195:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_3)

## VII. THE RELIGION OF JESUS

1. Jesus is the new and living way whereby man comes into his divine inheritance. <a id="s88_82"></a>[UB 101:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_17)
2. Men evade the religion of Jesus for fear of what it will do to them and with them. <a id="s89_86"></a>[UB 195:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_6)
3. The apostles were demoralized by the Master’s death. <a id="s90_56"></a>[UB 194:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_1)
4. Comes the resurrection—God is no longer a doctrine in their minds; he has become a living presence in their souls. <a id="s91_118"></a>[UB 194:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_2)
5. Paul’s Christianity made sure of the divine Christ, but almost wholly lost sight of the human Jesus. <a id="s92_104"></a>[UB 196:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_4)
6. Jesus founded a religion of personal experience in doing the will of God; Paul founded a religion for the worship of the glorified and risen Christ. <a id="s93_152"></a>[UB 196:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_5)
7. Jesus did not found the Christian church, but he has fostered it. <a id="s94_69"></a>[UB 195:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_9)
8. The Oriental peoples do not know that there is a religion _of_ Jesus as well as a religion _about_ Jesus. <a id="s95_109"></a>[UB 195:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_15)
9. The time is ripe for the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from the burial tomb of theologic traditions and religious dogmas. <a id="s96_138"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2)
10. You can preach a religion about Jesus, but you must _live_ the religion of Jesus. <a id="s97_86"></a>[UB 196:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_1)
11. The New Testament is a superb Christian document, but it is only meagerly Jesusonian. <a id="s98_90"></a>[UB 196:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_1)
