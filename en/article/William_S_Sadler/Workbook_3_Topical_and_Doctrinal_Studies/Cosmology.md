## I. THE COSMIC CENTER

1. Paradise is the absolute source and the eternal focal point of all energy-matter in the universe of universes. [UB 11:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_9)
2. We are not sure about the relation of the Unqualified Absolute to space motion. We think the Conjoint Actor initiates motion in space. [UB 12:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_2)
3. The Unqualified Absolute pervades all space. [UB 12:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_13)
4. The diverse levels of creation are unified by a divine plan and eternal purpose. [UB 56:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p0_2)

## II. PARADISE GRAVITY

1. The Universal Father is infinite and acts over _all_ four absolute gravity circuits. [UB 12:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_1)
2. Gravity is the omnipotent strand on which are strung the gleaming stars, blazing suns, and whirling spheres which constitute the universal physical adornment of the eternal God. [UB 11:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_1)
3. The center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise. [UB 11:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_2)
4. Every form of known reality has the bend of the ages, the trend of the circle, the swing of the great ellipse. [UB 11:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_2)
5. The Unqualified Absolute is the revealer, regulator, and repository of all that which has origin in Paradise. [UB 11:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_9)

## III. SPACE

1. All space alternately contracts and expands. [UB 11:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_1)
2. Pervaded space is now nearing the mid-point of the expansion phase. [UB 11:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p6_4)
3. Space is real—it contains and conditions motion. [UB 12:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_7)
4. Space comes the nearest of all nonabsolute things to being absolute. [UB 118:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_5)
5. We do not know if an idea occupies space. We are sure that an idea pattern does not contain space. [UB 118:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_7)
6. Man’s mind is less time-bound than space-bound. [UB 12:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_5)
7. Time and space are a conjoined mechanism of the master universe. [UB 118:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p9_1)
8. The apparent velocity of the supposedly “exploding” universe is not real. [UB 12:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_14)
9. All cosmic space levels are separated by relative quiescent space zones. [UB 11:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_7)

## IV. UNIVERSE OVERCONTROL

1. Universe stability is the result of balanced energies, co-operative minds, co-ordinated morontias, spirit overcontrol, and personality unification. [UB 12:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_1)
2. The master universe is fostered by the Paradise Trinity. [UB 12:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_8)
3. The universes are unified. God is one in power and personality. [UB 56:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p9_14)
4. The absonite architects eventuate a universe plan. The Supreme Creators materialize it, the Supreme Being will consummate it. [UB 106:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p3_1)

## V. THE SUPERUNIVERSES

1. The grand universe is the present organized and inhabited creation. [UB 12:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13)
2. Orvonton, the seventh superuniverse, is the Milky Way. [UB 15:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_1)
3. The rotational center of our minor sector is Sagittarius. [UB 15:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_5)
4. Uversa, the capital of Orvonton, is the administrative headquarters for one trillion inhabited worlds. [UB 15:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_11)
5. It is on such worlds as Uversa that the beings representative of the autocracy of perfection and the democracy of evolution meet face to face. [UB 15:11.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p11_1)
6. A superuniverse government is directed by one of the Seven Master Spirits, through one of the Seven Supreme Executives. [UB 15:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p10_1)

## VI. ASTRONOMY

1. Of the ten major divisions of Orvonton, eight have been roughly identified by Urantia astronomers. [UB 15:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_4)
2. The Universe Power Directors have ability to condense and contain, or to expand and liberate, varying quantities of energy. [UB 15:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p8_4)
3. The universes are engaged in an orderly and perfectly controlled procession, swinging in majestic grandeur around the First Great Source and Center. [UB 15:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_1)
4. Paradise Force Organizers are nebulae originators. [UB 15:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_4)
5. The superuniverse of Orvonton is illuminated and warned by more than ten trillion blazing suns. [UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10)
6. Only those suns which function in the direct channels of the main streams of universe energy can shine on forever. [UB 41:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p7_14)
7. One half million light-years beyond the grand universe, in the first outer space level, unbelievable action is taking place—extending for twenty-five million light-years. [UB 12:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14)
8. The alternate clockwise and counterclockwise movement of the galaxies is a factor of gravity control and acts as a brake on dangerous velocities. [UB 11:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_9)
9. There is mystery associated with the force-charge of space. It does not respond to gravity, but it ever swings around Paradise. [UB 15:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_1)
10. The mysterious stretches of outer space exhibit the amazing evolution of the plans of the Architects of the Master Universe. [UB 12:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_1)
11. Some suns are solitary; some are double stars. There are also suns that shine without heat. [UB 15:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_8)
12. Light is real. Sunlight would be economical at a million dollars a pound. [UB 41:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p5_2)
