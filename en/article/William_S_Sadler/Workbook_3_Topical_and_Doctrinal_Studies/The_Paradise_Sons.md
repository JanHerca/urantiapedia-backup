The Creator, Magisterial. and Trinity Teacher Sons are the gifts of the eternal Deities to the children of men. <a id="s26_112"></a>[UB 20:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p10_2)

The topic of Creator Sons is covered in another Topical Study. Please click [here.](/en/article/William_S_Sadler/Workbook_3_Topical_and_Doctrinal_Studies/The_Creator_Sons)

## II. MAGISTERIAL SONS

1. Much as the Creator Sons are personalized by the Father and the Son, the Magisterial Sons are personalized by the Son and the Spirit. <a id="s34_137"></a>[UB 7:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p6_5)
2. Every time an original and absolute concept of being formulated by the Eternal Son unites with a new and divine ideal of loving service conceived by the Infinite Spirit, a new and original Magisterial Son is produced. <a id="s35_221"></a>[UB 20:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_1)
3. These Avonal Sons have three functions:
	> 1. Judicial.
	> 2. Magisterial.
	> 3. Bestowal. <a id="s39_16"></a>[UB 20:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_4)
4. Urantia may yet be visited by an Avonal Son to incarnate on a magisterial mission. <a id="s40_86"></a>[UB 20:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_5)
5. The method of these incarnations is a universal mystery. <a id="s41_60"></a>[UB 20:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p6_1)
6. Incarnated Paradise Sons have experienced Adjusters. <a id="s42_56"></a>[UB 20:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p4_3)

8. The attribute of bestowal is inherent in the Paradise Sons. <a id="s44_63"></a>[UB 119:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_2)
9. Avonals are the planetary ministers and judges and number about one billion. <a id="s45_80"></a>[UB 20:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p2_2)
10. The mission of a Magisterial Son is just as effective as that of a Creator Son. <a id="s46_84"></a>[UB 20:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_6)
11. The bestowal of Paradise Sons is not to placate the Heavenly Father. It is part of the experiential training of these Sons. <a id="s47_128"></a>[UB 20:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p5_2)
