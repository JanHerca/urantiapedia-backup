	> (N.B. The statement above is in error: The correct reference is: "It was 1,973 years before the birth of Jesus that Machiventa was bestowed upon the human races of Urantia." ed.)
	{.is-warning}
2. Machiventa spoke several languages and wore a breastplate of three concentric circles. <a id="s31_90"></a>[UB 93:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_5)

3. The Salem cult had three simple beliefs:
	1. I believe in El Elyon, the Universal Father and Creator.
	2. I accept the Melchizedek covenant—the favor of God by faith, not by sacrifices.
	3. I promise to obey the seven commandments. <a id="s42_46"></a>[UB 93:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p4_1)
4. The seven commandments were:
	1. You shall not serve any God but the Most High Creator of heaven and earth.
	2. You shall not doubt that faith is the only requirement for eternal salvation.
	3. You shall not bear false witness.
	4. You shall not kill.
	5. You shall not steal.
	6. You shall not commit adultery.
	7. You shall not show disrespect for your parents and elders. <a id="s50_63"></a>[UB 93:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p4_6)

4. The Abraham covenant provided that God did everything—faith alone gained God’s favor. <a id="s58_89"></a>[UB 93:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_4)
5. Abraham became civil and military leader of the Salem colony. <a id="s59_65"></a>[UB 93:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_8)
