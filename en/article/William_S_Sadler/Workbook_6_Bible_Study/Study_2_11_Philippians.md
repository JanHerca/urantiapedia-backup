## II. Purpose and Occasion

1. The church at Philippi had sent a gift of money to Paul by Epaphroditus, who was stricken with a grave illness, and on recovery brought Paul's letter back to the church at Philippi.
2. This epistle was a letter of thanks for their gift-the only one of its kind Paul ever accepted from one of his churches.
	**Note**: It is thought that Paul got an inheritance from a wealthy relative about the time of his first imprisonment.
3. Here at Philippi Paul made his first effort in Europe, and this became the first Christian church in Europe.
4. He was accompanied by Silas, Timothy, and Luke.
5. The best account of Paul's visit to Philippi is Luke's record in Acts.
6. Paul's imbroglio with the mediumistic slave girl got him in prison and scourged; but his Roman citizenship got him out of trouble.
7. A nocturnal earthquake helped to get Paul and Silas out of jail.
8. Arguments have been presented to show that this letter came from Ephesus or Caesarea, but most authorities agree that it came from Rome.
9. The date is from A.D. 60 to 62.

## III. A Look At The Letter

1. [Phil. 3:8-14](/en/Bible/Philippians/3#v8) is probably the most moving and elevated passage Paul ever wrote.
2. The rhythmical trend of [2:5-11](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v5) suggests that it may have originally been a hymn.
3. Women were prominent in the church at Philippi, notably Lydia. Paul knew about the small cliques and petty rivalries in the church.
4. Paul no longer expected to see the Lord come any day in "the clouds of heaven." He was becoming reconciled to the idea of death.
5. There is little theologic argument in this letter-and it ends differently from his other epistles. The end (see [4:8](/en/Bible/Philippians/4#v8)) is followed by the postscript.
6. The cheerful tone of this letter suggests that Paul was expecting to get out of prison soon.
7. This has been called the "joy" epistle-because the word is so frequently used.
8. This is the most personal and touchingly beautiful of all Paul's letters.
9. Of all Paul's writings this is more like a "letter"-just a friendly message to his flock at Philippi.

## IV. Selected Texts

1. **Paul's wish for us**. "And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ." [1:9,10](/en/Bible/Philippians/1#v9).
2. **Paul's imprisonment**. "And most of the brethren have been made confident of the Lord because of my imprisonment, and are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear." [1:14](/en/Bible/Philippians/1#v14).
3. **The sure profit**. "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." [1:21](/en/Bible/Philippians/1#v21).
4. **True humility**. "Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves." [2:3](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v3).
5. **The incarnation**. "And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross." [2:8](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v8).
6. **Working out salvation**. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." [2:12](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v12).
7. **Sharing the Christ life**. "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death." [3:10](/en/Bible/Philippians/3#v10).
8. **The forward look**. "But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." [3:13,14](/en/Bible/Philippians/3#v13).
9. **Peace of God**. "Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." [4:6,7](/en/Bible/Philippians/4#v6).
10. **The Christ life**. "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things." [4:3](/en/Bible/Philippians/4#v3).
11. **Contentment**. "I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content." [4:11](/en/Bible/Philippians/4#v11).

13. **Supplying our needs**. "And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus." [4:19](/en/Bible/Philippians/4#v19).
