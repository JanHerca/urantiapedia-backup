## III. Authorship

1. The book was written by John Mark. It is the earliest record of Jesus' life-except for the notes of Andrew.
2. It is really the Gospel according to the teachings of Peter and the oral traditions of the church at Rome.
3. It was completed soon after Peter's death-near the end of A.D. 68.
4. The record has been considerably changed. The latter one-fifth of the original Gospel was lost before the first manuscript was ever copied.
	(The above facts come from the Urantia Book, <a id="s113_46"></a>[UB 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1).)
5. Scholars believe the book was written by Mark sometime between A.D. 64 and 85, perhaps around A.D. 75.

**QUESTION**: How is it that so little of Mark's personal experiences got into this record?

**ANSWER**:
1. Peter had probably prepared some written notes which Mark used.
2. The oral traditions were carefully committed to memory-just like a creed or prayer would be.
3. Since Mark was writing at the request of the church at Rome, he felt under obligation to prepare a statement that would represent Peter's way of telling the story of Jesus and his teachings.
4. He was not writing either a history of Jesus' life or his own biography.

## IV. John Mark in The Urantia Book

1. He first appeared as the "boy of all chores" assigned to the twelve apostles. Urantia Book, <a id="s126_95"></a>[UB 152:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_5).
2. Mark was only partially convinced about Peter's story about walking on the water, so he left part of it out of his record. <a id="s127_126"></a>[UB 152:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p4_4).
3. John Mark spent a whole day alone with Jesus in the hills. <a id="s128_62"></a>[UB 177:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p1_1).
4. John kept a watchful eye on Jesus and the twelve. <a id="s129_53"></a>[UB 182:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p0_1).
5. John watched over Jesus at the olive press, just before his arrest. <a id="s130_71"></a>[UB 183:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_5).
6. John lost his coat to the soldier when he escaped. <a id="s131_54"></a>[UB 183:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_9).
7. John followed the apostles into Galilee after the resurrection. <a id="s132_67"></a>[UB 192:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_4).
8. John recognized Jesus on the shores of Lake Galilee. <a id="s133_56"></a>[UB 192:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_4).
9. John served breakfast to the apostles. <a id="s134_42"></a>[UB 192:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_8).
10. John returned home upon the sudden death of his father, Elijah Mark. <a id="s135_73"></a>[UB 192:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p4_5).
11. John went forth to call the apostles and leading disciples to forgather at his mother's home for the Pentecost meeting. <a id="s136_124"></a>[UB 193:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p6_1).

## V. Mark's Biography in the New Testament

1. John was the son of Mary Mark-a well-to-do Jerusalemite. Acts [12:12-17](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v12).
2. He was a kinsman of Barnabas. Col. [4:10](/en/Bible/Mark/4#v10).
3. He accompanied Barnabas and Paul to Antioch. Acts [12:25](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v25). [13:1](/en/Bible/Mark/13#v1).
4. He was an attendant on the first missionary journey. Acts [13:5](/en/Bible/Mark/13#v5).
5. He deserted the party at Perga. Acts [13:13](/en/Bible/Mark/13#v13).
6. Accordingly, Paul declined to take John on the second trip. Acts [15:38](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v38).
7. This caused trouble between Paul and Barnabas. Acts [15:36-41](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v36).
8. Barnabas took John with him to Cyprus. Acts [15:39](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v39).
9. Later on, Mark seemed to be on good terms with Paul. Col. [4:10](/en/Bible/Mark/4#v10). Philemon v. 24.
10. Mark made good on a visit to the Colossian church, and Paul wanted him to come to Rome. Acts [13:5](/en/Bible/Mark/13#v5).
11. Peter referred to Mark as his son. 1 Peter [5:13](/en/Bible/Mark/5#v13).
12. The anonymous "young man" ([Mark 14:51](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v51)) undoubtedly refers to John Mark.
13. Several early church fathers refer to John as interpreter for Peter.
14. Tradition claims that John Mark was the founder of the church at Alexandria.
15. There was a supposed transfer of Mark's body from Egypt to Venice A.D. 832. His bones are supposed to rest beneath the altar in St. Mark's Church in Venice.

## VI. Antecedents

1. These Gospels are not histories or biographies. They are didactic and apologetic-evangelical writings. They describe a "way of life."
2. Mark seems to have been written for believers-people who were already Christians.
3. Mark sometimes telescoped his stories-one being inserted within the frame-work of another-as in [2:1-12](/en/Bible/Mark/2#v1); [5:21-43](/en/Bible/Mark/5#v21).
4. From a literary standpoint, Mark is the most inferior of all New Testament books. It is poorly organized and unpolished in rhetoric.

## VII. Mark's Theology

1. Mark's theology tends to be Hellenistic-in contrast with Matthew's Jewish theology.
2. Mark's theology is hardly his own-more a blend of Petrine and church of Rome theology.
3. Paul seems to have had little or no influence on Mark's theology. Mark talks about Jesus' "mighty work"-and Paul never once mentions Jesus' miracles.
4. Mark represents an era in which the theology of Christianity is in process of reinterpretation from the Jewish to the gentile.
5. In Mark, Jesus never fully, unequivocally, and unambiguously claimed to be the Messiah.
6. Paul's atonement doctrine "ransom" does appear here and there in Mark.
7. Mark clings to the "mystery" concept of Christian theology-the esoteric idea that the "inner circle" knew special things of which the rank and file of believers were wholly ignorant.
8. All Near East religions had this "mystery" idea-in fact, were known as "mystery cults."
9. The blindness and obtuseness of the Jewish people were not stupidity, but some sort of divine judgment which had overtaken them-like God hardening Pharaoh's heart.
10. There was an early trace of anti-Semitism-or rather, anti-Judaism in Mark's Gospel.
11. When all is said and done, you can't help feeling that Mark really **knows** that Jesus was the Messiah-not the Jewish, but the Christian.
12. Mark is one of the most "precious" books ever written, but it does not give us a full account of Jesus' life.
