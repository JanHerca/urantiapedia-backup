## III. Authorship

1. Matthew was written by Isador, a disciple of Matthew.
2. Isador wrote in Greek, but he had an Aramaic record of the "sayings of Jesus" compiled by Matthew.
3. Isador wrote Matthew in A.D. 71 at Pella. He had Matthew's notes which had been revised in A.D. 40.
4. Isador also had four-fifths of Mark's record.
5. The last copy of Matthew's notes was destroyed in the burning of a Syrian monastery in A.D. 416.
	(The above facts regarding authorship of Matthew are from the Urantia Book, <a id="s103_77"></a>[UB 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1).)
6. Scholars have doubted that Matthew wrote this Gospel because it does not seem that the author was an eyewitness. They believe it was written about A.D. 75 to 80.
7. It is the Jewish viewpoint of Christ's life and work.

## IV. Character

1. In the early times, Matthew was the "best seller" among Christian documents.
2. For several centuries it was the most quoted of the four Gospels.
3. The Roman Catholics like Matthew because it exalts Peter. They have called it the "most important book in the world."
4. Constantly Jesus' work is presented as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy-"that it might be fulfilled," as spoken by the prophet.
5. Matthew is a complete and well organized version of Jesus' life and teaching.
6. Isador took the Sermon on the Mount-Jesus' ordination charge to the twelve-and made it into a "new law and gospel" for the Christian church.
7. Matthew presents the law of the church-deals with divorce and other church regulations.
8. This is the only Gospel that uses the term "church"-two times.
9. It provides for church government and lays down the rules for excommunication of disorderly members.
10. Isador was especially interested in prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
11. Isador goes out of his way to prove that Jesus was truly the Messiah.
12. Isador was at great pains to safeguard the doctrine of Jesus' divinity.
13. Jesus is no longer just a carpenter-but the "son of a carpenter."
14. Isador pays special attention to the genealogy of Jesus-to prove that he was a descendant of David.
15. Isador equates the "church" with the "kingdom of heaven."
16. This Gospel pays little attention to chronology. Many talks of Jesus are brought together as one long sermon.

## V. Framework

1. Matthew is a literary reorganization of Mark's chronological narrative.
2. Isador frequently expands Mark's editorial comments.
3. Matthew is an artistic combination of the topical and the chronological arrangement.
4. Matthew reproduces 90 per cent of Mark's material.
5. Most of the 55 verses of Mark which Matthew omitted were left out for doctrinal reasons.
6. The Matthew gospel is a great literary improvement upon the rather rough style of Mark.
7. In Matthew Jesus pays special attention to the Jews and always is respectful of the "Law of Moses."
8. Some features of Matthew are original-not found in Mark or elsewhere in earlier records:
	- Story of Jesus' birth.
	- Peter walking on the water.
	- The temple tax.
	- Fate of Judas.
	- Dream of Pilate's wife.
	- Pilate's washing of his hands.
	- Earthquake at Jesus' death.
	- Sealing of the tomb.
	- Appearance to women, etc.
9. Isador puts all of Jesus' teachings into five master discourses.
10. The five great discourses might be captioned as follows:
	- A. Sermon on the Mount.
	- B. The Great Evangelistic Charge.
	- C. Parables of the Kingdom.
	- D. Humility and Forgiveness.
	- E. The End of the Age.
11. Matthew tends to group all his work into threes, fives, and sevens.
