## III. Authorship

1. When it comes to the determination of authorship, Joshua is the most difficult and complex of all the books of the Old Testament.
2. J, E, D, and P can all be traced through the book, but D is predominant.
3. The P contributions appear most in the last half of the book.
4. Joshua, a tribal hero of Ephraim, was magnified into the leader of all Israel and author of this book.
5. Joshua is a [Deuteronomic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomist). This same Deuteronomic style runs through Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.
6. It would seem to be the work of one individual, not the production of a group.

## IV. Historical Aspects

1. Joshua takes up the history of Israel on the east bank of the Jordan where Numbers left them.
2. Archaeology has lent much evidence to prove the correctness of Joshua. These excavations are at Jericho, Bethel, Lachish, and Debir.
3. According to Joshua, the Israelites cross the Jordan, take Jericho, and then cut a swath right through the middle of Palestine. Then they subdue the south and then the north.
4. But, in other places, the record confirms the fact that this conquest was not complete. Jerusalem was not conquered until the times of David. (See [Judges 1](/en/Bible/Judges/1).)
5. Excavations show that many Canaanite cities suffered two or even three total destructions.

## V. The Religious Message

1. From a religious standpoint, Joshua represents the story of God's dealings with his people.
2. The authors use the medium of history to hammer home their points.
3. When we face the religious aspects of Joshua our problem is: How can you reconcile Yahweh's holy wars-injunction to destroy all men, women, and children-with the ethical teachings of the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ?
4. Yahweh claims dedicated obedience, because of the following:
	- A. His covenant with Abraham.
	- B. He delivered them from Egyptian slavery.
	- C. He led them into the promised land.
5. The New Testament analogue is found in 1 Peter I:4. "An inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading."

(This book formed a part of a greater whole which embraced the Deuteronomic narratives extending from the times of the conquest to the kingdom.)
