## I. Outline

1. Moab. [1:1-18](/en/Bible/Ruth/1#v1).
2. Bethlehem. [1:19-22](/en/Bible/Ruth/1#v19).
3. Harvest Field. [2:1-23](/en/Bible/Ruth/2#v1).
4. Threshing Floor. [3:1-18](/en/Bible/Ruth/3#v1).
5. The Gate. [4:1-12](/en/Bible/Ruth/4#v1).
6. Conclusion. [4:13-22](/en/Bible/Ruth/4#v13).

## II. Authorship

1. Author unknown. Probably some liberal-minded Jew of the post-exilic period.
2. In the Hebrew canon it was placed among the "writings"-along with Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, and Esther.
3. Probably written sometime in the 5th Century B.C.

## III. The Purpose

1. Probably included in the Jewish canon of sacred scriptures because- the grandson of Ruth's child was David, king of Israel.
2. The main purpose of this story is to counteract the attitude of Ezra and Nehemiah against mixed marriages.
3. It is the ideal "short story." It is a "friendship" story; there is no villain.
4. It is a rare story of friendship between two women-like that of David and Jonathan, among men.
5. It counteracts the popular notion of difficulty in getting along with mothers-in-law.
6. It is a story of irresistible charm.
7. The heroine is brave, determined, loyal, and sagacious.
8. The book exemplifies the teaching of Paul: "There is neither Jew nor Greek." [Gal. 3:28](/en/Bible/Galatians/3#v28).

## IV. The Story of Ruth

1. Ruth forsakes her people to go with Naomi, who has lost her husband and two sons.
2. Naomi is welcomed at Bethlehem.
3. Ruth joins the gleaners to get food.
4. Naomi sends Ruth to Boaz by night.
5. The marriage-and Naomi adopts the child.

## V. Selected Texts

**Ruth and Naomi**. "But Ruth said...'Where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.'" [1:16](/en/Bible/Ruth/1#v16).
