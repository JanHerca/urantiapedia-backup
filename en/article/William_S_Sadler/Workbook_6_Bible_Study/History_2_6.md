From the Death of Solomon to Mid-eighth Century

## I. First Fifty Years Of The Divided Monarchy

922 - 876 B.C.
1. The division of the kingdom meant the collapse of empire.
2. Both Ammon and Moab set up shop for themselves.
3. Israel and Judah have become second-rate states.
4. The schism was followed by two generations of sporadic warfare, and all this to no conclusion.
5. The first generation:
	- a. Rehoboam of Judah, 922-915.
	- b. Jeroboam of Israel, 922-901.
6. The Egyptian Shishak invaded Judah—struck with enormous force. Rehoboam paid large tribute.
7. Trouble in Egypt caused Shishak to withdraw.
8. The rival states had internal troubles and kept up their petty warfare.
9. Jeroboam established a new cult to rival that of Jerusalem. He set up shrines at Bethel and Dan.
10. On the death of Jeroboam pandemonium reigned. His son Nadab was assassinated by Baasha. His son Elah was assassinated by Zimri.
11. Zimri took his life when Omri took the throne. It required several years for Omri to establish himself.
12. The internal affairs of Judah were a bit more tranquil. Paganism started by Solomon made more progress.
13. Remember: Rehoboam was Solomon’s son by Naamah, an Ammonite princess.

## II. From Omri To Jehu

876 - 842 B.C.
1. The house of Omri brings stability to Israel. He settles things internally and makes peace with his neighbors.
2. Omri’s reign was short but he was internationally respected—making alliances with many powers.
3. His son Ahab married the daughter of the king of Tyre—Jezebel. Ahab’s sister (or daughter) married Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
4. For a time, Israel and Judah stop their feuding—and present a united front to the world.
5. Omri made an alliance with Ben-hadad of Damascus, but Ahab had to fight these Arameans several times.
6. There was material prosperity. But all was not well—the poor got poorer and the rich got richer.
7. Jezebel brought on a religious crisis. She built a temple for Melquart Asherah. But Jezebel was an aggressive pagan missionary.
8. Prophets of Baal and Asherah enjoyed official status. I Kings 18:19.
9. Elijah began his battle with Jezebel and the prophets of Baal. Though Ahab and Jezebel held on for a time they finally fell.
10. Ahaziah (850-849) and Jehoram (849-842) followed after the fall of Ahab. Trouble in Damascus and Moab destroyed all peace.
11. Elisha makes trouble for the “House of Omri.” There was a great revival of Yahwehism.
12. The Rechabites (Kenites) were internal trouble-makers. They followed Nazarite practices.
13. Now came the blood purge of Jehu—842. II Kings 9,10. Jehu entered Jezreel and threw Jezebel out the window. The cult of Baal was destroyed.
14. Things in Judah improved under Jehoshaphat (873-849). He established many reforms. II Chron 19:4-11.
15. Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram was a Yahwehist—but his queen, Athaliah, was a Baalist. She induced him to kill all his brothers—to exterminate the Omri family.

## III. Israel And Judah

From Mid-ninth to Mid-eighth Century
1. Though Jehr founded a dynasty lasting for a century, it was one long reign of weakness.
2. Damascus began to encroach upon Israel. They dominated the country and only refrained from invading Judah by receiving a large tribute.
3. Joash and Judah (837-800). Enthroned as a child. (Jehoiada, the chief priest, probably acted as regent.) He was very unpopular—was assassinated and succeeded by his son Amaziah.
4. Things in Israel improved under Jeroboam II (786-746) and Uzziah (783-742). One of the bright and prosperous eras of Israel.
5. But Israel got sick again. Amos and Hosea combat social disintegration. Morals are at a low ebb.
6. Paganism is taking over. The prophets protest in vain. Nevertheless, this is the dawn of the new age of the classic prophets of all Israel.
