## II. Timothy ahd Titus

1. Timothy, son of a Greek father and Jewish mother, was probably converted under Paul at Lystra.
2. Timothy carried out many missions to the churches for Paul. He joined Paul at Rome, then went to Ephesus.
3. We know but little of the gentile Titus. Later he became Bishop of Crete.
4. Timothy was Paul's "beloved child." [2 Tim. 1:2](/en/Bible/2_Timothy/1#v2).

## III. Background and Purpose

1. These letters present a picture of a highly complex ecclesiastical church organization.
2. They are concerned with the work of church officials and all orders of church administrators.
3. Apostles and prophets have been succeeded by bishops and archbishops.
4. Worship must be regulated. Heresy must be resisted. Discipline must be maintained.
5. Worship must be supervised-ministers regulated and supported.
6. These letters deal with "proud, arrogant, and abusive men," "deceitful spirits and doctrine of demons," "imposters and deceivers."
7. Theology is recognized-"workmen...rightly dividing the word of truth."
8. The purpose of preaching is practical-not speculative.
9. Ministers are to be "good soldiers of Jesus Christ." Says Paul; "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith." [4:7](/en/Bible/2_Timothy/4#v7).
10. Activities of women in the church are greatly restricted.
11. Eighteen characteristics of the false teacher. [2 Tim. 3:2-5](/en/Bible/2_Timothy/3#v2).
12. The epistles denounce the "craving for controversy and for disputes about words," "Godless chatter."
13. The church is contending with two types of heresy:
	- A. Jewish doctrines.
	- B. Hellenic heresy.
14. These epistles are combating:
	- A. Jewish teaching-"the circumcision party."
	- B. Magic-Eastern charms and hypnotism.
	- C. Asceticism-Essene errors.
	- D. Hellenism and Gnostic teachings.
	- E. Harcion and his heresy.
	- F. Docetism-rejection of the second advent.

## IV. Language And Style

1. These epistles use hundreds of words not found in Paul's other letters; 175 not found in all of the New Testament.
2. The word "doctrine" occurs 15 times in these pastorals-6 times in all the rest of the New Testament.
3. The vocabulary of these epistles is more like that of the early Christian writers than Paul.
4. There are some passages in these letters that are undoubtedly Pauline- but on the whole the language is foreign to Paul.
5. There is much non-Pauline theology and church organization in these epistles.
6. Paul was a "mystic"-the author of the pastorals is an "ecclesiastic."
7. These pastorals are decidedly more. Jewish than Paul's writings.
8. Attitude towards marriage, wine, and society is largely Jewish.
9. Paul's free "spirit" leadership has become a ritual of "laying on of hands."
10. Paul's "faith" in these pastorals becomes the "creed."
11. These are the only books of the New Testament addressed to **individuals**\- ministers.
12. These letters sound like those of Ignatius and Polycarp written from A.D. 110 to 117.

## V. Place and Date

1. These letters have been dated all the way from A.D. 61 to 180, but were probably written between 110 and 140.
2. The unknown author of these epistles has Paul write from prison, and does his best to make it appear that Paul really wrote these letters to Timothy and Titus.
3. It seems likely that these three epistles were based on fragments of messages to Timothy and Titus, but fifty years later were rewritten by an admirer and follower of Paul.

23. **The last days**. "In the last days there will come times of stress. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, fierce, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding the form of religion but denying the power of it.
