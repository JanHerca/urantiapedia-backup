## III. Authorship

1. The author of this piece of Semitic history fiction is unknown.
2. The book was written to justify the two-day feast of Purim, which had long been celebrated by the Jews.
3. There are implications that the author was a Persian Jew.
4. The author seems to have had a cynical attitude toward religion. He depended on political intrigue.
5. The author was a skillful literary artist. Esther is regarded as a masterpiece of literature.
6. Perhaps written during the third century B.C. or possibly as late as 125 B.C.

## IV. Purpose

1. Purim had no basis in the law. As a holiday it was probably picked up from another nation, much as modern Jews, in a secular way, celebrate Christmas.
2. The book of Esther supplies the reason for the continued celebration of the Purim festival.
3. Purim was a convivial and secular celebration and it needed some sort of racial or religious background for its justification. It was the only worldly holiday in the Jewish calendar.
4. To sum up: The book was to propagandize and justify Purim.

## V. Historicity

1. Herodotus, the Greek historian, makes no mention of Xerxes having either Vashti or Esther as queen.
2. Most scholars regard the book as romance fiction-designed to tickle Jewish fancy and exalt the national ego.
3. In other words, Esther should be classed as a historical novel.
4. There were objections to the book's being received into the sacred canon, there being no mention of God, prayer, or any other religious practice.
5. The ethics and morals of the book are in every way contrary to the teachings of the Old Testament prophets and the teachings of Christianity.

## VI. Some General Considerations

1. The little book is shot through with exaggerations: high gallows, six months' feast, year's beauty treatment for court maidens, 10,000 talents ($18,000,000) for financing the pogrom.
2. The book exhibits gross Jewish intolerance-75,510 gentiles were slaughtered in a single day.
3. Part of the original book of Esther was so distasteful that it was removed and put in the Apocrypha.
4. Neither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever quotes from, or refers to the book of Esther.
5. The heroine of the book violates Jewish prohibition of marriage with the uncircumcised gentiles.
6. Esther was not accepted for the Old Testament canon until A.D.397 at the Council of Carthage.
7. The book of Esther may have something to do with creating and perpetuating the historic cleavage between historic Judaism and prophetic Christianity.
8. Esther is certainly contrary to the teaching of both the Second Isaiah and Jesus of Nazareth.
9. Esther became popular among the Jews because Purim was always a popular and festive holiday.
