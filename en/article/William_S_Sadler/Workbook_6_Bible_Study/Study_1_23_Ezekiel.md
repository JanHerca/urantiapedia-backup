## III. Authorship

1. Ezekiel was author of the original book. But the book was subjected to a thorough job of rewriting by a later editor.
2. The editorial work was so extensive as to almost make this editor a coauthor.
3. The editor greatly amplified the reasons for the captivity: idolatry, lewdness, false prophets, Sabbath-breaking, immorality, social sins, etc.
4. The editor may have also been a priest.
5. The editor made use of more than fifty characteristic words or phrases in his work. The phrase "Then they will know that I am the Lord" he uses 56 times.
6. Date: Generally accepted - 593-571 B.C.

## IV. Ezekiel Himself

1. The author was familiar with the temple and had heard the preaching of Jeremiah.
2. His book covers 22 years of his life.
3. He was taken to Babylon along with King Jehoiachin.
4. He lived in a colony of exiles at Tel Abib on the Chebar, a canal of the Euphrates irrigation system.
5. He was married and had a house of his own. His great tragedy was the loss of his wife.
6. In trying to solve his problems, Ezekiel failed to make adjustment to reality; he retreated into a dream world of his own fantasy.
7. It would seem that he finally resolved his conflicts on the higher level of religious adjustment and became a prophet.
8. He had visions and was addicted to allegories.
9. He contributed much to the doctrine of angelology among the Hebrews.
10. It is strange that neither Jeremiah nor Ezekiel ever mentions the other. The same is true of Amos and Hosea.
11. From [3:25,26](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/3#v25), [4:4](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/4#v4), [24:27](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/24#v27), and [33:22](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/33#v22) we may conclude that his ailment was catatonic schizophrenia.
12. You recall that King Saul was afflicted with manic-depressive psychosis. Now we have Ezekiel with schizophrenia.

## V. Chapters 40-48

1. It is doubtful if Ezekiel wrote these chapters. The concept of a "new age" belongs to the editor rather than Ezekiel.
2. The new Jerusalem and new ideas about inner religious experience also belong to the editor.
3. Ezekiel was more pessimistic than the editor.
4. The book of Ezekiel is replete with new ideas and concepts. And this all suggests that numerous writers and editors contributed to the book as we now have it.

## VI. Ezekiel's Message

1. Like Isaiah, he protested against foreign alliances.
2. He is the outstanding prophet teaching about angels.
3. Yahweh had as wives two sisters; one consorted with the Assyrians and was punished; the other with the Egyptians and was likewise destroyed.
4. He was the prophet of allegories-winds, fire, wheels within wheels, etc.
5. He introduced the idea of God as a shepherd, which Jesus used so effectively.
6. He talked about "individual religious experience"-"God's law written on the tablets of the heart."
7. Individual responsibility for sin- "Whoso sinneth, he shall die." He denounced concept of fathers' eating sour grapes and the children's teeth being set on edge.
8. Ezekiel tried to reform the Jewish ritual. Not so much against ceremonies as was Jeremiah.
9. He uttered curses against Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Sidon, and Egypt.
10. He presented a universal God, but not a universal religion-Yahweh and Israel belonged together.
11. It would seem that the allegories of Ezekiel had considerable influence on the author of Revelation-the river of life, foursquare city, etc.
