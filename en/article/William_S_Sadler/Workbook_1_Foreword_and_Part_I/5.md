**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p0_1) — “If the infinite mind...”

**COMMENT**

1. In the Adjusters God fraternizes with man. A fragment of God resides in man.
	- A. **Fraternize**: “To associate or hold fellowship with as brothers or upon comradely terms; to have brotherly feelings.”
	- B. **Reside**: “To have an abiding place; to be present as an element; inhere as a quality; to be vested as a right—chiefly within.”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p0_2) — “God has distributed...”

**COMMENT**

1. The infinity of God exists in his six absolutes—but he makes personal contact with us by means of his prepersonal spirit.
2. He also bestows personality upon us.
3. And then all of this is maintained by means of his personality circuit.
4. The six absolute co-ordinates:
	- A. The Eternal Son.
	- B. The Infinite Spirit.

### VII. UB 5:1.7 — “Man is spiritually indwelt...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_7) — “Man is spiritually indwelt...”

**COMMENT**

1. Our Adjusters are certain of survival.
2. If the soul is dedicated to doing the Father’s will, there is no power in the cosmos that can prevent such a soul from ascending to Paradise.

	- C. Time of irrevocable choice. Thought Adjuster fusion.
	- D. The case of Lucifer.
2. Man’s doom is sealed only when he has lost the power to choose.
3. God never closes his heart. It is man who closes his heart to all divine influences.
4. Man is lost only when he refuses to do the will of God.
	- A. God-consciousness—to know God.
	- B. God-oneness—righteousness.
		(1) Divinity of character.
		(2) Bearing fruits of the spirit.
		(3) Oneness with the Adjuster.
5. Adjuster fusion assures man’s eternal destiny. The decision is irrevocable.
	**Note**: The status of “irrevocable choice” pertains to the status of salvation as well as to that of destruction. That is:
		- A. Lucifer can’t (won’t) repent.
		- B. An Adjuster-fused mortal can’t (won’t) sin.

	**Note**: The difference between selfhood and personality. The Thought Adjuster is not a part of the Father’s personality, but **is** a part of his self. The Adjuster has individuality—selfhood—but not personality.
2. God has embarked on the eternal adventure with us.
3. If we yield to our spirit helpers we cannot fail to attain our Paradise destiny.
4. The secret of salvation is “yielding to spirit leadings.”
	- A. The spirit _leads_—does not drive or compel—free will choosing.
	- B. Having yielded—you cannot fail.
	- C. Survival—if you want it—is sure, certain, and **simple**.
	- D. It would be easy if it were not for the doubts born of fear.

## 2. THE PRESENCE OF GOD

### I. UB 5:2.1 — “The physical presence...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_1) — “The physical presence...”

**COMMENT**

1. The physical presence of God is the reality of the material cosmos. **Note**: God has a physical presence as well as a mind, spirit, personality, and selfhood (Adjuster) presence.
2. Deity mind presence is determined by depth of mentality and the personality level.
3. Spiritual presence is determined by spiritual capacity of receptivity and dedication to the Father’s will.
4. Spirituality depends on two conditions:
	- A. Actual capacity of spirit receptivity. Factual and literal. Dependence on antecedents.
	- B. Consecration of creature will—free will on the spiritual level—to doing the Father’s will. Definitions:
		(1) **CONSECRATE**: To dedicate—to devote to some purpose.
		(2) **DEDICATE**: To devote exclusively to the service of worship of a divine being.

### II. UB 5:2.2 — “God lives in...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_2) — “God lives in...”

**COMMENT**

1. God lives in everyone of his spirit-born sons.
2. The Paradise Sons always have access to the “right hand of the Father.”
3. Let us make a study of the “right hand of God” in the Bible:
	Moses in his farewell address said: **[Deut 33:2](/en/Bible/Deuteronomy/33#v2)**. “‘The Lord came from Sinai...with flaming fire at his right hand.’”
	**Symbol of Authority**. **[Ps 20:6](/en/Bible/Psalms/20#v6)**. “I know that the Lord will help his anointed...with mighty victories by his right hand.”
	**Symbol of Power**. **[Ps 63:8](/en/Bible/Psalms/63#v8)**. “My soul clings to thee; thy right hand upholds me.”
	**Symbol of Security**. **[Isa 62:8](/en/Bible/Isaiah/62#v8)**. “The Lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm.”
	**Symbol of Dependable Force**. **[Matt 26:64](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v64)**. “‘Hereafter you shall see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power.” **Note**: This is the associated power of God the Father and God the Creator Son.
	**Symbol of Sovereignty**. **[Mark 16:19](/en/Bible/Mark/16#v19)**. “So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.”
	Peter, in discoursing on this elevation of Jesus, said: **[Acts 2:33](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v33)**. “Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God.”
	Paul envisaged Jesus as remaining at the Father’s right hand—probably until his second coming. See **[Rom 8:34](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v34)**. “It is Christ Jesus...who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.”
	That Paul conceived the “right hand of God” as symbolic of universe sovereignty is shown in **[Eph 1:20-22](/en/Bible/Ephesians/1#v20)**. “When he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things.”
	After all, Paul understood the **real** purpose of the bestowal. The theological twisting of the atonement doctrine was a compromise attempt to convert the Jews.
	Other texts which show the belief that Jesus is **now** sitting at the “right hand of God” are:
	**[Col 3:1](/en/Bible/Colossians/3#v1)**. “If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.”
	**[Heb 12:2](/en/Bible/Hebrews/12#v2)**. “Looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.”
	**Note**: In Pauline philosophy the right hand of God is Salvington, headquarters of the local universe of Nebadon.
**Note**: It is the practice to raise the right hand in taking an oath.
4. “The bosom of the Father” refers to the personality circuit of God—no matter where communion may take place.

### III. UB 5:2.3 — “The divine presence...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_3) — “The divine presence...”

**COMMENT**

1. The divine presence is best realized in communion with the Adjuster.
2. Dream not of God far off in the skies when he lives within you.

### IV. UB 5:2.4 — “It is because...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_4) — “It is because...”

**COMMENT**

1. Adjusters assist us in making use of all spiritual influences which surround us.
2. Being more or less unconscious of the presence of the Adjuster does not disprove his reality.
3. Exceptional spiritual experience may occur at such a high level in the superconscious as to be wholly beyond conscious awareness, just as many human experiences transpire so deep in the subconscious as to elude all conscious recognition by the thinking levels of the mind.
4. Proof of fraternity with the Adjuster consists in “the fruits of the spirit.” **[Matt 7:20](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v20)**. “Thus you will know them by their fruits.”

## DISCUSSION OF FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT

1. **[Luke 6:44](/en/Bible/Luke/6#v44)**. “Each tree is known by its own fruit.”
2. “The fruits of the spirit are the substance of the Supreme as he is realizable in human experience.”[UB 117:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_17)
3. “The fruits of the spirit, your sincere and loving service, are the mighty social lever to uplift the races of darkness, and this Spirit of Truth will become your power-multiplying fulcrum.”[UB 178:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_6)

7. In _The Urantia Book_[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2)

### V. UB 5:2.5 — “It is exceedingly difficult...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_5) — “It is exceedingly difficult...”

**COMMENT**

1. It is difficult for the material mind to become conscious of the activities of divine entities like the Adjusters.
2. Increased spirituality enhances the recognition of the spiritual activities of the indwelling Monitors.

### VI. UB 5:2.6 — “The entire experience...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p2_6) — “The entire experience...”

**COMMENT**

1. The experience of Adjuster communion involves:
	- A. Mortal status.
	- B. Motivation.
	- C. Spiritual experience.
2. Such an attitude is not merely:
	- A. Mild moral inclination.
	- B. Intellectual wishfulness.
	- C. Spiritual ecstasy.
3. The realization of the Adjuster is largely a matter of soul consciousness.
4. The proofs of all this inner experience are “the fruits of the spirit.”

## 3. TRUE WORSHIP

### I. UB 5:3.1 — “Though the Paradise Deities...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_1) — “Though the Paradise Deities...”

**COMMENT**

1. There is a difference between the Deities in such matters as prayer, communion, and worship.
2. In the last analysis, we worship the Universal Father—and him only.
3. True, we do also worship the Father as revealed in his Creator Sons.

### II. UB 5:3.2 — “Supplications of all kinds...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_2) — “Supplications of all kinds...”

**COMMENT**

1. Supplications belong to the realm of the Eternal Son.
2. Prayers (not adoration and worship) belong to the local universe—to the realm of the Creator Son.
3. What is the difference between supplication and prayer?
	- A. **Supplication**. Act of humble and earnest entreaty. Prayer for mercy, aid, or some blessing. To implore God, Beseech, petition, importune, solicit, crave, beg.
	- B. **Prayer**. An earnest request to someone for something. An entreaty. The act of addressing Divinity. A petition to God.
4. There seem to be three levels concerned in this discussion.
	- A. **Supplication**: The lower levels of conscious and formal communion with Deity. The less articulate and more spontaneous expression of creature dependence upon the Creator. The more **emotional** type of Deity address.
	- B. **Prayer**: The higher level of Deity communication. The more **intellectual** and better formulated appeal of man to God. A group could hardly supplicate, but they could agree on a prayer.
	- C. **Worship**: The highest type of Deity communion. The more **spiritual** type of address to God. May have both emotional and intellectual content, but is predominately spiritual. Worship seeks and asks nothing specific for the worshipper.
5. Worship is recognized by the Adjuster and dispatched to the Father over his personality circuit.
	**Question**: How does a prepersonal entity function on a personality circuit? The Adjuster must be acting as vicegerent of the human personality.
6. Other word meanings:
	- A. **Homage**. Solemn public ceremony by which a man acknowledges that he is the man of a lord, and promises faith and support in return for his lord’s protection.
	- B. **Worship**. Act of paying divine honors to Deity. The adoration or reverence paid to God. To adore, to venerate, to revere.
7. So all types of Father fragments are able to register the adoration of their subjects in the presence of the Universal Father.
8. Adjusters may also make use of prepersonal channels and the spirit gravity circuit of the Eternal Son.
	**Question**: What are prepersonal channels of communication? Probably the omnipresence of God.

### III. UB 5:3.3 — “Worship is for...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_3) — “Worship is for...”

**COMMENT**

1. Worship is for its own sake; prayer embodies a self- or creature-interest.
2. We worship God for what we comprehend him to be.
3. Worship asks nothing and expects nothing for the worshipper.
4. We freely worship God because of his lovable nature and adorable attributes.

### IV. UB 5:3.4 — “The moment the element...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_4) — “The moment the element...”

**COMMENT**

1. When self-interest intrudes—that moment worship translates to prayer.
2. But it is proper to address prayer to the Father as a part of true worship.

### V. UB 5:3.5 — “When you deal...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_5) — “When you deal...”

**COMMENT**

1. In our daily living we are dealing with the personalities of the Infinite Spirit.
2. Worship the Father. Pray to the Sons. Work out the details of living with the children of the Infinite Spirit.

### VI. UB 5:3.6 — “The Creator or Sovereign Sons...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_6) — “The Creator or Sovereign Sons...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Creator Son of the local universe stands in the place of both the Universal Father and the Eternal Son.
2. These Creator Sons give ear to both the worship of the Father and the supplications of their universe children.
3. To local universe citizens, the Creator Son is, to all practical purposes, God.
4. The Infinite Spirit keeps in touch with the children of a local universe through the Creative Mother Spirit.

### VII. UB 5:3.7 — “Sincere worship connotes...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_7) — “Sincere worship connotes...”

**COMMENT**

1. Worship connotes all powers of personality functioning under the dominance of the soul and directionized by the Adjuster.
2. Mortal mind can never become highly conscious of the reality of worship.
3. It is the evolving soul that is able to realize the reality of worship.
4. Soul growth occurs independently of self-consciousness.

### VIII. UB 5:3.8 — “The worship experience...”

**REFERENCE**: [UB 5:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_8) — “The worship experience...”

**COMMENT**

1. In worship, the Adjuster is attempting to express the aspirations of the human soul.
2. There must be two phases of worship:
	- A. The conscious—the spiritual upreach of man’s mind.
	- B. The superconscious—the attempt of the Adjuster to tell God about the status and attitude of the evolving soul.
3. There are three phases of the relation of man to his Maker:
	- A. Supplication—his emotional expression.
	- B. Prayer—the intellectual life.
	- C. Worship—expression of the soul. Spiritual. (Morontial?)
4. Considering all, no wonder worship is largely unconscious.
5. Note that the evolving soul experiences “inexpressible longings and unutterable aspirations.” (See [Rom 8:26](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v26))
6. The Adjuster may not always succeed in his efforts—but he does **attempt**.
7. Worship is the act of the mind assenting to the attempt of the soul under the guidance of the Adjuster to communicate with the Universal Father as a faith son.
8. Note the steps in worship:
	- A. The material conscious mind _acts_.
	- B. This **act** of mind—not thought, wish, or longing—consists in _assenting_ to something.
	- C. This something is: The attempt of the _soul_ (its spiritualizing self) to communicate with God.
	- D. This soul thus communicates as “a faith son” of the Universal Father.
	- E. The mind assents to this adventure with the understanding that the whole transaction will be carried out “under the guidance” of the Adjuster—the “associated spirit.”
9. Thus the technique of worship is performed by means of the following:
	- A. The mortal mind consents to worship.
	- B. The immortal soul craves worship.
	- C. The divine Adjuster conducts this worship.
	- D. All this is in behalf of the mortal mind and the evolving immortal soul.
10. True worship, in the last analysis, becomes an experience realized on four cosmic levels:
	- A. The intellectual.
	- B. The morontial.
	- C. The spiritual.
	- D. The personal.
11. And all of this embraces the consciousness of mind, soul, and spirit—and their unification in and as _personality_.
