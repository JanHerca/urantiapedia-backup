## INTRODUCTION

### I. UB 16:0.1 — “The Seven Master Spirits...”

**REFERENCE:**<a id="s30_14"></a>[UB 16:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_1) — “The Seven Master Spirits...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Seven Master Spirits are the primal agents of the Infinite Spirit.
2. The Seven Master Spirits represent all possible associations and interassociations of the three Deities.
3. This explains why the inhabited universe exists and is administered in seven grand divisions.

The Seven Master Spirits derive their individual characteristics from these seven likenesses:
	1. The Universal Father.
	2. The Eternal Son.
	3. The Infinite Spirit.
	4. The Father and the Son.
	5. The Father and the Spirit.
	6. The Son and the Spirit.
	7. The Father, Son, and Spirit.

Father and Son are both ancestors of the Master Spirits, in addition to the Infinite Spirit. The diversity of the Master Spirits is manifested throughout all creation. Each Master Spirits maintains force-focal headquarters on the periphery of Paradise.

## 1. RELATION TO TRIUNE DEITY

### I. UB 16:1.1, last sentence — “We have come to speak...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s53_15"></a>[UB 16:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_1), last sentence — “We have come to speak...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Trinity is the absolute inevitability.
2. The Seven Master Spirits are the subabsolute inevitability.

### II. UB 16:1.3 — “But when the Seven...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s62_15"></a>[UB 16:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_3) — “But when the Seven...”

**COMMENT**

When the Seven Master Spirits assemble and function as a group, they are representative of the power, wisdom, and authority of the Trinity. Master Spirits portray sevenfold Deity.

## 2. RELATION TO THE INFINITE SPIRIT

### I. UB 16:2.1, 2nd sentence — “At the center of centers...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s72_15"></a>[UB 16:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_1), 2nd sentence — “At the center of centers...”

**COMMENT**

1. Not all who attain Paradise are able immediately to discern the Infinite Spirit.
2. But all are able to commune with the Master Spirit who presides over the superuniverse of their origin.

### II. UB 16:2.2 — “To the universe...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s81_15"></a>[UB 16:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_2) — “To the universe...”

**COMMENT**

Outside of Paradise and Havona, the Infinite Spirit speaks only by and through the Seven Master Spirits.
Outside Havona, the Infinite Spirit works through the Master Spirits. Collectively they mainfest attributes of the Infinite Spirit.

## 3. IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY OF THE MASTER SPIRITS

### I. UB 16:3.1 — “The Seven Master Spirits...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s92_15"></a>[UB 16:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_1) — “The Seven Master Spirits...”

**COMMENT**

1. Master Spirits are personal and indescribable. They are akin, but also diverse.
2. Each conducts his superuniverse in accordance with his unique nature.

### II. UB 16:3.19 — “The inability of the Havona...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s101_15"></a>[UB 16:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_19) — “The inability of the Havona...”

**COMMENT**

1. During this age, the Seventh Master Spirit compensates the inability of Havona pilgrims to find God the Supreme.
2. All ascenders will be able to recognize and communicate with Master Spirit Number Seven.
Detailed description of the nature and function of the Seven Master Spirits as representing the seven associations of Deity, and as related to the seven superuniverses. When all Seven Master Spirits are associated they are representative of the Trinity. The Seventh Master Spirit acts for the evolving God the Supreme and is also in liaison with the Reflective Spirits of Uversa.

## DISCUSSION

John saw seven spirits. See **[Rev 1:4](/en/Bible/Revelation/1#v4)**. “And from the seven spirits who are before his throne.”

This passage probably refers to the seven Image Aids on Uversa.

See also **[Rev 2:7](/en/Bible/Revelation/2#v7)**. “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”

One of these spirits says: “To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” **[Rev 2:7](/en/Bible/Revelation/2#v7)**.

## 4. ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE MASTER SPIRITS

## I. UB 16:4.1, last sentence — “It is literally true...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s123_15"></a>[UB 16:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p14_1), last sentence — “It is literally true...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Seven Master Spirits are:
	- A. Personalized physical power.
	- B. Cosmic mind.
	- C. Spiritual presence of triune Deity.
2. This seems to be **[Rev 5:6](/en/Bible/Revelation/5#v6)**. “Which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.”

### II. UB 16:4.3 — “The Seven Master Spirits are the creators...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s135_15"></a>[UB 16:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p4_3) — “The Seven Master Spirits are the creators...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Master Spirits are the creators of the Universe Power Directors and their associates.
2. They also assist the Creator Sons in the organization of local universes.

### III. UB 16:4.6 — “Much of the reality...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s144_15"></a>[UB 16:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p4_6) — “Much of the reality...”

**COMMENT**

1. Always does the morontia intervene between the material and spirit realms.
2. It is in the morontia that the Master Spirits contribute so much to man’s ascension experience.

The Master Spirits represent the Third Source and Center in all relationships of energy, mind, and spirit. They function on all universe levels below the absolute. They are creators of the cosmic mind and the Universe Power Directors. Cannot connect energy manifestations of the Master Spirits with force functions of the Unqualified Absolute.

Relation to Morontia Power Supervisors is unrevealed.

The seven spheres of functional activity.

## 5. RELATION TO CREATURES

### I. UB 16:5.2 — “Through this personal influence...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s161_15"></a>[UB 16:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p5_2) — “Through this personal influence...”

**COMMENT**

1. Every ascendant mortal bears the characteristic stamp of one of the Master Spirits.
2. Each creature, man or angel, will eternally carry this badge of natal identification.

### II. UB 16:5.5, last 2 sentences — “Throughout all eternity...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s170_15"></a>[UB 16:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p5_5), last 2 sentences — “Throughout all eternity...”

**COMMENT**

1. Even in the Corps of the Finality these Master Spirit traits are in evidence.
2. To portray a complete Trinity relationship requires seven finaliters—one from each superuniverse.

A superuniverse has the counsel of all Seven Master Spirits—but the personal touch of only one. The personal stamp of the Master Spirit persists eternally.

## 6. THE COSMIC MIND

### I. UB 16:6.1 — “The Master Spirits are the sevenfold...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s183_15"></a>[UB 16:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_1) — “The Master Spirits are the sevenfold...”

**COMMENT**

1. The Master Spirits are the source of the cosmic mind.
2. The cosmic mind is a subabsolute derivation from the Infinite Spirit.
3. Cosmic mind is functionally related to the mind of the Supreme Being.

### II. UB 16:6.4 — “There exists in all...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s193_15"></a>[UB 16:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_4) — “There exists in all...”

**COMMENT**

1. The “reality response” is a quality of cosmic mind which saves us from the false assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion.
2. This reality sensitivity responds to cosmic reality just as energy material responds to gravity.

### III. UB 16:6.5 — “The cosmic mind...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s202_15"></a>[UB 16:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_5) — “The cosmic mind...”

**COMMENT**

The cosmic mind unfailingly responds to three levels of reality:
1. Causation—mathematical response.
2. Duty—judicial response.
3. Worship—spiritual response.

### IV. UB 16:6.11 — “It is the purpose of education...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s213_15"></a>[UB 16:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_11) — “It is the purpose of education...”

**COMMENT**

It is the purpose of:
1. **Education**—to develop and sharpen these endowments.
2. **Civilization**—to express them.
3. **Life Experience**—to realize them.
4. **Religion**—to ennoble them.
5. **Personality**—to unify them.

On evolutionary worlds Master Spirits work through local universe Mother Spirits. Creature kinship is explained by the common cosmic mind. The levels of reality (causation, duty, worship) pertain to science, philosophy, and religion. This represents man’s experience with things, meanings, and values.

## 6. MORALS, VIRTUE, AND PERSONALITY

### I. UB 16:7.3 — “Only a personality...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s230_15"></a>[UB 16:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_3) — “Only a personality...”

**COMMENT**

1. Personality has insight and foresight—can look before it leaps.
2. Personality can learn from looking as well as from leaping.
3. Animals can learn only by leaping.

### II. UB 16:7.9 — “Morality can never be...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s240_15"></a>[UB 16:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_9) — “Morality can never be...”

**COMMENT**

1. Morality cannot be advanced by force.
2. Moral fragrance is contagious. Right-minded persons will be attracted.

Moral duty, scientific curiosity, and spiritual insight are human inalienables. Animal response is on motor level of experience with trial and error. Moral beings can choose between ends as well as between means. Virtue is choosing between good and evil. Choice is affected by ignorance and immaturity. Supreme virtue is to do the will of the Father.

## 8. URANTIA PERSONALITY

### I. UB 16:8.3 — “Personality is a unique...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s253_15"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3) — “Personality is a unique...”

**COMMENT**

1. Personality is unique and always precedes the coming of the Thought Adjuster.
2. Personality is diverse, original, and exclusive; Thought Adjusters are identical in nature.
3. Personality may be qualified by the nature of the material, mindal, or spiritual qualities of the organismal vehicle.

### II. UB 16:8.5 — “Creature personality is...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s263_15"></a>[UB 16:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_5) — “Creature personality is...”

**COMMENT**

Personality is distinguished by:
1. Self-consciousness.
2. Relative free will.

### III. UB 16:8.7 — “The relative free will...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s273_15"></a>[UB 16:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_7) — “The relative free will...”

**COMMENT**

This is a list of things in which free will is involved.
The Universal Father bestows personality. Personality is not definable, but its components can be recognized. Personality is both unique and changeless. Personality is characterized by self-consciousness and free will. Personality recognizes the three basic mind realities of the cosmos.

## 9. REALITY OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS

### I. UB 16:9.1 — “The cosmic-mind-endowed...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s284_15"></a>[UB 16:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_1) — “The cosmic-mind-endowed...”

**COMMENT**

1. The cosmic-minded, Adjuster-indwelt person possesses innate recognition of:
	- A. Energy reality—the fact of God.
	- B. Mind reality—the law of God.
	- C. Spirit reality—the love of God.
2. Human experience is validated by the unification of these reality responses.

### II. UB 16:9.3 — “If mortal man fails...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s296_15"></a>[UB 16:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_3) — “If mortal man fails...”

**COMMENT**

1. When mortal man fails to survive:
	- A. Spiritual values survive in the Thought Adjuster.
	- B. Personality values (but not identity) persist in the actualizing Supreme Being.
2. Personality identity survives in the survival of the soul.

### III. UB 16:9.9 — “Self-consciousness is in essence...”

**REFERENCE**: <a id="s307_15"></a>[UB 16:9.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_9) — “Self-consciousness is in essence...”

**COMMENT**

Four factors are inherent in human self-consciousness:
	- A. The quest for knowledge.
	- B. The quest for moral values.
	- C. The quest for spiritual values.
	- D. The quest for personality values.
The evolving soul has survival qualities. Civilizations perish, but science, morality, and religion survive. Only a God-knowing person can love another as he loves himself. The basis of worship.
