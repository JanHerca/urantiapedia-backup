## SECTION 1. COMPONENTS AND ATTRIBUTES OF URANTIA MORTALS

### I. **Mind Dominance of Matter**

#### A. Cosmic mind.

1. Source of the cosmic mind.

	> “The Master Spirits are the sevenfold source of the cosmic mind, the intellectual potential of the grand universe. This cosmic mind is a subabsolute manifestation of the mind of the Third Source and Center and, in certain ways, is functionally related to the mind of the evolving Supreme Being.” <a id="s35_299"></a>[UB 16:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_1)

2. Influence of the Master Spirits on Urantians.

	> “On a world like Urantia we do not encounter the direct influence of the Seven Master Spirits in the affairs of the human races. You live under the immediate influence of the Creative Spirit of Nebadon. Nevertheless these same Master Spirits dominate the basic reactions of all creature mind because they are the actual sources of the intellectual and spiritual potentials which have been specialized in the local universes for function in the lives of those individuals who inhabit the evolutionary worlds of time and space.” <a id="s39_530"></a>[UB 16:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_2)

3. The cosmic mind responds to three levels of universe reality.

	> “The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are:
	> “1. _Causation_—the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination.
	> “2. _Duty_—the reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination.
	> “3. _Worship_—the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination.” <a id="s46_394"></a>[UB 16:6.5-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_5)

4. These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights are innate in the minds of all will creatures.

	> “These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, these cosmic responses, are innate in the cosmic mind, which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self-consciousness of reflective thinking. But it is sad to record that so few persons on Urantia take delight in cultivating these qualities of courageous and independent cosmic thinking.” <a id="s50_439"></a>[UB 16:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_1)

5. The creative mind is dominant and always functions in seven directions.

	> “The evolution of mechanisms implies and indicates the concealed presence and dominance of creative mind. The ability of the mortal intellect to conceive, design, and create automatic mechanisms demonstrates the superior, creative, and purposive qualities of man’s mind as the dominant influence on the planet. Mind always reaches out towards:
	> “1. Creation of material mechanisms.
	> “2. Discovery of hidden mysteries.
	> “3. Exploration of remote situations.
	> “4. Formulation of mental systems.
	> “5. Attainment of wisdom goals.
	> “6. Achievement of spirit levels.
	> “7. The accomplishment of divine destinies—supreme, ultimate, and absolute.” <a id="s61_80"></a>[UB 42:12.1-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_1)

6. Function of creative mind in producing a mechanism of identity.

	> “Mind is always creative. The mind endowment of an individual animal, mortal, morontian, spirit ascender, or finality attainer is always competent to produce a suitable and serviceable body for the living creature identity. But the presence phenomenon of a personality or the pattern of an identity, as such, is not a manifestation of energy, either physical, mindal, or spiritual. The personality form is the _pattern_ aspect of a living being; it connotes the _arrangement_ of energies, and this, plus life and motion, is the _mechanism_ of creature existence.” <a id="s65_567"></a>[UB 42:12.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_9)

7. There are four inherent reality realisations in the self-conscious mind.

	> “Self-consciousness is in essence a communal consciousness: God and man, Father and son, Creator and creature. In human self -consciousness four universe-reality realizations are latent and inherent:
	> “1. The quest for knowledge, the logic of science.
	> “2. The quest for moral values, the sense of duty.
	> “3. The quest for spiritual values, the religious experience.
	> “4. The quest for personality values, the ability to recognize the reality of God as a personality and the concurrent realization of our fraternal relationship with fellow personalities.” <a id="s73_191"></a>[UB 16:9.9-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_9)

8. The liaison of cosmic mind and adjutant mind-spirits evolves a suitable physical tabernacle. Morontia mind individualizes the morontia form.

	> “The liaison of the cosmic mind and the ministry of the adjutant mind-spirits evolve a suitable physical tabernacle for the evolving human being. Likewise does the morontia mind individualize the morontia form for all mortal survivors. As the mortal body is personal and characteristic for every human being, so will the morontia form be highly individual and adequately characteristic of the creative mind which dominates it. No two morontia forms are any more alike than any two human bodies. The Morontia Power Supervisors sponsor, and the attending seraphim provide, the undifferentiated morontia material wherewith the morontia life can begin to work. And after the morontia life it will be found that spirit forms are equally diverse, personal, and characteristic of their respective spirit-mind indwellers.” <a id="s77_818"></a>[UB 42:12.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_11)

#### B. The seven adjutant mind-spirits.

1. Adjutant mind-spirits condition the course of organic evolution.

	> “It is the presence of the seven adjutant mind-spirits on the primitive worlds that conditions the course of organic evolution; that explains why evolution is purposeful and not accidental. These adjutants represent that function of the mind ministry of the Infinite Spirit which is extended to the lower orders of intelligent life through the operations of a local universe Mother Spirit. The adjutants are the children of the Universe Mother Spirit and constitute her personal ministry to the material minds of the realms. Wherever and whenever such mind is manifest, these spirits are variously functioning.” <a id="s83_615"></a>[UB 36:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_1)

2. Mind levels on evolutionary worlds.

	> “Living mind, prior to the appearance of capacity to learn from experience, is the ministry domain of the Master Physical Controllers. Creature mind, before acquiring the ability to recognize divinity and worship Deity, is the exclusive domain of the adjutant spirits. With the appearance of the spiritual response of the creature intellect, such created minds at once become superminded, being instantly encircuited in the spirit cycles of the local universe Mother Spirit.” <a id="s87_479"></a>[UB 36:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_15)

3. The Sons of God can construct the forms of life, but it is the Spirit of God who really contributes the vital spark.

	> “When the Life Carriers have designed the patterns of life, after they have organized the energy systems, there must occur an additional phenomenon; the ‘breath of life’ must be imparted to these lifeless forms. The Sons of God can construct the forms of life, but it is the Spirit of God who really contributes the vital spark. And when the life thus imparted is spent, then again the remaining material body becomes dead matter. When the bestowed life is exhausted, the body returns to the bosom of the material universe from which it was borrowed by the Life Carriers to serve as a transient vehicle for that life endowment which they conveyed to such a visible association of energy-matter.” <a id="s91_699"></a>[UB 36:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_4)

### II. **Personality**

#### A. Function of personality.

1. Personality is original, unique, diverse, and is independent of and antecedent to the bestowal of the Thought Adjuster.

	> “Personality is a unique endowment of original nature whose existence is independent of, and antecedent to, the bestowal of the Thought Adjuster. Nevertheless, the presence of the Adjuster does augment the qualitative manifestation of personality. Thought Adjusters, when they come forth from the Father, are identical in nature, but personality is diverse, original, and exclusive; and the manifestation of personality is further conditioned and qualified by the nature and qualities of the associated energies of a material, mindal, and spiritual nature which constitute the organismal vehicle for personality manifestation.” <a id="s99_631"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3)

2. Personality is the part of an individual we know—it is his identity.

	> “Personalities may be similar, but they are never the same. Persons of a given series, type, order, or pattern may and do resemble one another, but they are never identical. Personality is that feature of an individual which we _know,_ and which enables us to identify such a being at some future time regardless of the nature and extent of changes in form, mind, or spirit status. Personality is that part of any individual which enables us to recognize and positively identify that person as the one we have previously known, no matter how much he may have changed because of the modification of the vehicle of expression and manifestation of his personality.” <a id="s103_666"></a>[UB 16:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_4)

3. Creature personality is distinguished by self-consciousness and relative free will.

	> “Creature personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting and characteristic phenomena of mortal reactive behavior: self-consciousness and associated relative free will.” <a id="s107_179"></a>[UB 16:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_5)

4. The function and range of self-consciousness.

	> “Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. Self-consciousness connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will.” <a id="s111_504"></a>[UB 16:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_6)

5. Personality confers the dignity of cosmic citizenship and is reactive to the three basic realities of the cosmos.

	> “The Urantia type of human personality may be viewed as functioning in a physical mechanism consisting of the planetary modification of the Nebadon type of organism belonging to the electrochemical order of life activation and endowed with the Nebadon order of the Orvonton series of the cosmic mind of parental reproductive pattern. The bestowal of the divine gift of personality upon such a mind-endowed mortal mechanism confers the dignity of cosmic citizenship and enables such a mortal creature forthwith to become reactive to the constitutive recognition of the three basic mind realities of the cosmos: 
	> “1. The mathematical or logical recognition of the uniformity of physical causation.
	> “2. The reasoned recognition of the obligation of moral conduct.
	> “3. The faith-grasp of the fellowship worship of Deity, associated with the loving service of humanity.” <a id="s118_108"></a>[UB 16:8.15-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_15)

6. Personality leads to realization of Deity kinship and responds to the personality gravity circuit of the Universal Father.

	> “The full function of such a personality endowment is the beginning realization of Deity kinship. Such a selfhood, indwelt by a prepersonal fragment of God the Father, is in truth and in fact a spiritual son of God. Such a creature not only discloses capacity for the reception of the gift of the divine presence but also exhibits reactive response to the personality-gravity circuit of the Paradise Father of all personalities.” <a id="s122_433"></a>[UB 16:8.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_19)

#### B. Attributes of personality.

1. Personalities of different stages and in varied beings are able to recognize both spirit and material beings.

	> “There are certain types of beings who are capable of discerning the reality of the creatures of both the spirit and the material worlds. Belonging to this class are the so-called fourth creatures of the Havona Servitals and the fourth creatures of the conciliators. The angels of time and space are endowed with the ability to discern both spirit and material beings as also are the ascending mortals subsequent to deliverance from the life in the flesh. After attainment of the higher spirit levels the ascenders are able to recognize material, morontia, and spirit realities.” <a id="s128_583"></a>[UB 44:0.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p0_17)

2. Ascending personalities never lose the ability to recognize those they have known on previous levels of existence.

	> “There is also here with me a Mighty Messenger from Uversa, an ascendant Adjuster-fused, onetime mortal being, and he perceives you as you are, and at the same time he visualizes the Solitary Messenger, the supernaphim, and other celestial beings present. Never in your long ascendancy will you lose the power to recognize your associates of former existences. Always, as you ascend inward in the scale of life, will you retain the ability to recognize and fraternize with the fellow beings of your previous and lower levels of experience. Each new translation or resurrection will add one more group of spirit beings to your vision range without in the least depriving you of the ability to recognize your friends and fellows of former estates.” <a id="s132_750"></a>[UB 44:0.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p0_18)

### III. **Spirit Dominance**

#### A. Relation of physical, spiritual, and mindal energies.

1. Each type of energy is dominant in different situations.

	> “Physical, spiritual, and mindal energies, as such and in their pure states, do not fully interact as actuals of the phenomenal universes. On Paradise the three energies are co-ordinate, in Havona co-ordinated, while in the universe levels of finite activities there must be encountered all ranges of material, mindal, and spiritual dominance. In nonpersonal situations of time and space, physical energy seems to predominate, but it also appears that the more nearly spirit-mind function approaches divinity of purpose and supremacy of action, the more nearly does the spirit phase become dominant; that on the ultimate level spirit-mind may become all but completely dominant. On the absolute level spirit certainly is dominant. And from there on out through the realms of time and space, wherever a divine spirit reality is present, whenever a real spirit-mind is functioning, there always tends to be produced a material or physical counterpart of that spirit reality.” <a id="s140_977"></a>[UB 42:12.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_13)

2. The spirit is the creative reality.

	> “The spirit is the creative reality; the physical counterpart is the time-space reflection of the spirit reality, the physical repercussion of the creative action of spirit-mind.” <a id="s144_183"></a>[UB 42:12.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_14)

3. Mind dominates matter, and in turn is controlled by spirit.

	> “Mind universally dominates matter, even as it is in turn responsive to the ultimate overcontrol of spirit. And with mortal man, only that mind which freely submits itself to the spirit direction can hope to survive the mortal time-space existence as an immortal child of the eternal spirit world of the Supreme, the Ultimate, and the Absolute: the Infinite.” <a id="s148_363"></a>[UB 42:12.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_15)

4. Spirit identification, Adjuster fusion, is the secret of survival and Paradise attainment.

	> “Spirit identification constitutes the secret of personal survival and determines the destiny of spiritual ascension.” <a id="s152_122"></a>[UB 40:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_4)

	> “It is the Adjuster who creates within man that unquenchable yearning and incessant longing to be like God, to attain Paradise, and there before the actual person of Deity to worship the infinite source of the divine gift. The Adjuster is the living presence which actually links the mortal son with his Paradise Father and draws him nearer and nearer to the Father. The Adjuster is our compensatory equalization of the enormous universe tension which is created by the distance of man’s removal from God and by the degree of his partiality in contrast with the universality of the eternal Father.
	> 
	> “The Adjuster is an absolute essence of an infinite being imprisoned within the mind of a finite creature which, depending on the choosing of such a mortal, can eventually consummate this temporary union of God and man and veritably actualize a new order of being for unending universe service. The Adjuster is the divine universe reality which factualizes the truth that God is man’s Father. The Adjuster is man’s infallible cosmic compass, always and unerringly pointing the soul Godward.” <a id="s156_495"></a>[UB 107:0.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_5)

## SECTION 2. PREHUMAN MAMMALS

> “About one million years ago the immediate ancestors of mankind made their appearance by three successive and sudden mutations stemming from early stock of the lemur type of placental mammal. The dominant factors of these early lemurs were derived from the western or later American group of the evolving life plasm. But before establishing the direct line of human ancestry, this strain was reinforced by contributions from the central life implantation evolved in Africa. The eastern life group contributed little or nothing to the actual production of the human species.” <a id="s160_577"></a>[UB 62:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p0_1)

### I. **The Early Lemur Types**

#### A. Derivation and migration of early lemur types.

1. The lemur ancestors of the human species are not directly related to present-day lemurs.

	> “The early lemurs concerned in the ancestry of the human species were not directly related to the pre-existent tribes of gibbons and apes then living in Eurasia and northern Africa, whose progeny have survived to the present time. Neither were they the offspring of the modern type of lemur, though springing from an ancestor common to both but long since extinct.” <a id="s168_369"></a>[UB 62:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p1_1)

2. Migration of North American lemurs to southwestern Asia where the human race had its origin.

	> “While these early lemurs evolved in the Western Hemisphere, the establishment of the direct mammalian ancestry of mankind took place in southwestern Asia, in the original area of the central life implantation but on the borders of the eastern regions. Several million years ago the North American type lemurs had migrated westward over the Bering land bridge and had slowly made their way southwestward along the Asiatic coast. These migrating tribes finally reached the salubrious region lying between the then expanded Mediterranean Sea and the elevating mountainous regions of the Indian peninsula. In these lands to the west of India they united with other and favorable strains, thus establishing the ancestry of the human race.” <a id="s172_739"></a>[UB 62:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p1_2)

### II. **The Dawn Mammals**

#### A. Appearance and physical characteristics.

1. One million years ago the dawn mammals suddenly appeared.

	> “A little more than one million years ago the Mesopotamian dawn mammals, the direct descendants of the North American lemur type of placental mammal, _suddenly_ appeared. They were active little creatures, almost three feet tall; and while they did not habitually walk on their hind legs, they could easily stand erect. They were hairy and agile and chattered in monkeylike fashion, but unlike the simian tribes, they were flesh eaters. They had a primitive opposable thumb as well as a highly useful grasping big toe. From this point onward the prehuman species successively developed the opposable thumb while they progressively lost the grasping power of the great toe. The later ape tribes retained the grasping big toe but never developed the human type of thumb.
	> 
	> “These dawn mammals attained full growth when three or four years of age, having a potential life span, on the average, of about twenty years. As a rule offspring were born singly, although twins were occasional.” <a id="s182_217"></a>[UB 62:2.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_1)

#### B. Instincts, emotions, habits.

1. Many humanlike emotions were manifested in the behavior of these dawn mammals.

	> “The members of this new species had the largest brains for their size of any animal that had theretofore existed on earth. They experienced many of the emotions and shared numerous instincts which later characterized primitive man, being highly curious and exhibiting considerable elation when successful at any undertaking. Food hunger and sex craving were well developed, and a definite sex selection was manifested in a crude form of courtship and choice of mates. They would fight fiercely in defense of their kindred and were quite tender in family associations, possessing a sense of self-abasement bordering on shame and remorse. They were very affectionate and touchingly loyal to their mates, but if circumstances separated them, they would choose new partners.” <a id="s188_776"></a>[UB 62:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_3)

2. They built treetop homes and developed a great fear capacity.

	> “Being small of stature and having keen minds to realize the dangers of their forest habitat, they developed an extraordinary fear which led to those wise precautionary measures that so enormously contributed to survival, such as their construction of crude shelters in the high treetops which eliminated many of the perils of ground life. The beginning of the fear tendencies of mankind more specifically dates from these days.” <a id="s192_433"></a>[UB 62:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_4)

3. They were gregarious, bellicose, and pugnacious. They destroyed their inferior neighbors.

	> “These dawn mammals developed more of a tribal spirit than had ever been previously exhibited. They were, indeed, highly gregarious but nevertheless exceedingly pugnacious when in any way disturbed in the ordinary pursuit of their routine life, and they displayed fiery tempers when their anger was fully aroused. Their bellicose natures, however, served a good purpose; superior groups did not hesitate to make war on their inferior neighbors, and thus, by selective survival, the species was progressively improved. They very soon dominated the life of the smaller creatures of this region, and very few of the older noncarnivorous monkeylike tribes survived.” <a id="s196_666"></a>[UB 62:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_5)

4. In seventy generations suddenly appeared the ancestors of the next step in the evolution of the human race.

	> “These aggressive little animals multiplied and spread over the Mesopotamian peninsula for more than one thousand years, constantly improving in physical type and general intelligence. And it was just seventy generations after this new tribe had taken origin from the highest type of lemur ancestor that the next epoch-making development occurred—the _sudden_ differentiation of the ancestors of the next vital step in the evolution of human beings on Urantia.” <a id="s200_465"></a>[UB 62:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_6)

#### C. Extinction.

1. Mid-mammals eventually destroyed all the dawn mammals.

	> “When the numbers of this new and superior group grew great, war, relentless war, broke out; and when the terrible struggle was over, not a single individual of the pre-existent and ancestral race of dawn mammals remained alive. The less numerous but more powerful and intelligent offshoot of the species had survived at the expense of their ancestors.” <a id="s206_357"></a>[UB 62:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_4)

### III. **The Mid-Mammals**

#### A. Appearance and characteristics.

1. The mid-mammal twins are born.

	> “Early in the career of the dawn mammals, in the treetop abode of a superior pair of these agile creatures, twins were born, one male and one female. Compared with their ancestors, they were really handsome little creatures. They had little hair on their bodies, but this was no disability as they lived in a warm and equable climate.” <a id="s214_339"></a>[UB 62:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_1)

2. Physical characteristics of the mid-mammals.

	> “These children grew to be a little over four feet in height. They were in every way larger than their parents, having longer legs and shorter arms. They had almost perfectly opposable thumbs, just about as well adapted for diversified work as the present human thumb. They walked upright, having feet almost as well suited for walking as those of the later human races.” <a id="s218_375"></a>[UB 62:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_2)

#### B. Instincts, emotions, habits.

1. Mid-mammals became the terror of their part of the world.

	> “And now, for almost fifteen thousand years (six hundred generations), this creature became the terror of this part of the world. All of the great and vicious animals of former times had perished. The large beasts native to these regions were not carnivorous, and the larger species of the cat family, lions and tigers, had not yet invaded this peculiarly sheltered nook of the earth’s surface. Therefore did these mid-mammals wax valiant and subdue the whole of their corner of creation.” <a id="s224_493"></a>[UB 62:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_5)

2. Their life span was twenty-five years; near-human traits appeared.

	> “Compared with the ancestral species, the mid-mammals were an improvement in every way. Even their potential life span was longer, being about twenty-five years. A number of rudimentary human traits appeared in this new species. In addition to the innate propensities exhibited by their ancestors, these mid-mammals were capable of showing disgust in certain repulsive situations. They further possessed a well-defined hoarding instinct; they would hide food for subsequent use and were greatly given to the collection of smooth round pebbles and certain types of round stones suitable for defensive and offensive ammunition.” <a id="s228_630"></a>[UB 62:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_6)

3. Mental and social endowments of the mid-mammals.

	> “Their brains were inferior to, and smaller than, those of human beings but very superior to, and comparatively much larger than, those of their ancestors. The twins early displayed superior intelligence and were soon recognized as the heads of the whole tribe of dawn mammals, really instituting a primitive form of social organization and a crude economic division of labor. This brother and sister mated and soon enjoyed the society of twenty-one children much like themselves, all more than four feet tall and in every way superior to the ancestral species. This new group formed the nucleus of the mid-mammals.” <a id="s232_620"></a>[UB 62:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_3)

4. The mid-mammals were the first to construct ground dwellings.

	> “These mid-mammals were the first to exhibit a definite construction propensity, as shown in their rivalry in the building of both treetop homes and their many-tunneled subterranean retreats; they were the first species of mammals ever to provide for safety in both arboreal and underground shelters. They largely forsook the trees as places of abode, living on the ground during the day and sleeping in the treetops at night.” <a id="s236_431"></a>[UB 62:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_7)

5. Near extinction.

	> “As time passed, the natural increase in numbers eventually resulted in serious food competition and sex rivalry, all of which culminated in a series of internecine battles that nearly destroyed the entire species. These struggles continued until only one group of less than one hundred individuals was left alive. But peace once more prevailed, and this lone surviving tribe built anew its treetop bedrooms and once again resumed a normal and semipeaceful existence.” <a id="s240_472"></a>[UB 62:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_8)

### IV. **The Primates**

#### A. Appearance and characteristics.

1. Birth of the Primates twins.

	> “Soon after the completion of their home, this couple, veterans of so many struggles, found themselves the proud parents of twins, the most interesting and important animals ever to have been born into the world up to that time, for they were the first of the new species of _Primates_ constituting the next vital step in prehuman evolution.” <a id="s248_346"></a>[UB 62:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_10)

2. Physical characteristics.

	> “Going back to the birth of the superior twins, one male and one female, to the two leading members of the mid-mammal tribe: These animal babies were of an unusual order; they had still less hair on their bodies than their parents and, when very young, insisted on walking upright. Their ancestors had always learned to walk on their hind legs, but these Primates twins stood erect from the beginning. They attained a height of over five feet, and their heads grew larger in comparison with others among the tribe. While early learning to communicate with each other by means of signs and sounds, they were never able to make their people understand these new symbols.” <a id="s252_673"></a>[UB 62:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4_1)

3. Flight to Mesopotamia.

	> “When about fourteen years of age, they fled from the tribe, going west to raise their family and establish the new species of Primates. And these new creatures are very properly denominated _Primates_ since they were the direct and immediate animal ancestors of the human family itself.
	> 
	> “Thus it was that the Primates came to occupy a region on the west coast of the Mesopotamian peninsula as it then projected into the southern sea, while the less intelligent and closely related tribes lived around the peninsula point and up the eastern shore line.” <a id="s258_269"></a>[UB 62:4.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4_2)

4. Improvements in characteristics of Primates over their ancestors.

	> “The Primates were more human and less animal than their mid-mammal predecessors. The skeletal proportions of this new species were very similar to those of the primitive human races. The human type of hand and foot had fully developed, and these creatures could walk and even run as well as any of their later-day human descendants. They largely abandoned tree life, though continuing to resort to the treetops as a safety measure at night, for like their earlier ancestors, they were greatly subject to fear. The increased use of their hands did much to develop inherent brain power, but they did not yet possess minds that could really be called human.
	> 
	> “Although in emotional nature the Primates differed little from their forebears, they exhibited more of a human trend in all of their propensities. They were, indeed, splendid and superior animals, reaching maturity at about ten years of age and having a natural life span of about forty years. That is, they might have lived that long had they died natural deaths, but in those early days very few animals ever died a natural death; the struggle for existence was altogether too intense.” <a id="s264_493"></a>[UB 62:4.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4_4)

#### B. Origin of the human race on Urantia.

1. The Primates gave birth to the first true human beings.

	> “And now, after almost nine hundred generations of development, covering about twenty-one thousand years from the origin of the dawn mammals, the Primates _suddenly_ gave birth to two remarkable creatures, the first true human beings.
	> 
	> “Thus it was that the dawn mammals, springing from the North American lemur type, gave origin to the mid-mammals, and these mid-mammals in turn produced the superior Primates, who became the immediate ancestors of the primitive human race. The Primates tribes were the last vital link in the evolution of man, but in less than five thousand years not a single individual of these extraordinary tribes was left.” <a id="s272_415"></a>[UB 62:4.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4_6)

### V. **Recapitulation**

#### A. Evolutionary history of prehuman mammals.

1. Mutations occur suddenly.

	> “The great event of this glacial period was the evolution of primitive man. Slightly to the west of India, on land now under water and among the offspring of Asiatic migrants of the older North American lemur types, the dawn mammals _suddenly_ appeared. These small animals walked mostly on their hind legs, and they possessed large brains in proportion to their size and in comparison with the brains of other animals. In the seventieth generation of this order of life a new and higher group of animals _suddenly_ differentiated. These new mid-mammals—almost twice the size and height of their ancestors and possessing proportionately increased brain power—had only well established themselves when the Primates, the third vital mutation, _suddenly_ appeared. (At this same time, a retrograde development within the mid-mammal stock gave origin to the simian ancestry; and from that day to this the human branch has gone forward by progressive evolution, while the simian tribes have remained stationary or have actually retrogressed.)” <a id="s280_1042"></a>[UB 61:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_1)

2. Dangers that threatened the course of evolution.

	> “You can hardly realize by what narrow margins your prehuman ancestors missed extinction from time to time. Had the ancestral frog of all humanity jumped two inches less on a certain occasion, the whole course of evolution would have been markedly changed. The immediate lemurlike mother of the dawn-mammal species escaped death no less than five times by mere hairbreadth margins before she gave birth to the father of the new and higher mammalian order. But the closest call of all was when lightning struck the tree in which the prospective mother of the Primates twins was sleeping. Both of these mid-mammal parents were severely shocked and badly burned; three of their seven children were killed by this bolt from the skies. These evolving animals were almost superstitious. This couple whose treetop home had been struck were really the leaders of the more progressive group of the midmammal species; and following their example, more than half the tribe, embracing the more intelligent families, moved about two miles away from this locality and began the construction of new treetop abodes and new ground shelters—their transient retreats in time of sudden danger.” <a id="s284_1178"></a>[UB 62:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_9)

#### B. Origin of simian tribes.

1. Separation of the superior and inferior strains of the Primates.

	> “Contemporaneously with the birth of these Primates twins, another couple—a peculiarly retarded male and female of the mid-mammal tribe, a couple that were both mentally and physically inferior-also gave birth to twins. These twins, one male and one female, were indifferent to conquest; they were concerned only with obtaining food and, since they would not eat flesh, soon lost all interest in seeking prey. These retarded twins became the founders of the modern simian tribes. Their descendants sought the warmer southern regions with their mild climates and an abundance of tropical fruits, where they have continued much as of that day except for those branches which mated with the earlier types of gibbons and apes and have greatly deteriorated in consequence.” <a id="s290_772"></a>[UB 62:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_11)

2. Relation of modern man to the simian tribes.

	> “And so it may be readily seen that man and the ape are related only in that they sprang from the mid-mammals, a tribe in which there occurred the contemporaneous birth and subsequent segregation of two pairs of twins: the inferior pair destined to produce the modern types of monkey, baboon, chimpanzee, and gorilla; the superior pair destined to continue the line of ascent which evolved into man himself.
	> 
	> “Modern man and the simians did spring from the same tribe and species but not from the same parents. Man’s ancestors are descended from the superior strains of the selected remnant of this mid-mammal tribe, whereas the modern simians (excepting certain pre-existent types of lemurs, gibbons, apes, and other monkeylike creatures) are the descendants of the most inferior couple of this mid-mammal group, a couple who only survived by hiding themselves in a subterranean food-storage retreat for more than two weeks during the last fierce battle of their tribe, emerging only after the hostilities were well over.” <a id="s296_618"></a>[UB 62:3.12-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p3_12)

## SECTION 3. HUMAN BEINGS

### I. **Evolution of Man**

#### A. The first human beings.

1. In A.D. 1934, the human race was 993,419 years old.

	> “From the year A.D. 1934 back to the birth of the first two human beings is just 993,419 years.” <a id="s306_100"></a>[UB 62:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_1)

2. The first human beings appeared during the third glacier. Their sole survivors are the Eskimos.

	> “_1,000,000_ years ago Urantia was registered as an _inhabited world_. A mutation within the stock of the progressing Primates _suddenly_ produced two primitive human beings, the actual ancestors of mankind.
	> 
	> “This event occurred at about the time of the beginning of the third glacial advance; thus it may be seen that your early ancestors were born and bred in a stimulating, invigorating, and difficult environment. And the sole survivors of these Urantia aborigines, the Eskimos, even now prefer to dwell in frigid northern climes.” <a id="s312_331"></a>[UB 61:6.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_2)

3. Physical characteristics and life span.

	> “These two remarkable creatures were true human beings. They possessed perfect human thumbs, as had many of their ancestors, while they had just as perfect feet as the present-day human races. They were walkers and runners, not climbers; the grasping function of the big toe was absent, completely absent. When danger drove them to the treetops, they climbed just like the humans of today would. They would climb up the trunk of a tree like a bear and not as would a chimpanzee or a gorilla, swinging up by the branches.
	> 
	> “These first human beings (and their descendants) reached full maturity at twelve years of age and possessed a potential life span of about seventy-five years.” <a id="s318_164"></a>[UB 62:5.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_2)

4. Emotions and feelings.

	> “Many new emotions early appeared in these human twins. They experienced admiration for both objects and other beings and exhibited considerable vanity. But the most remarkable advance in emotional development was the sudden appearance of a new group of really human feelings, the worshipful group, embracing awe, reverence, humility, and even a primitive form of gratitude. Fear, joined with ignorance of natural phenomena, is about to give birth to primitive religion.
	> 
	> “Not only were such human feelings manifested in these primitive humans, but many more highly evolved sentiments were also present in rudimentary form. They were mildly cognizant of pity, shame, and reproach and were acutely conscious of love, hate, and revenge, being also susceptible to marked feelings of jealousy.” <a id="s324_322"></a>[UB 62:5.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_4)

5. The early life of the first two human beings.

	> “These first two humans—the twins—were a great trial to their Primates parents. They were so curious and adventurous that they nearly lost their lives on numerous occasions before they were eight years old. As it was, they were rather well scarred up by the time they were twelve.
	> 
	> “Very early they learned to engage in verbal communication; by the age of ten they had worked out an improved sign and word language of almost half a hundred ideas and had greatly improved and expanded the crude communicative technique of their ancestors. But try as hard as they might, they were able to teach only a few of their new signs and symbols to their parents.” <a id="s330_375"></a>[UB 62:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_6)

6. The noontide tryst—the decision of the twins to flee from home, to found the human race.

	> “When about nine years of age, they journeyed off down the river one bright day and held a momentous conference. Every celestial intelligence stationed on Urantia, including myself, was present as an observer of the transactions of this noontide tryst. On this eventful day they arrived at an understanding to live with and for each other, and this was the first of a series of such agreements which finally culminated in the decision to flee from their inferior animal associates and to journey northward, little knowing that they were thus to found the human race.” <a id="s334_571"></a>[UB 62:5.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_8)

7. Migration of the twins northward with the guidance of Life Carriers to escape biologic degradation by admixture with their inferior relatives.

	> “While we were all greatly concerned with what these two little savages were planning, we were powerless to control the working of their minds; we did not—could not—arbitrarily influence their decisions. But within the permissible limits of planetary function, we, the Life Carriers, together with our associates, all conspired to lead the human twins northward and far from their hairy and partially tree-dwelling people. And so, by reason of their own intelligent choice, the twins did _migrate_, and because of our supervision they migrated _northward_ to a secluded region where they escaped the possibility of biologic degradation through admixture with their inferior relatives of the Primates tribes.” <a id="s338_712"></a>[UB 62:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_9)

8. The sacrifice of the mother to save the twins.

	> “Shortly before their departure from the home forests they lost their mother in a gibbon raid. While she did not possess their intelligence, she did have a worthy mammalian affection of a high order for her offspring, and she fearlessly gave her life in the attempt to save the wonderful pair. Nor was her sacrifice in vain, for she held off the enemy until the father arrived with reinforcements and put the invaders to rout.” <a id="s342_431"></a>[UB 62:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_10)

9. The tragic end of the father of the human twins.

	> “Soon after this young couple forsook their associates to found the human race, their Primates father became disconsolate—he was heartbroken. He refused to eat, even when food was brought to him by his other children. His brilliant offspring having been lost, life did not seem worth living among his ordinary fellows; so he wandered off into the forest, was set upon by hostile gibbons and beaten to death.” <a id="s346_412"></a>[UB 62:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_11)

#### B. Evolution of the human mind.

1. Successive functioning of the first five adjutant spirits.

	> “At first only the _spirit of intuition_ could function in the instinctive and reflex behavior of the primordial animal life. With the differentiation of higher types, the _spirit of understanding_ was able to endow such creatures with the gift of spontaneous association of ideas. Later on we observed the _spirit of courage_ in operation; evolving animals really developed a crude form of protective self-consciousness. Subsequent to the appearance of the mammalian groups, we beheld the _spirit of knowledge_ manifesting itself in increased measure. And the evolution of the higher mammals brought the function of the _spirit of counsel_, with the resulting growth of the herd instinct and the beginnings of primitive social development.” <a id="s352_745"></a>[UB 62:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_3)

2. The first functioning of the adjutant spirits of worship and wisdom.

	> “Increasingly, on down through the dawn mammals, the mid-mammals, and the Primates, we had observed the augmented service of the first five adjutants. But never had the remaining two, the highest mind ministers, been able to function in the Urantia type of evolutionary mind.
	> 
	> “Imagine our joy one day—the twins were about ten years old-when the _spirit of worship_ made its first contact with the mind of the female twin and shortly thereafter with the male. We knew that something closely skin to human mind was approaching culmination; and when, about a year later, they finally resolved, as a result of meditative thought and purposeful decision, to flee from home and journey north, then did the _spirit of wisdom_ begin to function on Urantia and in these two now recognized human minds.
	> 
	> “There was an immediate and new order of mobilization of the seven adjutant mind-spirits. We were alive with expectation; we realized that the long-waited-for hour was approaching; we knew we were upon the threshold of the realization of our protracted effort to evolve will creatures on Urantia.” <a id="s360_301"></a>[UB 62:6.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_4)

#### C. Recognition as an inhabited world.

1. The recognition of Urantia as an inhabited planet.

	> “We did not have to wait long. At noon, the day after the runaway of the twins, there occurred the initial test flash of the universe circuit signals at the planetary reception-focus of Urantia. We were, of course, all astir with the realization that a great event was impending; but since this world was a life-experiment station, we had not the slightest idea of just how we would be apprised of the recognition of intelligent life on the planet. But we were not long in suspense. On the third day after the elopement of the twins, and before the Life Carrier corps departed, there arrived the Nebadon archangel of initial planetary circuit establishment.” <a id="s366_662"></a>[UB 62:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_1)

2. Message to the Life Carriers in recognition of the existence of human mind on Urantia.

	> “It was an eventful day on Urantia when our small group gathered about the planetary pole of space communication and received the first message from Salvington over the newly established mind circuit of the planet. And this first message, dictated by the chief of the archangel corps, said:
	> 
	> “‘To the Life Carriers on Urantia—Greetings! We transmit assurance of great pleasure on Salvington, Edentia, and Jerusem in honor of the registration on the headquarters of Nebadon of the signal of the existence on Urantia of mind of will dignity. The purposeful decision of the twins to flee northward and segregate their offspring from their inferior ancestors has been noted. This is the first decision of mind—the human type of mind—on Urantia and automatically establishes the circuit of communication over which this initial message of acknowledgment is transmitting.’” <a id="s372_579"></a>[UB 62:7.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_2)

3. Instructions to the Life Carriers on Urantia concerning their future relation to the human race.

	> “Next over this new circuit came the greetings of the Most Highs of Edentia, containing instructions for the resident Life Carriers forbidding us to interfere with the pattern of life we had established. We were directed not to intervene in the affairs of human progress. It should not be inferred that Life Carriers ever arbitrarily and mechanically interfere with the natural outworking of the planetary evolutionary plans, for we do not. But up to this time we had been permitted to manipulate the environment and shield the life plasm in a special manner, and it was this extraordinary, but wholly natural, supervision that was to be discontinued.” <a id="s376_656"></a>[UB 62:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_4)

4. The Lucifer message to the Life Carriers in acceptance of their work.

	> “And no sooner had the Most Highs left off speaking than the beautiful message of Lucifer, then sovereign of the Satania system, began to planetize. Now the Life Carriers heard the welcome words of their own chief and received his permission to return to Jerusem. This message from Lucifer contained the official acceptance of the Life Carriers’ work on Urantia and absolved us from all future criticism of any of our efforts to improve the life patterns of Nebadon as established in the Satania system.” <a id="s380_508"></a>[UB 62:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_5)

5. It was—from A.D. 1934—993,408 years ago that Urantia was recognized as an inhabited planet.

	> “It is just 993,408 years ago (from the year A.D. 1934) that Urantia was formally recognized as a planet of human habitation in the universe of Nebadon. Biologic evolution had once again achieved the human levels of will dignity; man had arrived on planet 606 of Satania.” <a id="s384_276"></a>[UB 62:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_7)

7. Urantia was recognized when the twins were eleven years old and they were named Andon and Fonta.

	> “Urantia was registered as an inhabited world when the first two human beings—the twins—were eleven years old, and before they had become the parents of the first-born of the second generation of actual human beings. And the archangel message from Salvington, on this occasion of formal planetary recognition, closed with these words:
	> 
	> “‘Man-mind has appeared on 606 of Satania, and these parents of the new race shall be called _Andon_ and _Fonta_. And all archangels pray that these creatures may speedily be endowed with the personal indwelling of the gift of the spirit of the Universal Father.” <a id="s390_267"></a>[UB 63:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p0_1)

7. Andon and Fonta called each other Sonta-an and Sonta-en.

	> “Andon is the Nebadon name which signifies ‘the first Fatherlike creature to exhibit human perfection hunger.’ Fonta signifies ‘the first Sonlike creature to exhibit human perfection hunger.’ Andon and Fonta never knew these names until they were bestowed upon them at the time of fusion with their Thought Adjusters. Throughout their mortal sojourn on Urantia they called each other Sonta-an and Sonta-en, Sonta-an meaning ‘loved by mother,’ Sonta-en signifying ‘loved by father.’ They gave themselves these names, and the meanings are significant of their mutual regard and affection.” <a id="s394_591"></a>[UB 63:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p0_3)

### II. **The First Human Family**

#### A. Andon and Fonta.

> “In many respects, Andon and Fonta were the most remarkable pair of human beings that have ever lived on the face of the earth. This wonderful pair, the actual parents of all mankind, were in every way superior to many of their immediate descendants, and they were radically different from all of their ancestors, both immediate and remote.” <a id="s400_344"></a>[UB 63:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p1_1)

1. Their weapons.

	> “While still living with his parents, Andon had fastened a sharp piece of flint on the end of a club, using animal tendons for this purpose, and on no less than a dozen occasions he made good use of such a weapon in saving both his own life and that of his equally adventurous and inquisitive sister, who unfailingly accompanied him on all of his tours of exploration.” <a id="s404_373"></a>[UB 63:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p0_3)

2. Effect of personality and Thought Adjusters.

	> “The decision of Andon and Fonta to flee from the Primates tribes implies a quality of mind far above the baser intelligence which characterized so many of their later descendants who stooped to mate with their retarded cousins of the simian tribes. But their vague feeling of being something more than mere animals was due to the possession of personality and was augmented by the indwelling presence of the Thought Adjusters.” <a id="s408_432"></a>[UB 63:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p1_4)

3. Their relation with their Primates cousins.

	> “After Andon and Fonta had decided to flee northward, they succumbed to their fears for a time, especially the fear of displeasing their father and immediate family. They envisaged being set upon by hostile relatives and thus recognized the possibility of meeting death at the hands of their already jealous tribesmen. As youngsters, the twins had spent most of their time in each other’s company and for this reason had never been overly popular with their animal cousins of the Primates tribe. Nor had they improved their standing in the tribe by building a separate, and a very superior, tree home.
	> 
	> “And it was in this new home among the treetops, one night after they had been awakened by a violent storm, and as they held each other in fearful and fond embrace, that they finally and fully made up their minds to flee from the tribal habitat and the home treetops.” <a id="s414_272"></a>[UB 63:2.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p2_1)

4. Preparations for their eventide elopement.

	> “They had already prepared a crude treetop retreat some half-day’s journey to the north. This was their secret and safe hiding place for the first day away from the home forests. Notwithstanding that the twins shared the Primates’ deathly fear of being on the ground at nighttime, they sallied forth shortly before nightfall on their northern trek. While it required unusual courage for them to undertake this night journey, even with a full moon, they correctly concluded that they were less likely to be missed and pursued by their tribesmen and relatives. And they safely made their previously prepared rendezvous shortly after midnight.” <a id="s418_645"></a>[UB 63:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p2_3)

5. Discovery of the use of flint in making fire.

	> “On their northward journey they discovered an exposed flint deposit and, finding many stones suitably shaped for various uses, gathered up a supply for the future. In attempting to chip these flints so that they would be better adapted for certain purposes, Andon discovered their sparking quality and conceived the idea of building fire. But the notion did not take firm hold of him at the time as the climate was still salubrious and there was little need of fire.
	> 
	> “But the autumn sun was getting lower in the sky, and as they journeyed northward, the nights grew cooler and cooler. Already they had been forced to make use of animal skins for warmth. Before they had been away from home one moon, Andon signified to his mate that he thought he could make fire with the flint. They tried for two months to utilize the flint spark for kindling a fire but only met with failure. Each day this couple would strike the flints and endeavor to ignite the wood. Finally, one evening about the time of the setting of the sun, the secret of the technique was unraveled when it occurred to Fonta to climb a near-by tree to secure an abandoned bird’s nest. The nest was dry and highly inflammable and consequently flared right up into a full blaze the moment the spark fell upon it. They were so surprised and startled at their success that they almost lost the fire, but they saved it by the addition of suitable fuel, and then began the first search for firewood by the parents of all mankind.
	> 
	> “This was one of the most joyous moments in their short but eventful lives. All night long they sat up watching their fire burn, vaguely realizing that they had made a discovery which would make it possible for them to defy climate and thus forever to be independent of their animal relatives of the southern lands. After three days’ rest and enjoyment of the fire, they journeyed on.” <a id="s426_389"></a>[UB 63:2.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p2_4)

6. They learn to make use of different materiìals in starting fire.

	> “The Primates ancestors of Andon had often replenished fire which had been kindled by lightning, but never before had the creatures of earth possessed a method of starting fire at will. But it was a long time before the twins learned that dry moss and other materials would kindle fire just as well as birds’ nests.” <a id="s430_320"></a>[UB 63:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p2_7)

#### B. Andon’s family.

1. The birth of Sontad.

	> “It was almost two years from the night of the twins’ departure from home before their first child was born. They named him Sontad; and Sontad was the first creature to be born on Urantia who was wrapped in protective coverings at the time of birth. The human race had begun, and with this new evolution there appeared the instinct properly to care for the increasingly enfeebled infants which would characterize the progressive development of mind of the intellectual order as contrasted with the more purely animal type.” <a id="s436_527"></a>[UB 63:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p3_1)

2. The children and grandchildren of Andon and Fonta.

	> “Andon and Fonta had nineteen children in all, and they lived to enjoy the association of almost half a hundred grandchildren and half a dozen great-grandchildren. The family was domiciled in four adjoining rock shelters, or semicaves, three of which were interconnected by hallways which had been excavated in the soft limestone with flint tools devised by Andon’s children.” <a id="s440_380"></a>[UB 63:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p3_2)

3. The early Andonites were a clannish people.

	> “These early Andonites evinced a very marked clannish spirit; they hunted in groups and never strayed very far from the homesite. They seemed to realize that they were an isolated and unique group of living beings and should therefore avoid becoming separated. This feeling of intimate kinship was undoubtedly due to the enhanced mind ministry of the adjutant spirits.” <a id="s444_373"></a>[UB 63:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p3_3)

4. The tragic death of Andon and Fonta.

	> “Andon and Fonta labored incessantly for the nurture and uplift of the clan. They lived to the age of forty-two, when both were killed at the time of an earthquake by the falling of an overhanging rock. Five of their children and eleven grandchildren perished with them, and almost a score of their descendants suffered serious injuries.” <a id="s448_342"></a>[UB 63:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p3_4)

5. Sontad became head of the clan and it held together for twenty generations.

	> “Upon the death of his parents, Sontad, despite a seriously injured foot, immediately assumed the leadership of the clan and was ably assisted by his wife, his eldest sister. Their first task was to roll up stones to effectively entomb their dead parents, brothers, sisters, and children. Undue significance should not attach to this act of burial. Their ideas of survival after death were very vague and indefinite, being largely derived from their fantastic and variegated dream life.
	> 
	> “This family of Andon and Fonta held together until the twentieth generation, when combined food competition and social friction brought about the beginning of dispersion.” <a id="s454_176"></a>[UB 63:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p3_5)

6. Physical characteristics of the Andonites.

	> “Primitive man—the Andonites—had black eyes and a swarthy complexion, something of a cross between yellow and red. Melanin is a coloring substance which is found in the skins of all human beings. It is the original Andonic skin pigment. In general appearance and skin color these early Andonites more nearly resembled the present-day Eskimo than any other type of living human beings. They were the first creatures to use the skins of animals as a protection against cold; they had little more hair on their bodies than present-day humans.” <a id="s458_544"></a>[UB 63:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_1)

7. The survival of Andon and Fonta.

	> “Andon and Fonta, the splendid founders of the human race, received recognition at the time of the adjudication of Urantia upon the arrival of the Planetary Prince, and in due time they emerged from the regime of the mansion worlds with citizenship status on Jerusem. Although they have never been permitted to return to Urantia, they are cognizant of the history of the race they founded. They grieved over the Caligastia betrayal, sorrowed because of the Adamic failure, but rejoiced exceedingly when announcement was received that Michael had selected their world as the theater for his final bestowal.
	> 
	> “On Jerusem both Andon and Fonta were fused with their Thought Adjusters, as also were several of their children, including Sontad, but the majority of even their immediate descendants only achieved Spirit fusion.” <a id="s464_218"></a>[UB 63:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p7_1)

8. Andon and Fonta join the reception committee on the first mansion world.

	> “Andon and Fonta, shortly after their arrival on Jerusem, received permission from the System Sovereign to return to the first mansion world to serve with the morontia personalities who welcome the pilgrims of time from Urantia to the heavenly spheres. And they have been assigned indefinitely to this service. They sought to send greetings to Urantia in connection with these revelations, but this request was wisely denied them.
	> 
	> “And this is the recital of the most heroic and fascinating chapter in all the history of Urantia, the story of the evolution, life struggles, death, and eternal survival of the unique parents of all mankind.” <a id="s470_213"></a>[UB 63:7.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p7_3)

### III. **The Andonic Tribes**

#### A. General characteristics.

1. Social conventions developed, humor was lacking, and Andonites were less sensitive than later races.

	> “The tribal life of the animal ancestors of these early men had foreshadowed the beginnings of numerous social conventions, and with the expanding emotions and augmented brain powers of these beings, there was an immediate development in social organization and a new division of clan labor. They were exceedingly imitative, but the play instinct was only slightly developed, and the sense of humor was almost entirely absent. Primitive man smiled occasionally, but he never indulged in hearty laughter. Humor was the legacy of the later Adamic race. These early human beings were not so sensitive to pain nor so reactive to unpleasant situations as were many of the later evolving mortals. Childbirth was not a painful or distressing ordeal to Fonta and her immediate progeny.” <a id="s478_782"></a>[UB 63:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_2)

2. The Andonites had tribal patriotism, but they were deficient in altruism.

	> “They were a wonderful tribe. The males would fight heroically for the safety of their mates and their offspring; the females were affectionately devoted to their children. But their patriotism was wholly limited to the immediate clan. They were very loyal to their families; they would die without question in defense of their children, but they were not able to grasp the idea of trying to make the world a better place for their grandchildren. Altruism was as yet unborn in the human heart, notwithstanding that all of the emotions essential to the birth of religion were already present in these Urantia aborigines.” <a id="s482_624"></a>[UB 63:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_3)

3. Many noble human traits were foreshadowed in these primitive people.

	> “These early men possessed a touching affection for their comrades and certainly had a real, although crude, idea of friendship. It was a common sight in later times, during their constantly recurring battles with the inferior tribes, to see one of these primitive men valiantly fighting with one hand while he struggled on, trying to protect and save an injured fellow warrior. Many of the most noble and highly human traits of subsequent evolutionary development were touchingly foreshadowed in these primitive peoples.<a id="s486_524"></a>[UB 63:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_4)

4. A well-developed language evolved.

	> “Before the extensive dispersion of the Andonic clans a welldeveloped language had evolved from their early efforts to intercommunicate. This language continued to grow, and almost daily additions were made to it because of the new inventions and adaptations to environment which were developed by these active, restless, and curious people. And this language became the word of Urantia, the tongue of the early human family, until the later appearance of the colored races.” <a id="s490_479"></a>[UB 63:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_6)

#### B. Dispersion of the Andonites.

1. Friction developed and wars threatened the extinction of primitive civilization.

	> “As time passed, the Andonic clans grew in number, and the contact of the expanding families developed friction and misunderstandings. Only two things came to occupy the minds of these peoples: hunting to obtain food and fighting to avenge themselves against some real or supposed injustice or insult at the hands of the neighboring tribes.
	> “Family feuds increased, tribal wars broke out, and serious losses were sustained among the very best elements of the more able and advanced groups. Some of these losses were irreparable; some of the most valuable strains of ability and intelligence were forever lost to the world. This early race and its primitive civilization were threatened with extinction by this incessant warfare of the clans.
	> “It is impossible to induce such primitive beings long to live together in peace. Man is the descendant of fighting animals, and when closely associated, uncultured people irritate and offend each other. The Life Carriers know this tendency among evolutionary creatures and accordingly make provision for the eventual separation of developing human beings into at least three, and more often six, distinct and separate races.” <a id="s498_430"></a>[UB 63:4.7-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_7)

2. The Andonic tribes migrated northward and westward—overrunning Europe.

	> “The early Andon races did not penetrate very far into Asia, and they did not at first enter Africa. The geography of those times pointed them north, and farther and farther north these people journeyed until they were hindered by the slowly advancing ice of the third glacier.
	> 
	> “Before this extensive ice sheet reached France and the British Isles, the descendants of Andon and Fonta had pushed on westward over Europe and had established more than one thousand separate settlements along the great rivers leading to the then warm waters of the North Sea.” <a id="s504_282"></a>[UB 63:5.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p5_1)

3. In large numbers they lived along the rivers of France.

	> “These Andonic tribes were the early river dwellers of France; they lived along the river Somme for tens of thousands of years. The Somme is the one river unchanged by the glaciers, running down to the sea in those days much as it does today. And that explains why so much evidence of the Andonic descendants is found along the course of this river valley.” <a id="s508_361"></a>[UB 63:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p5_3)

4. They regularly dwelt in cliffs and grottoes and were clever in building stone huts.

	> “These aborigines of Urantia were not tree dwellers, though in emergencies they still betook themselves to the treetops. They regularly dwelt under the shelter of overhanging cliffs along the rivers and in hillside grottoes which afforded a good view of the approaches and sheltered them from the elements. They could thus enjoy the comfort of their fires without being too much inconvenienced by the smoke. They were not really cave dwellers either, though in subsequent times the later ice sheets came farther south and drove their descendants to the caves. They preferred to camp near the edge of a forest and beside a stream.
	> 
	> “They very early became remarkably clever in disguising their partially sheltered abodes and showed great skill in constructing stone sleeping chambers, dome-shaped stone huts, into which they crawled at night. The entrance to such a hut was closed by rolling a stone in front of it, a large stone which had been placed inside for this purpose before the roof stones were finally put in place.” <a id="s514_398"></a>[UB 63:5.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p5_4)

#### C. Development of primitive culture.

1. Their use of weapons and tools.

	> “The Andonites were fearless and successful hunters and, with the exception of wild berries and certain fruits of the trees, lived exclusively on flesh. As Andon had invented the stone ax, so his descendants early discovered and made effective use of the throwing stick and the harpoon. At last a tool-creating mind was functioning in conjunction with an implement-using hand, and these early humans became highly skillful in the fashioning of flint tools. They traveled far and wide in search of flint, much as present-day humans journey to the ends of the earth in quest of gold, platinum, and diamonds.
	> 
	> “And in many other ways these Andon tribes manifested a degree of intelligence which their retrogressing descendants did not attain in half a million years, though they did again and again rediscover various methods of kindling fire.” <a id="s522_238"></a>[UB 63:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p5_6)

2. Development of art.

	> “The Andonites early developed a fear of the elements—thunder, lightning, rain, snow, hail, and ice. But hunger was the constantly recurring urge of these early days, and since they largely subsisted on animals, they eventually evolved a form of animal worship. To Andon, the larger food animals were symbols of creative might and sustaining power. From time to time it became the custom to designate various of these larger animals as objects of worship. During the vogue of a particular animal, crude outlines of it would be drawn on the walls of the caves, and later on, as continued progress was made in the arts, such an animal god was engraved on various ornaments.” <a id="s526_676"></a>[UB 63:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_3)

3. Physical conditions controlling Andonic migrations.

	> “Primitive man made his evolutionary appearance on earth a little less than one million years ago, and he had a vigorous experience. He instinctively sought to escape the danger of mingling with the inferior simian tribes. But he could not migrate eastward because of the arid Tibetan land elevations, 30,000 feet above sea level; neither could he go south nor west because of the expanded Mediterranean Sea, which then extended eastward to the Indian Ocean; and as he went north, he encountered the advancing ice. But even when further migration was blocked by the ice, and though the dispersing tribes became increasingly hostile, the more intelligent groups never entertained the idea of going southward to live among their hairy tree-dwelling cousins of inferior intellect.” <a id="s530_782"></a>[UB 64:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p1_1)

4. Religious emotions were born of man’s geographic shut-in environment.

	> “Many of man’s earliest religious emotions grew out of his feeling of helplessness in the shut-in environment of this geographic situation—mountains to the right, water to the left, and ice in front. But these progressive Andonites would not turn back to their inferior tree-dwelling relatives in the south.” <a id="s534_312"></a>[UB 64:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p1_2)

5. The Andonites avoided the forests and remained in northern climes.

	> “These Andonites avoided the forests in contrast with the habits of their nohuman relatives. In the forests man has always deteriorated; human evolution has made progress only in the open and in the higher latitudes. The cold and hunger of the open lands stimulate action, invention, and resourcefulness. While these Andonic tribes were developing the pioneers of the present human race amidst the hardships and privations of these rugged northern climes, their backward cousins were luxuriating in the southern tropical forests of the land of their early common origin.” <a id="s538_575"></a>[UB 64:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p1_3)

#### D. Growth of religion.

1. Development of sacrifices.

	> “Very early the Andonic peoples formed the habit of refraining from eating the flesh of the animal of tribal veneration. Presently, in order more suitably to impress the minds of their youths, they evolved a ceremony of reverence which was carried out about the body of one of these venerated animals; and still later on, this primitive performance developed into the more elaborate sacrificial ceremonies of their descendants. And this is the origin of sacrifices as a part of worship. This idea was elaborated by Moses in the Hebrew ritual and was preserved, in principle, by the Apostle Paul as the doctrine of atonement for sin by ‘the shedding of blood.’” <a id="s544_664"></a>[UB 63:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_4)

2. Onagar assumed leadership of the Andonites, bringing peace and religion.

	> “As the Andonic dispersion extended, the cultural and spiritual status of the clans retrogressed for nearly ten thousand years until the days of Onagar, who assumed the leadership of these tribes, brought peace among them, and for the first time, led all of them in the worship of the ‘Breath Giver to men and animals.’” <a id="s548_324"></a>[UB 63:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_1)

3. Andon had a confused philosophy. He reverenced fire, but failed to become a sun worshiper.

	> “Andon’s philosophy had been most confused; he had barely escaped becoming a fire worshiper because of the great comfort derived from his accidental discovery of fire. Reason, however, directed him from his own discovery to the sun as a superior and more awe-inspiring source of heat and light, but it was too remote, and so he failed to become a sun worshiper.” <a id="s552_366"></a>[UB 63:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_2)

4. From his headquarters at Oban, near the Caspian Sea, Onagar sent missionaries far and wide.

	> “Onagar maintained headquarters on the northern shores of the ancient Mediterranean in the region of the present Caspian Sea at a settlement called Oban, the tarrying place on the westward turning of the travel trail leading up northward from the Mesopotamian southland. From Oban he sent out teachers to the remote settlements to spread his new doctrines of one Deity and his concept of the hereafter, which he called the Great Beyond. These emissaries of Onagar were the world’s first missionaries; they were also the first human beings to cook meat, the first regularly to use fire in the preparation of food. They cooked flesh on the ends of sticks and also on hot stones; later on they roasted large pieces in the fire, but their descendants almost entirely reverted to the use of raw flesh.” <a id="s556_801"></a>[UB 63:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_7)

5. Onagar organized a real society and introduced a superior religion. Many were indwelt by Thought Adjusters.

	> “Onagar was born 983, 323 years ago (from A.D. 1934), and he lived to be sixty-nine years of age. The record of the achievements of this master mind and spiritual leader of the pre-Planetary Prince days is a thrilling recital of the organization of these primitive peoples into a real society. He instituted an efficient tribal government, the like of which was not attained by succeeding generations in many millenniums. Never again, until the arrival of the Planetary Prince, was there such a high spiritual civilization on earth. These simple people had a real though primitive religion, but it was subsequently lost to their deteriorating descendants.
	> 
	> “Although both Andon and Fonta had received Thought Adjusters, as had many of their descendants, it was not until the days of Onagar that the Adjusters and guardian seraphim came in great numbers to Urantia. This was, indeed, the golden age of primitive man.” <a id="s562_263"></a>[UB 63:6.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_8)

### IV. **Later Migrations of the Andonites**

#### A. Java man.

1. The Andonites penetrated to England on the west and Java on the east. The Java man was an Andonite.

	> “_950,000_ years ago the descendants of Andon and Fonta had migrated far to the east and to the west. To the west they passed over Europe to France and England. In later times they penetrated eastward as far as Java, where their bones were so recently found —the so-called Java man—and then journeyed on to Tasmania.” <a id="s570_321"></a>[UB 64:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p1_6)

2. Deterioration and threatened extinction of Andonic people.

	> “The groups going west became less contaminated with the backward stocks of mutual ancestral origin than those going east, who mingled so freely with their retarded animal cousins. These unprogressive individuals drifted southward and presently mated with the inferior tribes. Later on, increasing numbers of their mongrel descendants returned to the north to mate with the rapidly expanding Andonic peoples, and such unfortunate unions unfailingly deteriorated the superior stock. Fewer and fewer of the primitive settlements maintained the worship of the Breath Giver. This early dawn civilization was threatened with extinction.
	> 
	> “And thus it has ever been on Urantia. Civilizations of great promise have successively deteriorated and have finally been extinguished by the folly of allowing the superior freely to procreate with the inferior.” <a id="s576_217"></a>[UB 64:1.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p1_7)

#### B. Heidelberg race.

1. The widespread decline of Onagar’s civilization.

	> “_900,000_ years ago the arts of Andon and Fonta and the culture of Onagar were vanishing from the face of the earth; culture, religion, and even flintworking were at their lowest ebb.
	> 
	> “These were the times when large numbers of inferior mongrel groups were arriving in England from southern France. These tribes were so largely mixed with the forest apelike creatures that they were scarcely human. They had no religion but were crude flintworkers and possessed sufficient intelligence to kindle fire.” <a id="s584_322"></a>[UB 64:2.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_1)

2. The Heidelberg race appears, while the Foxhall people of England and the Badonan tribes maintain the remnants of Onagar’s culture.

	> “They were followed in Europe by a somewhat superior and continent from the ice in the north to the Alps and Mediterranean in the south. These tribes are the so-called _Heidelberg race_.
	> 
	> “During this long period of cultural decadence the Foxhall peoples of England and the Badonan tribes northwest of India continued to hold on to some of the traditions of Andon and certain remnants of the culture of Onagar.” <a id="s590_227"></a>[UB 64:2.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_3)

#### C. The Foxhall peoples.

1. The Foxhall people retained much of Onagar’s culture and transmitted it to the ancestors of the ancient Eskimos.

	> “The Foxhall peoples were farthest west and succeeded in retaining much of the Andonic culture; they also preserved their knowledge of flintworking, which they transmitted to their descendants, the ancient ancestors of the Eskimos.” <a id="s596_236"></a>[UB 64:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_5)

2. The Foxhall people were the first human inhabitants of England, but most of their settlements are now under the waters of the English Channel and the North Sea.

	> “Though the remains of the Foxhall peoples were the last to be discovered in England, these Andonites were really the first human beings to live in those regions. At that time the land bridge still connected France with England; and since most of the early settlements of the Andon descendants were located along the rivers and seashores of that early day, they are now under the waters of the English Channel and the North Sea, but some three or four are still above water on the English coast.” <a id="s600_500"></a>[UB 64:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_6)

3. The Foxhall people became admixed with other stocks and survive as the present-day Eskimos.

	> “Many of the more intelligent and spiritual of the Foxhall peoples maintained their racial superiority and perpetuated their primitive religious customs. And these people, as they were later admixed with subsequent stocks, journeyed on west from England after a later ice visitation and have survived as the present-day Eskimos.” <a id="s604_333"></a>[UB 64:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_7)

#### B. The Badonan tribes.

1. Story of the Badonan people.

	> “Besides the Foxhall peoples in the west, another struggling center of culture persisted in the east. This group was located in the foothills of the northwestern Indian highlands among the tribes of Badonan, a great-great-grandson of Andon. These people were the only descendants of Andon who never practiced human sacrifice.
	> 
	> “These highland Badonites occupied an extensive plateau surrounded by forests, traversed by streams, and abounding in game. Like some of their cousins in Tibet, they lived in crude stone huts, hillside grottoes, and semiunderground passages.
	> 
	> “While the tribes of the north grew more and more to fear the ice, those living near the homeland of their origin became exceedingly fearful of the water. They observed the Mesopotamian peninsula gradually sinking into the ocean, and though it emerged several times, the traditions of these primitive races grew up around the dangers of the sea and the fear of periodic engulfment. And this fear, together with their experience with river floods, explains why they sought out the highlands as a safe place in which to live.” <a id="s614_528"></a>[UB 64:3.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p3_1)

2. Out of the Badonan tribes comes the later Neanderthal race.

	> “_850,000_ years ago the superior Badonan tribes began a warfare of extermination directed against their inferior and animalistic neighbors. In less than one thousand years most of the borderland animal groups of these regions had been either destroyed or driven back to the southern forests. This campaign for the extermination of inferiors brought about a slight improvement in the hill tribes of that age. And the mixed descendants of this improved Badonite stock appeared on the stage of action as an apparently new people—the _Neanderthal race_.” <a id="s618_555"></a>[UB 64:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p3_5)

#### E. The Neanderthal races.

1. The Neanderthalers spread east, west, and south and dominated the world for half a million years.

	> “The Neanderthalers were excellent fighters, and they traveled extensively. They gradually spread from the highland centers in northwest India to France on the west, China on the east, and even down into northern Africa. They dominated the world for almost half a million years until the times of the migration of the evolutionary races of color.
	> 
	> “_800,000_ years ago game was abundant; many species of deer, as well as elephants and hippopotamuses, roamed over Europe. Cattle were plentiful; horses and wolves were everywhere. The Neanderthalers were great hunters, and the tribes in France were the first to adopt the practice of giving the most successful hunters the choice of women for wives.” <a id="s626_355"></a>[UB 64:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_1)

2. The fourth glacier forced Neanderthalers south, but the human species had so differentiated there was little danger of mingling with simian stock.

	> “_750,000_ years ago the fourth ice sheet was well on its way south. With their improved implements the Neanderthalers made holes in the ice covering the northern rivers and thus were able to spear the fish which came up to these vents. Ever these tribes retreated before the advancing ice, which at this time made its most extensive invasion of Europe.
	> 
	> “In these times the Siberian glacier was making its southernmost march, compelling early man to move southward, back toward the lands of his origin. But the human species had so differentiated that the danger of further mingling with its nonprogressive simian relatives was greatly lessened.” <a id="s632_296"></a>[UB 64:4.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_4)

3. The fifth glacier witnessed the further spread of Neanderthal culture, but little progress was made and a period of spiritually dark ages occurred and continued until the origin of the colored races.

	> “_550,000_ years ago the advancing glacier again pushed man and the animals south. But this time man had plenty of room in the wide belt of land stretching northeast into Asia and lying between the ice sheet and the then greatly expanded Black Sea extension of the Mediterranean.
	> 
	> “These times of the fourth and fifth glaciers witnessed the further spread of the crude culture of the Neanderthal races. But there was so little progress that it truly appeared as though the attempt to produce a new and modified type of intelligent life on Urantia was about to fail. For almost a quarter of a million years these primitive peoples drifted on, hunting and fighting, by spells improving in certain directions, but, on the whole, steadily retrogressing as compared with their superior Andonic ancestors.
	> 
	> “During these spiritually dark ages the culture of superstitious mankind reached its lowest levels. The Neanderthalers really had no religion beyond a shameful superstition. They were deathly afraid of clouds, more especially of mists and fogs. A primitive religion of the fear of natural forces gradually developed, while animal worship declined as improvement in tools, with abundance of game, enabled these people to live with lessened anxiety about food; the sex rewards of the chase tended greatly to improve hunting skill. This new religion of fear led to attempts to placate the invisible forces behind these natural elements and culminated, later on, in the sacrificing of humans to appease these invisible and unknown physical forces. And this terrible practice of human sacrifice has been perpetuated by the more backward peoples of Urantia right on down to the twentieth century.” <a id="s640_895"></a>[UB 64:4.10-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_10)

## SECTION 4. THE EVOLUTIONARY RACES

### I. **Urantia a Life-Experiment World**

#### A. Life Carrier supervision of the sixtieth Satania experiment.

1. Urantia is a life-experiment world. At least 28 life improvements have been made.

	> “Do not overlook the fact that Urantia was assigned to us as a life-experiment world. On this planet we made our sixtieth attempt to modify and, if possible, improve the Satania adaptation of the Nebadon life designs, and it is of record that we achieved numerous beneficial modifications of the standard life patterns. To be specific, on Urantia we worked out and have satisfactorily demonstrated not less than twenty-eight features of life modification which will be of service to all Nebadon throughout all future time.
	> 
	> “But the establishment of life on no world is ever experimental in the sense that something untried and unknown is attempted. The evolution of life is a technique ever progressive, differential, and variable, but never haphazard, uncontrolled, nor wholly experimental, in the accidental sense.” <a id="s652_298"></a>[UB 65:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_1)

2. Organic evolution is not a cosmic accident. Wound healing evidences mind planning.

	> “Many features of human life afford abundant evidence that the phenomenon of mortal existence was intelligently planned, that organic evolution is not a mere cosmic accident. When a living cell is injured, it possesses the ability to elaborate certain chemical substances which are empowered so to stimulate and activate the neighboring normal cells that they immediately begin the secretion of certain substances which facilitate healing processes in the wound; and at the same time these normal and uninjured cells begin to proliferate—they actually start to work creating new cells to replace any fellow cells which may have been destroyed by the accident.” <a id="s656_664"></a>[UB 65:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_3)

3. Urantia type of wound healing results from half a million experiments in developing a formula embracing one hundred thousand possible chemical reactions and biologic repercussions.

	> “This chemical action and reaction concerned in wound healing and cell reproduction represents the choice of the Life Carriers of a formula embracing over one hundred thousand phases and features of possible chemical reactions and biologic repercussions. More than half a million specific experiments were made by the Life Carriers in their laboratories before they finally settled upon this formula for the Urantia life experiment.” <a id="s660_437"></a>[UB 65:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_4)

4. Better understanding of healing chemicals will improve the treatment of certain diseases.

	> “When Urantia scientists know more of these healing chemicals, they will become more efficient in the treatment of injuries, and indirectly they will know more about controlling certain serious diseases.” <a id="s664_208"></a>[UB 65:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_5)

5. Urantia experience has resulted in the improvement of healing techniques.

	> “Since life was established on Urantia, the Life Carriers have improved this healing technique as it has been introduced on another Satania world, in that it affords more pain relief and exercises better control over the proliferation capacity of the associated normal cells.” <a id="s668_280"></a>[UB 65:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_6)

#### B. Unique features of Urantia experiment.

1. The Andonic race appeared before the six colored races and these six mutants simultaneously appeared in one family.

	> “There were many unique features of the Urantia life experiment, but the two outstanding episodes were the appearance of the Andonic race prior to the evolution of the six colored peoples and the later simultaneous appearance of the Sangik mutants in a single family. Urantia is the first world in Satania where the six colored races sprang from the same human family. They ordinarily arise in diversified strains from independent mutations within the prehuman animal stock and usually appear on earth one at a time and successively over long periods of time, beginning with the red man and passing on down through the colors to indigo.” <a id="s674_641"></a>[UB 65:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_7)

	> “It was our intention to produce an early manifestation of will in the evolutionary life of Urantia, and we succeeded. Ordinarily, will does not emerge until the colored races have long been in existence, usually first appearing among the superior types of the red man. Your world is the only planet in Satania where the human type of will has appeared in a precolored race.” <a id="s676_379"></a>[UB 65:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_11)

2. The Planetary Prince appeared five hundred thousand years later than on ordinary worlds.

	> “Another outstanding variation of procedure was the late arrival of the Planetary Prince. As a rule, the prince appears on a planet about the time of will development; and if such a plan had been followed, Caligastia might have come to Urantia even during the lifetimes of Andon and Fonta instead of almost five hundred thousand years later, simultaneously with the appearance of the six Sangik races.
	> 
	> “On an ordinary inhabited world a Planetary Prince would have been granted on the request of the Life Carriers at, or sometime after, the appearance of Andon and Fonta. But Urantia having been designated a life-modification planet, it was by preagreement that the Melchizedek observers, twelve in number, were sent as advisers to the Life Carriers and as overseers of the planet until the subsequent arrival of the Planetary Prince. These Melchizedeks came at the time Andon and Fonta made the decisions which enabled Thought Adjusters to indwell their mortal minds.” <a id="s682_571"></a>[UB 65:4.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_8)

3. Many useless forms of life were produced.

	> “On Urantia the endeavors of the Life Carriers to improve the Satania life patterns necessarily resulted in the production of many apparently useless forms of transition life. But the gains already accrued are sufficient to justify the Urantia modifications of the standard life designs.” <a id="s686_292"></a>[UB 65:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_10)

	> “But in our effort to provide for that combination and association of inheritance factors which finally gave rise to the mammalian ancestors of the human race, we were confronted with the necessity of permitting hundreds and thousands of other and comparatively useless combinations and associations of inheritance factors to take place. Many of these seemingly strange by-products of our efforts are certain to meet your gaze as you dig back into the planetary past, and I can well understand how puzzling some of these things must be to the limited human viewpoint.” <a id="s688_572"></a>[UB 65:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_12)

4. Man evolves from mammals derived from the western life implantation.

	> “Man thus evolved from the higher mammals derived principally from the _western implantation_ of life in the ancient east-west sheltered seas. The _eastern_ and _central groups_ of living organisms were early progressing favorably toward the attainment of prehuman levels of animal existence. But as the ages passed, the eastern focus of life emplacement failed to attain a satisfactory level of intelligent prehuman status, having suffered such repeated and irretrievable losses of its highest types of germ plasm that it was forever shorn of the power to rehabilitate human potentialities.” <a id="s692_596"></a>[UB 65:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_13)

### II. Evolution of Man on Nonexperimental Worlds

#### A. The six evolutionary races.

1. On inhabited worlds the red man usually appears first—soon followed by the other colored races.

	> “The race of dominance during the early ages of the inhabited worlds is the red man, who ordinarily is the first to attain human levels of development. But while the red man is the senior race of the planets, the succeeding colored peoples begin to make their appearances very early in the age of mortal emergence.
	> 
	> “The earlier races are somewhat superior to the later: the red man stands far above the indigo—black—race. The Life Carriers impart the full bestowal of the living energies to the initial or red race, and each succeeding evolutionary manifestation of a distinct group of mortals represents variation at the expense of the original endowment. Even mortal stature tends to decrease from the red man down to the indigo race, although on Urantia unexpected strains of giantism appeared among the green and orange peoples.” <a id="s702_522"></a>[UB 51:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_1)

2. The red, yellow, and blue races are the superior peoples among the colored races.

	> “On those worlds having all six evolutionary races the superior peoples are the first, third, and fifth races—the red, the yellow, and the blue. The evolutionary races thus alternate in capacity for intellectual growth and spiritual development, the second, fourth, and sixth being somewhat less endowed. These secondary races are the peoples that are missing on certain worlds; they are the ones that have been exterminated on many others. It is a misfortune on Urantia that you so largely lost your superior blue men, except as they persist in your amalgamated ‘white race.’ The loss of your orange and green stocks is not of such serious concern.” <a id="s706_654"></a>[UB 51:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_3)

3. Advantage of racial variety and the amalgamation of the colored races.

	> “The evolution of six—or of three—colored races, while seeming to deteriorate the original endowment of the red man, provides certain very desirable variations in mortal types and affords an otherwise unattainable expression of diverse human potentials. These modifications are beneficial to the progress of mankind as a whole provided they are subsequently upstepped by the imported Adamic or violet race. On Urantia this usual plan of amalgamation was not extensively carried out, and this failure to execute the plan of race evolution makes it impossible for you to understand very much about the status of these peoples on an average inhabited planet by observing the remnants of these early races on your world.
	> 
	> “In the early days of racial development there is a slight tendency for the red, the yellow, and the blue man to interbreed; there is a similar tendency for the orange, green, and indigo races to intermingle.” <a id="s712_213"></a>[UB 51:4.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_4)

4. Subjugation of the secondary races and the origin of slavery.

	> “The more backward humans are usually employed as laborers by the more progressive races. This accounts for the origin of slavery on the planets during the early ages. The orange men are usually subdued by the red and reduced to the status of servants—sometimes exterminated. The yellow and red men often fraternize, but not always. The yellow race usually enslaves the green, while the blue man subdues the indigo. These races of primitive men think no more of utilizing the services of their backward fellows in compulsory labor than Urantians would of buying and selling horses and cattle.” <a id="s716_597"></a>[UB 51:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_6)

5. On normal worlds slavery does not survive the dispensation of the Planetary Prince.

	> “On most normal worlds involuntary servitude does not survive the dispensation of the Planetary Prince, although mental defectives and social delinquents are often still compelled to perform involuntary labor. But on all normal spheres this sort of primitive slavery is abolished soon after the arrival of the imported violet or Adamic race.” <a id="s720_346"></a>[UB 51:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_7)

6. Problem of eliminating defective stocks before upstepping by the Adamic race.

	> “These six evolutionary races are destined to be blended and exalted by amalgamation with the progeny of the Adamic uplifters. But before these peoples are blended, the inferior and unfit are largely eliminated. The Planetary Prince and the Material Son, with other suitable planetary authorities, pass upon the fitness of the reproducing strains. The difficulty of executing such a radical program on Urantia consists in the absence of competent judges to pass upon the biologic fitness or unfitness of the individuals of your world races. Notwithstanding this obstacle, it seems that you ought to be able to agree upon the biologic disfellowshiping of your more markedly unfit, defective, degenerate, and antisocial stocks.” <a id="s724_730"></a>[UB 51:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_8)

#### B. General description of primitive man.

1. Order of appearance of the primitive colored races.

	> “From the time of man’s emergence from the animal level—when he can choose to worship the Creator—to the arrival of the Planetary Prince, mortal will creatures are called _primitive men._ There are six basic types or races of primitive men, and these early peoples successively appear in the order of the spectrum colors, beginning with the red. The length of time consumed in this early life evolution varies greatly on the different worlds, ranging from one hundred and fifty thousand years to over one million years of Urantia time.
	> 
	> “The evolutionary races of color—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo—begin to appear about the time that primitive man is developing a simple language and is beginning to exercise the creative imagination. By this time man is well accustomed to standing erect.” <a id="s732_274"></a>[UB 52:1.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_1)

2. Primitive men are hunters and fighters—it is the age of the survival of the fittest.

	> “Primitive men are mighty hunters and fierce fighters. The law of this age is the physical survival of the fittest; the government of these times is wholly tribal. During the early racial struggles on many worlds some of the evolutionary races are obliterated, as occurred on Urantia. Those who survive are usually subsequently blended with the later imported violet race, the Adamic peoples.” <a id="s736_397"></a>[UB 52:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_3)

3. The long struggle of primitive man will be more fully understood as man goes forward in the Paradise path.

	> “In the light of subsequent civilization, this era of primitive man is a long, dark, and bloody chapter. The ethics of the jungle and the morals of the primeval forests are not in keeping with the standards of later dispensations of revealed religion and higher spiritual development. On normal and nonexperimental worlds this epoch is very different from the prolonged and extraordinarily brutal struggles which characterized this age on Urantia. When you have emerged from your first world experience, you will begin to see why this long and painful struggle on the evolutionary worlds occurs, and as you go forward in the Paradise path, you will increasingly understand the wisdom of these apparently strange doings. But notwithstanding all the vicissitudes of the early ages of human emergence, the performances of primitive man represent a splendid, even a heroic, chapter in the annals of an evolutionary world of time and space.” <a id="s740_940"></a>[UB 52:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_4)

4. A view of early evolutionary man.

	> “Early evolutionary man is not a colorful creature. In general, these primitive mortals are cave dwellers or cliff residents. They also build crude huts in the large trees. Before they acquire a high order of intelligence, the planets are sometimes overrun with the larger types of animals. But early in this era mortals learn to kindle and maintain fire, and with the increase of inventive imagination and the improvement in tools, evolving man soon vanquishes the larger and more unwieldy animals. The early races also make extensive use of the larger flying animals. These enormous birds are able to carry one or two average-sized men for a nonstop flight of over five hundred miles. On some planets these birds are of great service since they possess a high order of intelligence, often being able to speak many words of the languages of the realm. These birds are most intelligent, very obedient, and unbelievably affectionate. Such passenger birds have been long extinct on Urantia, but your early ancestors enjoyed their services.” <a id="s744_1042"></a>[UB 52:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_5)

5. Arrival of the Planetary Prince.

	> “Within one hundred thousand years from the time man acquires erect posture, the Planetary Prince usually arrives, having been dispatched by the System Sovereign upon the report of the Life Carriers that will is functioning, even though comparatively few individuals have thus developed. Primitive mortals usually welcome the Planetary Prince and his visible staff; in fact, they often look upon them with awe and reverence, almost with worshipfulness, if they are not restrained.” <a id="s748_485"></a>[UB 52:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_8)

### III. **Evolution of the Colored Races on Urantia**

#### A. The Sangik family.

1. The Sangik family appears in one of the Badonan tribes.

	> “_500,000_ years ago the Badonan tribes of the northwestern highlands of India became involved in another great racial struggle. For more than one hundred years this relentless warfare raged, and when the long fight was finished, only about one hundred families were left. But these survivors were the most intelligent and desirable of all the then living descendants of Andon and Fonta.
	> 
	> “And now, among these highland Badonites there was a new and strange occurrence. A man and woman living in the northeastern part of the then inhabited highland region began _suddenly_ to produce a family of unusually intelligent children. This was the _Sangik family_, the ancestors of all of the six colored races of Urantia.” <a id="s758_331"></a>[UB 64:5.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5_1)

2. Nineteen colored children are born in this Sangik family.

	> “These Sangik children, nineteen in number, were not only intelligent above their fellows, but their skins manifested a unique tendency to turn various colors upon exposure to sunlight. Among these nineteen children were five red, two orange, four yellow, two green, four blue, and two indigo. These colors became more pronounced as the children grew older, and when these youths later mated with their fellow tribesmen, all of their offspring tended toward the skin color of the Sangik parent.
	> 
	> “And now I interrupt the chronological narrative, after calling attention to the arrival of the Planetary Prince at about this time, while we separately consider the six Sangik races of Urantia.” <a id="s764_199"></a>[UB 64:5.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5_3)

3. On an average world the colored races appear one at a time—the red man coming first. On no other world in Satania has a race evolved before the colored races.

	> “On an average evolutionary planet the six evolutionary races of color appear one by one; the red man is the first to evolve, and for ages he roams the world before the succeeding colored races make their appearance. The simultaneous emergence of all six races on Urantia, _and in one family_, was most unusual.”
	> 
	> “The appearance of the earlier Andonites on Urantia was also something new in Satania. On no other world in the local system has such a race of will creatures evolved in advance of the evolutionary races of color.<a id="s770_216"></a>[UB 64:6.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_1)

#### B. The six Sangik races of Urantia.

1. The story of the red man.

	> “1. _The red man_. These peoples were remarkable specimens of the human race, in many ways superior to Andon and Fonta. They were a most intelligent group and were the first of the Sangik children to develop a tribal civilization and government. They were always monogamous; even their mixed descendants seldom practiced plural mating.
	> 
	> “In later times they had serious and prolonged trouble with their yellow brethren in Asia. They were aided by their early invention of the bow and arrow, but they had unfortunately inherited much of the tendency of their ancestors to fight among themselves, and this so weakened them that the yellow tribes were able to drive them off the Asiatic continent.
	> 
	> “About eighty-five thousand years ago the comparatively pure remnants of the red race went en masse across to North America, and shortly thereafter the Bering land isthmus sank, thus isolating them. No red man ever returned to Asia. But throughout Siberia, China, central Asia, India, and Europe they left behind much of their stock blended with the other colored races.
	> 
	> “When the red man crossed over into America, he brought along much of the teachings and traditions of his early origin. His immediate ancestors had been in touch with the later activities of the world headquarters of the Planetary Prince. But in a short time after reaching the Americas, the red men began to lose sight of these teachings, and there occurred a great decline in intellectual and spiritual culture. Very soon these people again fell to fighting so fiercely among themselves that it appeared that these tribal wars would result in the speedy extinction of this remnant of the comparatively pure red race.
	> 
	> “Because of this great retrogression the red men seemed doomed when, about sixty-five thousand years ago, Onamonalonton appeared as their leader and spiritual deliverer. He brought temporary peace among the American red men and revived their worship of the ‘Great Spirit.’ Onamonalonton lived to be ninety-six years of age and maintained his headquarters among the great redwood trees of California. Many of his later descendants have come down to modern times among the Blackfoot Indians.
	> 
	> “As time passed, the teachings of Onamonalonton became hazy traditions. Internecine wars were resumed, and never after the days of this great teacher did another leader succeed in bringing universal peace among them. Increasingly the more intelligent strains perished in these tribal struggles; otherwise a great civilization would have been built upon the North American continent by these able and intelligent red men.
	> 
	> “After crossing over to America from China, the northern red man never again came in contact with other world influences (except the Eskimo) until he was later discovered by the white man. It was most unfortunate that the red man almost completely missed his opportunity of being upstepped by the admixture of the later Adamic stock. As it was, the red man could not rule the white man, and he would not willingly serve him. In such a circumstance, if the two races do not blend, one or the other is doomed.” <a id="s788_512"></a>[UB 64:6.3-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_3)

2. The story of the orange man.

	> “2. _The orange man_. The outstanding characteristic of this race was their peculiar urge to build, to build anything and everything, even to the piling up of vast mounds of stone just to see which tribe could build the largest mound. Though they were not a progressive people, they profited much from the schools of the Prince and sent delegates there for instruction.
	> 
	> “The orange race was the first to follow the coast line southward toward Africa as the Mediterranean Sea withdrew to the west. But they never secured a favorable footing in Africa and were wiped out of existence by the later arriving green race.
	> 
	> “Before the end came, this people lost much cultural and spiritual ground. But there was a great revival of higher living as a result of the wise leadership of _Porshunta,_ the master mind of this unfortunate race, who ministered to them when their headquarters was at Armageddon some three hundred thousand years ago.
	> 
	> “The last great struggle between the orange and the green men occurred in the region of the lower Nile valley in Egypt. This long-drawn-out battle was waged for almost one hundred years, and at its close very few of the orange race were left alive. The shattered remnants of these people were absorbed by the green and by the later arriving indigo men. But as a race the orange man ceased to exist about one hundred thousand years ago.” <a id="s798_440"></a>[UB 64:6.10-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_10)

3. The story of the yellow man.

	> “3. _The yellow man_. The primitive yellow tribes were the first to abandon the chase, establish settled communities, and develop a home life based on agriculture. Intellectually they were somewhat inferior to the red man, but socially and collectively they proved themselves superior to all of the Sangik peoples in the matter of fostering racial civilization. Because they developed a fraternal spirit, the various tribes learning to live together in relative peace, they were able to drive the red race before them as they gradually expanded into Asia.
	> 
	> “They traveled far from the influences of the spiritual headquarters of the world and drifted into great darkness following the Caligastia apostasy; but there occurred one brilliant age among this people when Singlangton, about one hundred thousand years ago, assumed the leadership of these tribes and proclaimed the worship of the ‘One Truth.’
	> 
	> “The survival of comparatively large numbers of the yellow race is due to their intertribal peacefulness. From the days of Singlangton to the times of modern China, the yellow race has been numbered among the more peaceful of the nations of Urantia. This race received a small but potent legacy of the later imported Adamic stock.” <a id="s806_335"></a>[UB 64:6.14-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_14)

4. The story of the green man.

	> “4. _The green man_. The green race was one of the less able groups of primitive men, and they were greatly weakened by extensive migrations in different directions. Before their dispersion these tribes experienced a great revival of culture under the leadership of Fantad, some three hundred and fifty thousand years ago.
	> 
	> “The green race split into three major divisions: The northern tribes were subdued, enslaved, and absorbed by the yellow and blue races. The eastern group were amalgamated with the Indian peoples of those days, and remnants still persist among them. The southern nation entered Africa, where they destroyed their almost equally inferior orange cousins.
	> 
	> “In many ways both groups were evenly matched in this struggle since each carried strains of the giant order, many of their leaders being eight and nine feet in height. These giant strains of the green man were mostly confined to this southern or Egyptian nation.
	> 
	> “The remnants of the victorious green men were subsequently absorbed by the indigo race, the last of the colored peoples to develop and emigrate from the original Sangik center of race dispersion.” <a id="s816_201"></a>[UB 64:6.17-20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_17)

5. The story of the blue man.

	> “5. _The blue man_. The blue men were a great people. They early invented the spear and subsequently worked out the rudiments of many of the arts of modern civilization. The blue man had the brain power of the red man associated with the soul and sentiment of the yellow man. The Adamic descendants preferred them to all of the later persisting colored races.
	> 
	> “The early blue men were responsive to the persuasions of the teachers of Prince Caligastia’s staff and were thrown into great confusion by the subsequent perverted teachings of those traitorous leaders. Like other primitive races they never fully recovered from the turmoil produced by the Caligastia betrayal, nor did they ever completely overcome their tendency to fight among themselves.
	> 
	> “About five hundred years after Caligastia’s downfall a widespread revival of learning and religion of a primitive sort—but none the less real and beneficial—occurred. Orlandof became a great teacher among the blue race and led many of the tribes back to the worship of the true God under the name of the “Supreme Chief.” This was the greatest advance of the blue man until those later times when this race was so greatly upstepped by the admixture of the Adamic stock.
	> 
	> “The European researches and explorations of the Old Stone Age have largely to do with unearthing the tools, bones, and artcraft of these ancient blue men, for they persisted in Europe until recent times. The so-called _white races_ of Urantia are the descendants of these blue men as they were first modified by slight mixture with yellow and red, and as they were later greatly upstepped by assimilating the greater portion of the violet race.” <a id="s826_450"></a>[UB 64:6.21-24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_21)

6. The story of the indigo race.

	> “6. _The indigo race._ As the red men were the most advanced of all the Sangik peoples, so the black men were the least progressive. They were the last to migrate from their highland homes. They journeyed to Africa, taking possession of the continent, and have ever since remained there except when they have been forcibly taken away, from age to age, as slaves.
	> 
	> “Isolated in Africa, the indigo peoples, like the red man, received little or none of the race elevation which would have been derived from the infusion of the Adamic stock. Alone in Africa, the indigo race made little advancement until the days of Orvonon, when they experienced a great spiritual awakening. While they later almost entirely forgot the “God of Gods” proclaimed by Orvonon, they did not entirely lose the desire to worship the Unknown; at least they maintained a form of worship up to a few thousand years ago.
	> 
	> “Notwithstanding their backwardness, these indigo peoples have exactly the same standing before the celestial powers as any other earthly race.” <a id="s834_148"></a>[UB 64:6.25-27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_25)

7. There are at least five reasons for evolving different colored races.

	> “There are many good and sufficient reasons for the plan of evolving either three or six colored races on the worlds of space. “Though Urantia mortals may not be in a position fully to appreciate all of these reasons, we would call attention to the following:
	> “1. Variety is indispensable to opportunity for the wide functioning of natural selection, differential survival of superior strains.
	> “2. Stronger and better races are to be had from the interbreeding of diverse peoples when these different races are carriers of superior inheritance factors. And the Urantia races would have benefited by such an early amalgamation provided such a conjoint people could have been subsequently effectively upstepped by a thoroughgoing admixture with the superior Adamic stock. The attempt to execute such an experiment on Urantia under present racial conditions would be highly disastrous.
	> “3. Competition is healthfully stimulated by diversification of races.
	> “4. Differences in status of the races and of groups within each race are essential to the development of human tolerance and altruism.
	> “5. Homogeneity of the human race is not desirable until the peoples of an evolving world attain comparatively high levels of spiritual development.” <a id="s843_153"></a>[UB 64:6.30-35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_30)

#### C. Dispersion of the colored races.

1. Natural conditions prevented extensive dispersion for one hundred thousand years.

	> “When the colored descendants of the Sangik family began to multiply, and as they sought opportunity for expansion into adjacent territory, the fifth glacier, the third of geologic count, was well advanced on its southern drift over Europe and Asia. These early colored races were extraordinarily tested by the rigors and hardships of the glacial age of their origin. This glacier was so extensive in Asia that for thousands of years migration to eastern Asia was cut off. And not until the later retreat of the Mediterranean Sea, consequent upon the elevation of Arabia, was it possible for them to reach Africa.
	> 
	> “Thus it was that for almost one hundred thousand years these Sangik peoples spread out around the foothills and mingled together more or less, notwithstanding the peculiar but natural antipathy which early manifested itself between the different races.” <a id="s851_258"></a>[UB 64:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_1)

2. Migrations of the red, yellow, and blue men and the “melting pot” of India.

	> “Between the times of the Planetary Prince and Adam, India became the home of the most cosmopolitan population ever to be found on the face of the earth. But it was unfortunate that this mixture came to contain so much of the green, orange, and indigo races. These secondary Sangik peoples found existence more easy and agreeable in the southlands, and many of them subsequently migrated to Africa. The primary Sangik peoples, the superior races, avoided the tropics, the red man going northeast to Asia, closely followed by the yellow man, while the blue race moved northwest into Europe.” <a id="s855_594"></a>[UB 64:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_3)

3. The red man enters North America

	> “The red men early began to migrate to the northeast, on the heels of the retreating ice, passing around the highlands of India and occupying all of northeastern Asia. They were closely followed by the yellow tribes, who subsequently drove them out of Asia into North America.” <a id="s859_281"></a>[UB 64:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_4)

4. Mongrel red races establish the civilizations of Mexico, Central America, and South America.

	> “When the relatively pure-line remnants of the red race forsook Asia, there were eleven tribes, and they numbered a little over seven thousand men, women, and children. These tribes were accompanied by three small groups of mixed ancestry, the largest of these being a combination of the orange and blue races. These three groups never fully fraternized with the red man and early journeyed southward to Mexico and Central America, where they were later joined by a small group of mixed yellows and reds. These peoples all intermarried and founded a new and amalgamated race, one which was much less warlike than the pure-line red men. Within five thousand years this amalgamated race broke up into three groups, establishing the civilizations respectively of Mexico, Central America, and South America. The South American offshoot did receive a faint touch of the blood of Adam.” <a id="s863_884"></a>[UB 64:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_5)

5. The brown races were derived from a mixture of the red and yellow peoples.

	> “To a certain extent the early red and yellow men mingled in Asia, and the offspring of this union journeyed on to the east and along the southern seacoast and, eventually, were driven by the rapidly increasing yellow race onto the peninsulas and near-by islands of the sea. They are the present-day brown men.” <a id="s867_315"></a>[UB 64:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_6)

6. The yellow races survived in Asia. The red, green, and orange races almost destroyed themselves by racial wars.

	> “The yellow race has continued to occupy the central regions of eastern Asia. Of all the six colored races they have survived in greatest numbers. While the yellow men now and then engaged in racial war, they did not carry on such incessant and relentless wars of extermination as were waged by the red, green, and orange men. These three races virtually destroyed themselves before they were finally all but annihilated by their enemies of other races.” <a id="s871_458"></a>[UB 64:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_7)

7. As Sangik tribes, particularly the blue men, invaded Europe they mingled with and upstepped the Neanderthalers, who subsequently were extended from England to India.

	> “Since the fifth glacier did not extend so far south in Europe, the way was partially open for these Sangik peoples to migrate to the northwest; and upon the retreat of the ice the blue men, together with a few other small racial groups, migrated westward along the old trails of the Andon tribes. They invaded Europe in successive waves, occupying most of the continent.
	> 
	> “In Europe they soon encountered the Neanderthal descendants of their early and common ancestor, Andon. These older European Neanderthalers had been driven south and east by the glacier and thus were in position quickly to encounter and absorb their invading cousins of the Sangik tribes.
	> 
	> “In general and to start with, the Sangik tribes were more intelligent than, and in most ways far superior to, the deteriorated descendants of the early Andonic plainsmen; and the mingling of these Sangik tribes with the Neanderthal peoples led to the immediate improvement of the older race. It was this infusion of Sangik blood, more especially that of the blue man, which produced that marked improvement in the Neanderthal peoples exhibited by the successive waves of increasingly intelligent tribes that swept over Europe from the east.
	> 
	> “During the following interglacial period this new Neanderthal race extended from England to India. The remnant of the blue race left in the old Persian peninsula later amalgamated with certain others, primarily the yellow; and the resultant blend, subsequently somewhat upstepped by the violet race of Adam, has persisted as the swarthy nomadic tribes of modern Arabs.” <a id="s881_374"></a>[UB 64:7.8-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_8)

8. The ultimate destiny of the Sangik tribes must take into account the later admixture of Adamic blood.

	> “All efforts to identify the Sangik ancestry of modern peoples must take into account the later improvement of the racial strains by the subsequent admixture of Adamic blood.” <a id="s885_179"></a>[UB 64:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_12)

9. The primary Sangiks sought the temperate climes while the secondary moved southward.

	> “The superior races sought the northern or temperate climes, while the orange, green, and indigo races successively gravitated to Africa over the newly elevated land bridge which separated the westward retreating Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean.” <a id="s889_254"></a>[UB 64:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_13)

10. The mass migration of the indigo peoples into Africa.

	> “The last of the Sangik peoples to migrate from their center of race origin was the indigo man. About the time the green man was killing off the orange race in Egypt and greatly weakening himself in so doing, the great black exodus started south through Palestine along the coast; and later, when these physically strong indigo peoples overran Egypt, they wiped the green man out of existence by sheer force of numbers. These indigo races absorbed the remnants of the orange man and much of the stock of the green man, and certain of the indigo tribes were considerably improved by this racial amalgamation.” <a id="s893_612"></a>[UB 64:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_14)

11. The racial history of early Egypt.

	> “And so it appears that Egypt was first dominated by the orange man, then by the green, followed by the indigo (black) man, and still later by a mongrel race of indigo, blue, and modified green men. But long before Adam arrived, the blue men of Europe and the mixed races of Arabia had driven the indigo race out of Egypt and far south on the African continent.” <a id="s897_366"></a>[UB 64:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_15)

12. Distribution of the colored races at the end of the Sangik migrations.

	> “As the Sangik migrations draw to a close, the green and orange races are gone, the red man holds North America, the yellow man eastern Asia, the blue man Europe, and the indigo race has gravitated to Africa. India harbors a blend of the secondary Sangik races, and the brown man, a blend of the red and yellow, holds the islands off the Asiatic coast. An amalgamated race of rather superior potential occupies the highlands of South America. The purer Andonites live in the extreme northern regions of Europe and in Iceland, Greenland, and northeastern North America.” <a id="s901_573"></a>[UB 64:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_16)

13. Fear of glaciers produced the first marine adventurers.

	> “During the periods of farthest glacial advance the westernmost of the Andon tribes came very near being driven into the sea. They lived for years on a narrow southern strip of the present island of England. And it was the tradition of these repeated glacial advances that drove them to take to the sea when the sixth and last glacier finally appeared. They were the first marine adventurers. They built boats and started in search of new lands which they hoped might be free from the terrifying ice invasions. And some of them reached Iceland, others Greenland, but the vast majority perished from hunger and thirst on the open sea.” <a id="s905_638"></a>[UB 64:7.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_17)

14. Arrival of the red man and the Eskimos in North America.

	> “A little more than eighty thousand years ago, shortly after the red man entered northwestern North America, the freezing over of the north seas and the advance of local ice fields on Greenland drove these Eskimo descendants of the Urantia aborigines to seek a better land, a new home; and they were successful, safely crossing the narrow straits which then separated Greenland from the northeastern land masses of North America. They reached the continent about twenty-one hundred years after the red man arrived in Alaska. Subsequently some of the mixed stock of the blue man journeyed westward and amalgamated with the later-day Eskimos, and this union was slightly beneficial to the Eskimo tribes.” <a id="s909_706"></a>[UB 64:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_18)

15. The courage and devotion of early man often bordered on grandeur and sublimity.

	> “The struggles of these early ages were characterized by courage, bravery, and even heroism. And we all regret that so many of those sterling and rugged traits of your early ancestors have been lost to the later-day races. While we appreciate the value of many of the refinements of advancing civilization, we miss the magnificent persistency and superb devotion of your early ancestors, which oftentimes bordered on grandeur and sublimity.” <a id="s913_445"></a>[UB 64:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_20)

#### D. Secondary Sangik races in Africa.

1. Climatic and geologic changes caused the dwellers of Sahara to disperse.

	> “The early expansion of the violet race into Europe was cut short by certain rather sudden climatic and geologic changes. With the retreat of the northern ice fields the water-laden winds from the west shifted to the north, gradually turning the great open pasture regions of Sahara into a barren desert. This drought dispersed the smaller-statured brunets, dark-eyed but long-headed dwellers of the great Sahara plateau.
	> 
	> “The purer indigo elements moved southward to the forests of central Africa, where they have ever since remained. The more mixed groups spread out in three directions: The superior tribes to the west migrated to Spain and thence to adjacent parts of Europe, forming the nucleus of the later Mediterranean long-headed brunet races. The least progressive division to the east of the Sahara plateau migrated to Arabia and thence through northern Mesopotamia and India to faraway Ceylon. The central group moved north and east to the Nile valley and into Palestine.
	> 
	> “It is this secondary Sangik substratum that suggests a certain degree of kinship among the modern peoples scattered from the Deccan through Iran, Mesopotamia, and along both shores of the Mediterranean Sea.” <a id="s923_212"></a>[UB 80:2.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_1)

#### E. The red man and yellow man.

1. The red man and yellow man escaped admixture with the Neanderthalers. The red man reigned supreme in eastern Asia until population pressure caused the yellow race to move northward. Warfare resulted and after two hundred thousand years the red man was driven across the Bering isthmus into North America.

	> “While the story of India is that of Andite conquest and eventual submergence in the older evolutionary peoples, the narrative of eastern Asia is more properly that of the primary Sangiks, particularly the red man and the yellow man. These two races largely escaped that admixture with the debased Neanderthal strain which so greatly retarded the blue man in Europe, thus preserving the superior potential of the primary Sangik type.
	> 
	> “While the early Neanderthalers were spread out over the entire breadth of Eurasia, the eastern wing was the more contaminated with debased animal strains. These subhuman types were pushed south by the fifth glacier, the same ice sheet which so long blocked Sangik migration into eastern Asia. And when the red man moved northeast around the highlands of India, he found northeastern Asia free from these subhuman types. The tribal organization of the red races was formed earlier than that of any other peoples, and they were the first to migrate from the central Asian focus of the Sangiks. The inferior Neanderthal strains were destroyed or driven off the mainland by the later migrating yellow tribes. But the red man had reigned supreme in eastern Asia for almost one hundred thousand years before the yellow tribes arrived.
	> 
	> “More than three hundred thousand years ago the main body of the yellow race entered China from the south as coastwise migrants. Each millennium they penetrated farther and farther inland, but they did not make contact with their migrating Tibetan brethren until comparatively recent times.
	> 
	> “Growing population pressure caused the northward-moving yellow race to begin to push into the hunting grounds of the red man. This encroachment, coupled with natural racial antagonism, culminated in increasing hostilities, and thus began the crucial struggle for the fertile lands of farther Asia.
	> 
	> “The story of this agelong contest between the red and yellow races is an epic of Urantia history. For over two hundred thousand years these two superior races waged bitter and unremitting warfare. In the earlier struggles the red men were generally successful, their raiding parties spreading havoc among the yellow settlements. But the yellow man was an apt pupil in the art of warfare, and he early manifested a marked ability to live peaceably with his compatriots; the Chinese were the first to learn that in union there is strength. The red tribes continued their internecine conflicts, and presently they began to suffer repeated defeats at the aggressive hands of the relentless Chinese, who continued their inexorable march northward.
	> 
	> “One hundred thousand years ago the decimated tribes of the red race were fighting with their backs to the retreating ice of the last glacier, and when the land passage to the west, over the Bering isthmus, became passable, these tribes were not slow in forsaking the inhospitable shores of the Asiatic continent. It is eighty-five thousand years since the last of the pure red men departed from Asia, but the long struggle left its genetic imprint upon the victorious yellow race. The northern Chinese peoples, together with the Andonite Siberians, assimilated much of the red stock and were in considerable measure benefited thereby.” <a id="s939_640"></a>[UB 79:5.1-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p5_1)

2. The North American Indians never came in contact with the descendants of Adam and Eve since the last to migrate to North America arrived 85,000 years ago.

	> “The North American Indians never came in contact with even the Andite offspring of Adam and Eve, having been dispossessed of their Asiatic homelands some fifty thousand years before the coming of Adam. During the age of Andite migrations the pure red strains were spreading out over North America as nomadic tribes, hunters who practiced agriculture to a small extent. These races and cultural groups remained almost completely isolated from the remainder of the world from their arrival in the Americas down to the end of the first millennium of the Christian era, when they were discovered by the white races of Europe. Up to that time the Eskimos were the nearest to white men the northern tribes of red men had ever seen.
	> 
	> “The red and the yellow races are the only human stocks that ever achieved a high degree of civilization apart from the influences of the Andites. The oldest Amerindian culture was the Onamonalonton center in California, but this had long since vanished by 35,000 B.C. In Mexico, Central America, and in the mountains of South America the later and more enduring civilizations were founded by a race predominantly red but containing a considerable admixture of the yellow, orange, and blue.” <a id="s945_495"></a>[UB 79:5.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p5_7)

3. Movement of races in southeastern Asia.

	> “Sometime after driving the red man across to North America, the expanding Chinese cleared the Andonites from the river valleys of eastern Asia, pushing them north into Siberia and west into Turkestan, where they were soon to come in contact with the superior culture of the Andites.
	> 
	> “In Burma and the peninsula of Indo-China the cultures of India and China mixed and blended to produce the successive civilizations of those regions. Here the vanished green race has persisted in larger proportion than anywhere else in the world.
	> 
	> “Many different races occupied the islands of the Pacific. In general, the southern and then more extensive islands were occupied by peoples carrying a heavy percentage of green and indigo blood. The northern islands were held by Andonites and, later on, by races embracing large proportions of the yellow and red stocks. The ancestors of the Japanese people were not driven off the mainland until 12,000 B.C., when they were dislodged by a powerful southern-coastwise thrust of the northern Chinese tribes. Their final exodus was not so much due to population pressure as to the initiative of a chieftain whom they came to regard as a divine personage.
	> 
	> “Like the peoples of India and the Levant, victorious tribes of the yellow man established their earliest centers along the coast and up the rivers. The coastal settlements fared poorly in later years as the increasing floods and the shifting courses of the rivers made the lowland cities untenable.
	> 
	> “Twenty thousand years ago the ancestors of the Chinese had built up a dozen strong centers of primitive culture and learning, especially along the Yellow River and the Yangtze. And now these centers began to be reinforced by the arrival of a steady stream of superior blended peoples from Sinkiang and Tibet. The migration from Tibet to the Yangtze valley was not so extensive as in the north, neither were the Tibetan centers so advanced as those of the Tarim basin. But both movements carried a certain amount of Andite blood eastward to the river settlements.” <a id="s957_568"></a>[UB 79:6.1-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p6_1)

#### F. The Cro-Magnoid blue man.

1. The ancient centers of blue man culture were located along the rivers of Europe.

	> “The ancient centers of the culture of the blue man were located along all the rivers of Europe, but only the Somme now flows in the same channel which it followed during preglacial times.” <a id="s963_193"></a>[UB 80:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_1)

2. The European culture of the blue man was a blend of many races.

	> “While we speak of the blue man as pervading the European continent, there were scores of racial types. Even thirty-five thousand years ago the European blue races were already a highly blended people carrying strains of both red and yellow, while on the Atlantic coastlands and in the regions of present-day Russia they had absorbed a considerable amount of Andonite blood and to the south were in contact with the Saharan peoples. But it would be fruitless to attempt to enumerate the many racial groups.” <a id="s967_511"></a>[UB 80:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_2)

3. The post-Adamic culture of the Cro-Magnoids was a blend of the blue man and the Adamites.

	> “The European civilization of this early post-Adamic period was a unique blend of the vigor and art of the blue men with the creative imagination of the Adamites. The blue men were a race of great vigor, but they greatly deteriorated the cultural and spiritual status of the Adamites. It was very difficult for the latter to impress their religion upon the Cro-Magnoids because of the tendency of so many to cheat and to debauch the maidens. For ten thousand years religion in Europe was at a low ebb as compared with the developments in India and Egypt.” <a id="s971_559"></a>[UB 80:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_3)

4. The culture and civilization of the blue man.

	> “The blue men were perfectly honest in all their dealings and were wholly free from the sexual vices of the mixed Adamites. They respected maidenhood, only practicing polygamy when war produced a shortage of males.
	> 
	> “These Cro-Magnon peoples were a brave and farseeing race. They maintained an efficient system of child culture. Both parents participated in these labors, and the services of the older children were fully utilized. Each child was carefully trained in the care of the caves, in art, and in flint making. At an early age the women were well versed in the domestic arts and in crude agriculture, while the men were skilled hunters and courageous warriors.
	> 
	> “The blue men were hunters, fishers, and food gatherers; they were expert boatbuilders. They made stone axes, cut down trees, erected log huts, partly below ground and roofed with hides. And there are peoples who still build similar huts in Siberia. The southern Cro-Magnons generally lived in caves and grottoes.” <a id="s979_318"></a>[UB 80:3.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_4)

5. The Cro-Magnons were courageous; later, with the infusion of Adamic blood, they became artistic.

	> “It was not uncommon during the rigors of winter for their sentinels standing on night guard at cave entrances to freeze to death. They had courage, but above all they were artists; the Adamic mixture suddenly accelerated creative imagination. The height of the blue man’s art was about fifteen thousand years ago, before the days when the darker-skinned races came north from Africa through Spain.” <a id="s983_403"></a>[UB 80:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_7)

6. Climatic changes resulted in cultural advances, but caused certain biologic retrogressions.

	> “About fifteen thousand years ago the Alpine forests were spreading extensively. The European hunters were being driven to the river valleys and to the seashores by the same climatic coercion that had turned the world’s happy hunting grounds into dry and barren deserts. As the rain winds shifted to the north, the great open grazing lands of Europe became covered by forests. These great and relatively sudden climatic modifications drove the races of Europe to change from open-space hunters to herders, and in some measure to fishers and tillers of the soil.
	> 
	> “These changes, while resulting in cultural advances, produced certain biologic retrogressions. Duriìng the previous hunting era the superior tribes had intermarried with the higher types of war captives and had unvaryingly destroyed those whom they deemed inferior. But as they commenced to establish settlements and engage in agriculture and commerce, they began to save many of the mediocre captives as slaves. And it was the progeny of these slaves that subsequently so greatly deteriorated the whole CroMagnon type. This retrogression of culture continued until it received a fresh impetus from the east when the final and en masse invasion of the Mesopotamians swept over Europe, quickly absorbing the Cro-Magnon type and culture and initiating the civilization of the white races.” <a id="s989_792"></a>[UB 80:3.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_8)

## SECTION 5. SECOND AND THIRD PLANETARY MORTAL EPOCHS

### I. **The Planetary Prince Dispensation**

#### A. Post-Planetary Prince man on a normal planet.

1. Description of advances made during Planetary Prince dispensation.

	> “With the arrival of the Planetary Prince a new dispensation begins. Government appears on earth, and the advanced tribal epoch is attained. Great social strides are made during a few thousand years of this regime. Under normal conditions mortals attain a high state of civilization during this age. They do not struggle so long in barbarism as did the Urantia races. But life on an inhabited world is so changed by rebellion that you can have little or no idea of such a regime on a normal planet.
	> 
	> “The average length of this dispensation is around five hundred thousand years, some longer, some shorter. During this era the planet is established in the circuits of the system, and a full quota of seraphic and other celestial helpers is assigned to its administration. The Thought Adjusters come in increasing numbers, and the seraphic guardians amplify their regime of mortal supervision.
	> 
	> “When the Planetary Prince arrives on a primitive world, the evolved religion of fear and ignorance prevails. The prince and his staff make the first revelations of higher truth and universe organization. These initial presentations of revealed religion are very simple, and they usually pertain to the affairs of the local system. Religion is wholly an evolutionary process prior to the arrival of the Planetary Prince. Subsequently, religion progresses by graduated revelation as well as by evolutionary growth. Each dispensation, each mortal epoch, receives an enlarged presentation of spiritual truth and religious ethics. The evolution of the religious capacity of receptivity in the inhabitants of a world largely determines their rate of spiritual advancement and the extent of religious revelation.” <a id="s1003_811"></a>[UB 52:2.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_1)

2. Wars continue, but national life begins to replace tribal organization, and there is an emergence of family life.

	> “But the Planetary Prince is not ‘the Prince of Peace.’ Racial struggles and tribal wars continue over into this dispensation but with diminishing frequency and severity. This is the great age of racial dispersion, and it culminates in a period of intense nationalism. Color is the basis of tribal and national groupings, and the different races often develop separate languages. Each expanding group of mortals tends to seek isolation. This segregation is favored by the existence of many languages. Before the unification of the several races their relentless warfare sometimes results in the obliteration of whole peoples; the orange and green men are particularly subject to such extinction.
	> 
	> “On average worlds, during the latter part of the prince’s rule, national life begins to replace tribal organization or rather to be superimposed upon the existing tribal groupings. But the great social achievement of the prince’s epoch is the emergence of family life. Heretofore, human relationships have been chiefly tribal; now, the home begins to materialize.
	> 
	> “This is the dispensation of the realization of sex equality. On some planets the male may rule the female; on others the reverse prevails. During this age normal worlds establish full equality of the sexes, this being preliminary to the fuller realization of the ideals of home life. This is the dawn of the golden age of the home. The idea of tribal rule gradually gives way to the dual concept of national life and family life.
	> 
	> “During this age agriculture makes its appearance. The growth of the family idea is incompatible with the roving and unsettled life of the hunter. Gradually the practices of settled habitations and the cultivation of the soil become established. The domestication of animals and the development of home arts proceed space. Upon reaching the apex of biologic evolution, a high level of civilization has been attained, but there is little development of a mechanical order; invention is the characteristic of the succeeding age.” <a id="s1013_531"></a>[UB 52:2.5-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_5)

3. The beginning of race purification is one of the great achievements of this age.

	> “One of the great achievements of the age of the prince is this restriction of the multiplication of mentally defective and socially unfit individuals. Long before the times of the arrival of the second Sons, the Adams, most worlds seriously address themselves to the tasks of race purification, something which the Urantia peoples have not even yet seriously undertaken.” <a id="s1017_376"></a>[UB 52:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_10)

4. When primitive man attains the height of evolutionary development the biologic uplifters arrive—Adam and Eve.

	> “During the dispensation of a Planetary Prince, primitive man reaches the limit of natural evolutionary development, and this biologic attainment signals the System Sovereign to dispatch to such a world the second order of sonship, the biologic uplifters. These Sons, for there are two of them—the Material Son and Daughter—are usually known on a planet as Adam and Eve. The original Material Son of Satania is Adam, and those who go to the system worlds as biologic uplifters always carry the name of this first and original Son of their unique order.” <a id="s1021_557"></a>[UB 51:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p0_1)

#### B. Staff of the Planetary Prince on Urantia.

1. The Prince’s corporeal staff of one hundred.

	> “The planetary staff included a large number of angelic co-operators and a host of other celestial beings assigned to advance the interests and promote the welfare of the human races. But from your standpoint the most interesting group of all were the corporeal members of the Prince’s staff—sometimes referred to as _the Caligastia one hundred_.
	> 
	> “These one hundred rematerialized members of the Prince’s staff were chosen by Caligastia from over 785,000 ascendant citizens of Jerusem who volunteered for embarkation on the Urantia adventure. Each one of the chosen one hundred was from a different planet, and none of them were from Urantia.
	> 
	> “These Jerusemite volunteers were brought by seraphic transport direct from the system capital to Urantia, and upon arrival they were held enseraphimed until they could be provided with personality forms of the dual nature of special planetary service, literal bodies consisting of flesh and blood but also attuned to the life circuits of the system.” <a id="s1031_355"></a>[UB 66:2.3-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_3)

2. Implantation of the life plasm of one hundred Urantia humans into the new bodies of the Prince’s staff.

	> “Sometime before the arrival of these one hundred Jerusem citizens, the two supervising Life Carriers resident on Urantia, having previously perfected their plans, petitioned Jerusem and Edentia for permission to transplant the life plasm of one hundred selected survivors of the Andon and Fonta stock into the material bodies to be projected for the corporeal members of the Prince’s staff. The request was granted on Jerusem and approved on Edentia.
	> 
	> “Accordingly, fifty males and fifty females of the Andon and Fonta posterity, representing the survival of the best strains of that unique race, were chosen by the Life Carriers. With one or two exceptions these Andonite contributors to the advancement of the race were strangers to one another. They were assembled from widely separated places by co-ordinated Thought Adjuster direction and seraphic guidance at the threshold of the planetary headquarters of the Prince. Here the one hundred human subjects were given into the hands of the highly skilled volunteer commission from Avalon, who directed the material extraction of a portion of the life plasm of these Andon descendants. This living material was then transferred to the material bodies constructed for the use of the one hundred Jerusemite members of the Prince’s staff. Meantime, these newly arrived citizens of the system capital were held in the sleep of seraphic transport.” <a id="s1037_947"></a>[UB 66:2.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_6)

3. These transactions covered ten days and gave rise to numerous myths and legends.

	> “These transactions, together with the literal creation of special bodies for the Caligastia one hundred, gave origin to numerous legends, many of which subsequently became confused with the later traditions concerning the planetary installation of Adam and Eve.
	> 
	> “The entire transaction of repersonalization, from the time of the arrival of the seraphic transports bearing the one hundred Jerusem volunteers until they became conscious, threefold beings of the realm, consumed exactly ten days.” <a id="s1043_236"></a>[UB 66:2.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_8)

4. There were no offspring of the Prince’s corporeal staff before isolation of the Satania life currents. The staff followed the Andonic race in skin color and language.

	> “These special beings therefore had little or no idea as to what type of material creature would be produced by their sexual union. And they never did know; before the time for such a step in the prosecution of their world work the entire regime was upset by rebellion, and those who later functioned in the parental role had been isolated from the life currents of the system.
	> 
	> “In skin color and language these materialized members of Caligastia’s staff followed the Andonic race. They partook of food as did the mortals of the realm with this difference: The recreated bodies of this group were fully satisfied by a nonflesh diet. This was one of the considerations which determined their residence in a warm region abounding in fruits and nuts. The practice of subsisting on a nonflesh diet dates from the times of the Caligastia one hundred, for this custom spread near and far to affect the eating habits of many surrounding tribes, groups of origin in the once exclusively meat-eating evolutionary races.” <a id="s1049_637"></a>[UB 66:4.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_6)

5. Certain changes were also made in the bodies of the one hundred Andonites.

	> “It should be explained in this connection that, at the time the one hundred Andonites contributed their human germ plasm to the members of the Prince’s staff, the Life Carriers introduced into their mortal bodies the complement of the system circuits; and thus were they enabled to live on concurrently with the staff, century after century, in defiance of physical death.
	> 
	> “Eventually the one hundred Andonites were made aware of their contribution to the new forms of their superiors, and these same one hundred children of the Andon tribes were kept at headquarters as the personal attendants of the Prince’s corporeal staff.” <a id="s1055_259"></a>[UB 66:4.15-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_15)

6. Nature and function of the Prince’s corporeal staff.

	> “2. The one hundred were material but superhuman beings, having been reconstituted on Urantia as unique men and women of a high and special order.
	> 
	> “This group, while enjoying provisional citizenship on Jerusem, volunteered and were accepted for planetary service in liaison with the descending orders of sonship, their Adjusters were detached. But these Jerusemites were superhuman beings—they possessed souls of ascendant growth. During the mortal life in the flesh the soul is of embryonic estate; it is born (resurrected) in the morontia life and experiences growth through the successive morontia worlds. And the souls of the Caligastia one hundred had thus expanded through the progressive experiences of the seven mansion worlds to citizenship status on Jerusem.” <a id="s1061_626"></a>[UB 66:4.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_8)

	> “The Life Carriers, the architects of form, provide such volunteers with new physical bodies, which they occupy for the periods of their planetary sojourn. These personality forms, while exempt from the ordinary diseases of the realms, are, like the early morontia bodies, subject to certain accidents of a mechanical nature.” <a id="s1063_330"></a>[UB 50:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_3)

7. Two classes of offspring result from the sex mating of the Prince’s staff.

	> “These assistants to the Planetary Prince seldom mate with the world races, but they do always mate among themselves. Two classes of beings result from these unions: the primary type of midway creatures and certain high types of material beings who remain attached to the prince’s staff after their parents have been removed from the planet at the time of the arrival of Adam and Eve. These children do not mate with the mortal races except in certain emergencies and then only by direction of the Planetary Prince. In such an event, their children—the grandchildren of the corporeal staff—are in status as of the superior races of their day and generation. All the offspring of these semimaterial assistants of the Planetary Prince are Adjuster indwelt.” <a id="s1067_759"></a>[UB 50:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_5)

	> “In conformity to their instructions the staff did not engage in sexual reproduction, but they did painstakingly study their personal constitutions, and they carefully explored every imaginable phase of intellectual (mind) and morontia (soul) liaison. And it was during the thirty-third year of their sojourn in Dalamatia, long before the wall was completed, that number two and number seven of the Danite group accidentally discovered a phenomenon attendant upon the liaison of their morontia selves (supposedly nonsexual and nonmaterial); and the result of this adventure proved to be the first of the primary midway creatures. This new being was wholly visible to the planetary staff and to their celestial associates but was not visible to the men and women of the various human tribes. Upon authority of the Planetary Prince the entire corporeal staff undertook the production of similar beings, and all were successful, following the instructions of the pioneer Danite pair. Thus did the Prince’s staff eventually bring into being the original corps of 50,000 primary midwayers.” <a id="s1069_1089"></a>[UB 66:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_10)

8. The Caligastia one hundred were kept immortal by fruit from the tree of life.

	> “3. The Caligastia one hundred were personally immortal, or undying. There circulated through their material forms the antidotal complements of the life currents of the system; and had they not lost contact with the life circuits through rebellion, they would have lived on indefinitely until the arrival of a subsequent Son of God, or until their sometime later release to resume the interrupted journey to Havona and Paradise.
	> 
	> “These antidotal complements of the Satania life currents were derived from the fruit of the tree of life, a shrub of Edentia which was sent to Urantia by the Most Highs of Norlatiadek at the time of Caligastia’s arrival. In the days of Dalamatia this tree grew in the central courtyard of the temple of the unseen Father, and it was the fruit of the tree of life that enabled the material and otherwise mortal beings of the Prince’s staff to live on indefinitely as long as they had access to it. “While of no value to the evolutionary races, this supersustenance was quite sufficient to confer continuous life upon the Caligastia one hundred and also upon the one hundred modified Andonites who were associated with them.” <a id="s1075_728"></a>[UB 66:4.12-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_12)

#### C. The Prince’s reign.

1. Each of the ten commissions set about slowly to advance the primitive races.

	> “The Caligastia one hundred—graduates of the Satania mansion worlds—well knew the arts and culture of Jerusem, but such knowledge is nearly valueless on a barbaric planet populated by primitive humans. These wise beings knew better than to undertake the _sudden_ transformation, or the en masse uplifting, of the primitive races of that day. They well understood the slow evolution of the human species, and they wisely refrained from any radical attempts at modifying man’s mode of life on earth.
	> 
	> “Each of the ten planetary commissions set about _slowly_ and naturally to advance the interests intrusted to them. Their plan consisted in attracting the best minds of the surrounding tribes and, after training them, sending them back to their people as emissaries of social uplift.” <a id="s1083_288"></a>[UB 66:6.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_3)

2. They used natives of the tribes or races to uplift the mores of the races

	> “Foreign emissaries were never sent to a race except upon the specific request of that people. Those who labored for the uplift and advancement of a given tribe or race were always natives of that tribe or race. The one hundred would not attempt to impose the habits and mores of even a superior race upon another tribe. Always they patiently worked to uplift and advance the time-tried mores of each race. The simple folk of Urantia brought their social customs to Dalamatia, not to exchange them for new and better practices, but to have them uplifted by contact with a higher culture and by association with superior minds. The process was slow but very effectual.” <a id="s1087_672"></a>[UB 66:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_5)

3. They attempted to accelerate normal and natural evolution.

	> “The Dalamatia teachers sought to add conscious social selection to the purely natural selection of biologic evolution. They did not derange human society, but they did markedly accelerate its normal and natural evolution. Their motive was progression by evolution and not revolution by revelation. The human race had spent ages in acquiring the little religion and morals it had, and these supermen knew better than to rob mankind of these few advances by the confusion and dismay which always result when enlightened and superior beings undertake to uplift the backward races by overteaching and overenlightenment.” <a id="s1091_621"></a>[UB 66:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_6)

4. Civilization progressed normally for about 300,000 years.

	> “From the arrival of Prince Caligastia, planetary civilization progressed in a fairly normal manner for almost three hundred thousand years. Aside from being a life-modification sphere and therefore subject to numerous irregularities and unusual episodes of evolutionary fluctuation, Urantia progressed very satisfactorily in its planetary career up to the times of the Lucifer rebellion and the concurrent Caligastia betrayal. All subsequent history has been definitely modified by this catastrophic blunder as well as by the later failure of Adam and Eve to fulfill their planetary mission.” <a id="s1095_597"></a>[UB 66:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_3)

5. Calagastia joined Lucifer in rebellion.

	> “The Prince of Urantia went into darkness at the time of the Lucifer rebellion, thus precipitating the long confusion of the planet. He was subsequently deprived of sovereign authority by the coordinate action of the constellation rulers and other universe authorities. He shared the inevitable vicissitudes of isolated Urantia down to the time of Adam’s sojourn on the planet and contributed something to the miscarriage of the plan to uplift the mortal races through the infusion of the lifeblood of the new violet race—the descendants of Adam and Eve.” <a id="s1099_559"></a>[UB 66:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_4)

#### D. Results of the rebellion.

1. Great confusion reigned in Dalamatia and before long society sank to its old biologic level.

	> “Great confusion reigned in Dalamatia and thereabout for almost fifty years after the instigation of rebellion. The complete and radical reorganization of the whole world was attempted; revolution displaced evolution as the policy of cultural advancement and racial improvement. Among the superior and partially trained sojourners in and near Dalamatia there appeared a sudden advancement in cultural status, but when these new and radical methods were attempted on the outlying peoples, indescribable confusion and racial pandemonium was the immediate result. Liberty was quickly translated into license by the half-evolved primitive men of those days.
	> 
	> “Very soon after the rebellion the entire staff of sedition were engaged in energetic defense of the city against the hordes of semisavages who besieged its walls as a result of the doctrines of liberty which had been prematurely taught them. And years before the beautiful headquarters went down beneath the southern waves, the misled and mistaught tribes of the Dalamatia hinterland had already swept down in semisavage assault on the splendid city, driving the secession staff and their associates northward.
	> 
	> “The Caligastia scheme for the immediate reconstruction of human society in accordance with his ideas of individual freedom and group liberties, proved a swift and more or less complete failure. Society quickly sank back to its old biologic level, and the forward struggle began all over, starting not very far in advance of where it was at the beginning of the Caligastia regime, this upheaval having left the world in confusion worse confounded.” <a id="s1109_452"></a>[UB 67:5.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p5_1)

2. The Caligastia downfall had little effect upon biologic evolution, and ultimately the developmental progress of the Urantia races neared its apex.

	> “The cultural decadence and spiritual poverty resulting from the Caligastia downfall and consequent social confusion had little effect on the physical or biologic status of the Urantia peoples. Organic evolution proceeded apace, quite regardless of the cultural and moral setback which so swiftly followed the disaffection of Caligastia and Daligastia. And there came a time in the planetary history, almost forty thousand years ago, when biologic standpoint, the developmental progress of the Urantia races was nearing its apex. The Melchizedek receivers, concurring in this opinion, readily agreed to join the Life Carriers in a petition to the Most Highs of Edentia asking that Urantia be inspected with a view to authorizing the dispatch of biologic uplifters, a Material Son and Daughter.” <a id="s1113_798"></a>[UB 73:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p0_1)

#### E. The Nodites and the Amadonites.

1. When the rebel members of the Prince’s staff realized they were degraded to the status of mortal beings, they resorted to sexual reproduction.

	> “The sixty members of the planetary staff who went into rebellion chose Nod as their leader. They worked wholeheartedly for the rebel Prince but soon discovered that they were deprived of the sustenance of the system life circuits. They awakened to the fact that they had been degraded to the status of mortal beings. They were indeed superhuman but, at the same time, material and mortal. In an effort to increase their numbers, Daligastia ordered immediate resort to sexual reproduction, knowing full well that the original sixty and their forty-four modified Andonite associates were doomed to suffer extinction by death, sooner or later. After the fall of Dalamatia the disloyal staff migrated to the north and the east. Their descendants were long known as the Nodites, and their dwelling place as ‘the land of Nod.’” <a id="s1119_826"></a>[UB 67:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p4_2)

2. Derivation of the Nodites and Amadonites.

	> “The _Nodites_ were the descendants of the rebel members of the Prince’s staff, their name deriving from their first leader, Nod, onetime chairman of the Dalamatia commission on industry and trade. The _Amadonites_ were the descendants of those Andonites who chose to remain loyal with Van and Amadon. ‘Amadonite’ is more of a cultural and religious designation than a racial term; racially considered the Amadonites were essentially _Andonites_. ‘Nodite’ is both a cultural and racial term, for the Nodites themselves constituted the eighth race of Urantia.” <a id="s1123_563"></a>[UB 73:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1_3)

3. The Nodites were a superior race because of unexpected modification of the life plasms from the Andonite contributors.

	> “Since the one hundred corporeal members of the Prince’s staff carried germ plasm of the Andonic human strains, it would naturally be expected that, if they engaged in sexual reproduction, their progeny would altogether resemble the offspring of other Andonite parents. But when the sixty rebels of the staff, the followers of Nod, actually engaged in sexual reproduction, their children proved to be far superior in almost every way to both the Andonite and the Sangik peoples. This unexpected excellence characterized not only physical and intellectual qualities but also spiritual capacities.
	> 
	> “These mutant traits appearing in the first Nodite generation resulted from certain changes which had been wrought in the configuration and in the chemical constituents of the inheritance factors of the Andonic germ plasm. These changes were caused by the presence in the bodies of the staff members of the powerful lifemaintenance circuits of the Satania system. These life circuits caused the chromosomes of the specialized Urantia pattern to reorganize more after the patterns of the standardized Satania specialization of the ordained Nebadon life manifestation. The technique of this germ plasm metamorphosis by the action of the system life currents is not unlike those procedures whereby Urantia scientists modify the germ plasm of plants and animals by the use of X rays.
	> 
	> “Thus did the Nodite peoples arise out of certain peculiar and unexpected modifications occurring in the life plasm which had been transferred from the bodies of the Andonite contributors to those of the corporeal staff members by the Avalon surgeons.
	> 
	> “It will be recalled that the one hundred Andonite germ plasm contributors were in turn made possessors of the organic complement of the tree of life so that the Satania life currents likewise invested their bodies. The forty-four modified Andonites who followed the staff into rebellion also mated among themselves and made a great contribution to the better strains of the Nodite people.
	> 
	> “These two groups, embracing 104 individuals who carried the modified Andonite germ plasm, constitute the ancestry of the Nodites, the eighth race to appear on Urantia. And this new feature of human life on Urantia represents another phase of the outworking of the original plan of utilizing this planet as a life-modification world, except that this was one of the unforeseen developments.” <a id="s1135_395"></a>[UB 77:2.4-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_4)

4. Division of the Nodites.

	> “Shortly after the destruction of Dalamatia the followers of Nod became divided into three major groups. The central group remained in the immediate vicinity of their original home near the headwaters of the Persian Gulf. The eastern group migrated to the highland regions of Elam just east of the Euphrates valley. The western group was situated on the northeastern Syrian shores of the Mediterranean and in adjacent territory.” <a id="s1139_433"></a>[UB 73:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1_5)

5. Nodites and Amadonites became the most advanced races on earth.

	> “These Nodites had freely mated with the Sangik races and had left behind an able progeny. And some of the descendants of the rebellious Dalamatians subsequently joined Van and his loyal followers in the lands north of Mesopotamia. Here, in the vicinity of Lake Van and the southern Caspian Sea region, the Nodites mingled and mixed with the Amadonites, and they were numbered among the ‘mighty men of old.’
	> 
	> “Prior to the arrival of Adam and Eve these groups—Nodites and Amadonites—were the most advanced and cultured races on earth.” <a id="s1145_130"></a>[UB 73:1.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1_6)

6. Deterioration of the Nodites.

	> “The pure-line Nodites were a magnificent race, but they gradually mingled with the evolutionary peoples of earth, and before long great deterioration had occurred. Ten thousand years after the rebellion they had lost ground to the point where their average length of life was little more than that of the evolutionary races.” <a id="s1149_330"></a>[UB 77:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_9)

7. After the submergence of Dalamatia the Nodites founded Dilmun as their headquarters city. They planned a tower as a monument to their race.

	> “After the submergence of Dalamatia the Nodites moved north and east, presently founding the new city of Dilmun as their racial and cultural headquarters. And about fifty thousand years after the death of Nod, when the offspring of the Prince’s staff had become too numerous to find subsistence in the lands immediately surrounding their new city of Dilmun, and after they had reached out to intermarry with the Andonite and Sangik tribes adjoining their borders, it occurred to their leaders that something should be done to preserve their racial unity. Accordingly a council of the tribes was called, and after much deliberation the plan of Bablot, a descendant of Nod, was endorsed.
	> 
	> “Bablot proposed to erect a pretentious temple of racial glorification at the center of their then occupied territory. This temple was to have a tower the like of which the world had never seen. It was to be a monumental memorial to their passing greatness. There were many who wished to have this monument erected in Dilmun, but others contended that such a great structure should be placed a safe distance from the dangers of the sea, remembering the traditions of the engulfment of their first capital, Dalamatia.” <a id="s1155_521"></a>[UB 77:3.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_1)

8. Different views as to the purpose of the tower caused dissension and dispersion.

	> “But the Nodites were still somewhat divided in sentiment as to the plans and purposes of this undertaking. Neither were their leaders altogether agreed concerning either construction plans or usage of the buildings after they should be completed. After four and one-half years of work a great dispute arose about the object and motive for the erection of the tower. The contentions became so bitter that all work stopped. The food carriers spread the news of the dissension, and large numbers of the tribes began to forgather at the building site. Three differing views were propounded as to the purpose of building the tower.
	> “1. The largest group, almost one half, desired to see the tower built as a memorial of Nodite history and racial superiority. They thought it ought to be a great and imposing structure which would challenge the admiration of all future generations.
	> “2. The next largest faction wanted the tower designed to commemorate the Dilmun culture. They foresaw that Bablot would become a great center of commerce, art, and manufacture.
	> “3. The smallest and minority contingent held that the erection of the tower presented an opportunity for making atonement for the folly of their progenitors in participating in the Caligastia rebellion. They maintained that the tower should be devoted to the worship of the Father of all, that the whole purpose of the new city should be to take the place of Dalamatia—to function as the cultural and religious center for the surrounding barbarians.
	> “The religious group were promptly voted down. The majority rejected the teaching that their ancestors had been guilty of rebellion; they resented such a racial stigma. Having disposed of one of the three angles to the dispute and failing to settle the other two by debate, they fell to fighting. The religionists, the noncombatants, fled to their homes in the south, while their fellows fought until well-nigh obliterated.” <a id="s1163_428"></a>[UB 77:3.4-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_4)

#### F. Nodite centers of civilization.

1. The dispersion of the Nodites led to the establishment of four centers of Nodite culture.

	> “The dispersion of the Nodites was an immediate result of the internecine conflict over the tower of Babel. This internal war greatly reduced the numbers of the purer Nodites and was in many ways responsible for their failure to establish a great pre-Adamic civilization. From this time on Nodite culture declined for over one hundred and twenty thousand years until it was upstepped by Adamic infusion. But even in the times of Adam the Nodites were still an able people. Many of their mixed descendants were numbered among the Garden builders, and several of Van’s group captains were Nodites. Some of the most capable minds serving on Adam’s staff were of this race.
	> 
	> “Three out of the four great Nodite centers were established immediately following the Bablot conflict:
	> “1. _The western or Syrian Nodites_. The remnants of the nationalistic or racial memorialists journeyed northward, uniting with the Andonites to found the later Nodite centers to the northwest of Mesopotamia. This was the largest group of the dispersing Nodites, and they contributed much to the later appearing Assyrian stock.
	> “2. _The eastern or Elamite Nodites_. The culture and commerce advocates migrated in large numbers eastward into Elam and there united with the mixed Sangik tribes. The Elamites of thirty to forty thousand years ago had become largely Sangik in nature, although they continued to maintain a civilization superior to that of the surrounding barbarians.
	> “After the establishment of the second garden it was customary to allude to this near-by Nodite settlement as ‘the land of Nod’; and during the long period of relative peace between this Nodite group and the Adamites, the two more the custom for the Sons of God (the Adamites) to intermarry with the daughters of men (the Nodites).
	> “3. _The central or pre-Sumerian Nodites_. A small group at the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers maintained more of their racial integrity. They persisted for thousands of years and eventually furnished the Nodite ancestry which blended with the Adamites to found the Sumerian peoples of historic times.
	> “And all this explains how the Sumerians appeared so suddenly and mysteriously on the stage of action in Mesopotamia. Investigators will never be able to trace out and follow these tribes back to the beginning of the Sumerians, who had their origin two hundred thousand years ago after the submergence of Dalamatia. Without a trace of origin elsewhere in the world, these ancient tribes suddenly loom upon the horizon of civilization with a full-grown and superior culture, embracing temples, metalwork, agriculture, animals, pottery, weaving, commercial law, civil codes, religious ceremonial, and an old system of writing. At the beginning of the historical era they had long since lost the alphabet of Dalamatia, having adopted the peculiar writing system originating in Dilmun. The Sumerian language, though virtually lost to the world, was not Semitic; it had much in common with the so-called Aryan tongues.
	> “The elaborate records left by the Sumerians describe the site of a remarkable settlement which was located on the Persian Gulf near the earlier city of Dilmun. The Egyptians called this city of ancient glory Dilmat, while the later Adamized Sumerians confused both the first and second Nodite cities with Dalamatia and called all three Dilmun. And already have archaeologists found these ancient Sumerian clay tablets which tell of this earthly paradise ‘where the Gods first blessed mankind with the example of civilized and cultured life.’ And these tablets, descriptive of Dilmun, the paradise of men and God, are now silently resting on the dusty shelves of many museums.
	> “The Sumerians well knew of the first and second Edens but, despite extensive intermarriage with the Adamites, continued to regard the garden dwellers to the north as an alien race. Sumerian pride in the more ancient Nodite culture led them to ignore these later vistas of glory in favor of the grandeur and paradisiacal traditions of the city of Dilmun.
	> “4. _The northern Nodites and Amadonites—the Vanites_. This group arose prior to the Bablot conflict. These northernmost Nodites were descendants of those who had forsaken the leadership of Nod and his successors for that of Van and Amadon.
	> “Some of the early associates of Van subsequently settled about the shores of the lake which still bears his name, and their traditions grew up about this locality. Ararat became their sacred mountain, having much the same meaning to laterday Vanites that Sinai had to the Hebrews. Ten thousand years ago the Vanite ancestors of the Assyrians taught that their moral law of seven commandments had been given to Van by the Gods upon Mount Ararat. They firmly believed that Van and his associate Amadon were taken alive from the planet while they were up on the mountain engaged in worship.
	> “Mount Ararat was the sacred mountain of northern Mesopotamia, and since much of your tradition of these ancient times was acquired in connection with the Babylonian story of the flood, it is not surprising that Mount Ararat and its region were woven into the later Jewish story of Noah and the universal flood.
	> “About 35,000 B.C. Adamson visited one of the easternmost of the old Vanite settlements to found his center of civilization.” <a id="s1182_129"></a>[UB 77:4.1-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_1)

### II. **The Adamic Dispensation**

#### A. Post-Adamic man on a normal planet.

1. When man reaches the limit of evolutionary development biologic uplifters are sent.

	> “When the original impetus of evolutionary life has run its biologic course, when man has reached the apex of animal development, there arrives the second order of sonship, and the second dispensation of grace and ministry is inaugurated. This is true on all evolutionary worlds. When the highest possible level of evolutionary life has been attained, when primitive man has ascended as far as possible in the biologic scale, a Material Son and Daughter always appear on the planet, having been dispatched by the System Sovereign.<a id="s1190_533"></a>[UB 52:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_1)

2. Accomplishments of the Material Son and Daughter dispensation.

	> “It is the prime purpose of the Adamic regime to influence evolving man to complete the transit from the hunter and herder stage of civilization to that of the agriculturist and horticulturist, to be later supplemented by the appearance of the urban and industrial adjuncts to civilization. Ten thousand years of this dispensation of the biologic uplifters is sufficient to effect a marvelous transformation. Twenty-five thousand years of such an administration of the conjoint wisdom of the Planetary Prince and the Material Sons usually ripens the sphere for the advent of a Magisterial Son.
	> 
	> “This age usually witnesses the completion of the elimination of the unfit and the still further purification of the racial strains; on normal worlds the defective bestial tendencies are very nearly eliminated from the reproducing stocks of the realm.
	> 
	> “The Adamic progeny never amalgamate with the inferior strains of the evolutionary races. Neither is it the divine plan for the Planetary Adam or Eve to mate, personally, with the evolutionary peoples. This race-improvement project is the task of their progeny. But the offspring of the Material Son and Daughter are mobilized for generations before the racial-amalgamation ministry is inaugurated.
	> 
	> “The result of the gift of the Adamic life plasm to the mortal races is an immediate upstepping of intellectual capacity and an acceleration of spiritual progress. There is usually some physical improvement also. On an average world the post-Adamic dispensation is an age of great invention, energy control, and mechanical development. This is the era of the appearance of multiform manufacture and the control of natural forces; it is the golden age of exploration and the final subduing of the planet. Much of the material progress of a world occurs during this time of the inauguration of the development of the physical sciences, just such an epoch as Urantia is now experiencing. Your world is a full dispensation and more behind the average planetary schedule.” <a id="s1200_771"></a>[UB 52:3.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_3)

	> “The post-Adamic epoch is the dispensation of internationalism. With the near completion of the task of race blending, nationalism wanes, and the brotherhood of man really begins to materialize. Representative government begins to take the place of the monarchial or paternal form of rulership. The educational system becomes world-wide, and gradually the languages of the races give way to the tongue of the violet people. Universal peace and cooperation are seldom attained until the races are fairly well blended, and until they speak a common language.
	> 
	> “During the closing centuries of the post-Adamic age there develops new interest in art, music, and literature, and this world-wide awakening is the signal for the appearance of a Magisterial Son. The crowning development of this era is the universal interest in intellectual realities, true philosophy. Religion becomes less nationalistic, becomes more and more a planetary affair. New revelations of truth characterize these ages, and the Most Highs of the constellations begin to rule in the affairs of men. Truth is revealed up to the administration of the constellations.
	> 
	> “Great ethical advancement characterizes this era; the brotherhood of man is the goal of its society. World-wide peace—the cessation of race conflict and national animosity—is the indicator of planetary ripeness for the advent of the third order of sonship, the Magisterial Son.” <a id="s1206_283"></a>[UB 52:3.10-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_10)

#### B. Adam and Eve on Urantia.

1. Van transplants the tree of life to the center of the Garden of Eden.

	> “In the center of the Garden temple Van planted the long-guarded tree of life, whose leaves were for the ‘healing of the nations,’ and whose fruit had so long sustained him on earth. Van well knew that Adam and Eve would also be dependent on this gift of Edentia for their life maintenance after they once appeared on Urantia in material form.
	> 
	> “The Material Sons on the system capitals do not require the tree of life for sustenance. Only in the planetary repersonalization are they dependent on this adjunct to physical immortality.” <a id="s1214_194"></a>[UB 73:6.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p6_1)

2. The “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” may be a figure of speech, but the “tree of life” was real.

	> “The ‘tree of the knowledge of good and evil’ may be a figure of speech, a symbolic designation covering a multitude of human experiences, but the ‘tree of life’ was not a myth; it was real and for a long time was present on Urantia. When the Most of Edentia approved the commission of Caligastia as Planetary Prince of Urantia and those of the one hundred Jerusem citizens as his administrative staff, they sent to the planet, by the Melchizedeks, a shrub of Edentia, and this plant grew to be the tree of life on Urantia. This form of nonintelligent life is native to the constellation headquarters spheres, being also found on the headquarters worlds of the local and superuniverses as well as on the Havona spheres, but not on the system capitals.” <a id="s1218_756"></a>[UB 73:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p6_3)

3. The Melchizedeks instructed Adam and Eve concerning their planetary mission.

	> “The Melchizedeks counseled Adam not to initiate the program of racial uplift and blending until his own family had numbered onehalf million. It was never intended that the Garden should be the permanent home of the Adamites. They were to become emissaries of a new life to all the world; they were to mobilize for unselfish bestowal upon the needy races of earth.
	> 
	> “The instructions given Adam by the Melchizedeks implied that he was to establish racial, continental, and divisional headquarters to be in charge of his immediate sons and daughters, while he and Eve were to divide their time between these various world capitals as advisers and co-ordinators of the world-wide ministry of biologic uplift, intellectual advancement, and moral rehabilitation.” <a id="s1224_397"></a>[UB 73:7.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p7_3)

4. No Material Sons of Nebadon had a more difficult task than those of Urantia, but patience would have led to success.

	> “Probably no Material Sons of Nebadon were ever faced with such a difficult and seemingly hopeless task as confronted Adam and Eve in the sorry plight of Urantia. But they would have sometime met with success had they been more farseeing and _patient._ Both of them, especially Eve, were altogether too impatient; they were not willing to settle down to the long, long endurance test. They wanted to see some immediate results, and they did, but the results thus secured proved most disastrous both to themselves and to their world.” <a id="s1228_537"></a>[UB 75:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_6)

5. Adam and Eve defaulted, but still contributed much to the races of Urantia.

	> “Adam and Eve did fall from their high estate of material sonship down to the lowly status of mortal man. But that was not the fall of man. The human race has been uplifted despite the immediate consequences of the Adamic default. Although the divine plan of giving the violet race to the Urantia peoples miscarried, the mortal races have profited enormously from the limited contribution which Adam and his descendants made to the Urantia races.
	> 
	> “There has been no ‘fall of man.’ The history of the human race is one of progressive evolution, and the Adamic bestowal left the world peoples greatly improved over their previous biologic condition. The more superior stocks of Urantia now contain inheritance factors derived from as many as four separate sources: Andonite, Sangik, Nodite, and Adamic.
	> 
	> “Adam should not be regarded as the cause of a curse on the human race. While he did fail in carrying forward the divine plan, while he did transgress his covenant with Deity, while he and his mate were most certainly degraded in creature status, notwithstanding all this, their contribution to the human race did much to advance civilization on Urantia.” <a id="s1236_359"></a>[UB 75:8.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p8_1)

6. The great value of patience. The miscarriage of the Adamic mission on Urantia was largely due to impatience.

	> “In estimating the results of the Adamic mission on your world, justice demands the recognition of the condition of the planet. Adam was confronted with a well-nigh hopeless task when, with his beautiful mate, he was transported from Jerusem to this dark and confused planet. But had they been guided by the counsel of the Melchizedeks and their associates, and _had they been more patient_, they would have eventually met with success. But Eve listened to the insidious propaganda of personal liberty and planetary freedom of action. She was led to experiment with the life plasm of the material order of sonship in that she allowed this life trust to become prematurely commingled with that of the then mixed order of the original design of the Life Carriers which had been previously combined with that of the reproducing beings once attached to the staff of the Planetary Prince.
	> 
	> “Never, in all your ascent to Paradise, will you gain anything by impatiently attempting to circumvent the established and divine plan by short cuts, personal inventions, or other devices for improving on the way of perfection, to perfection, and for eternal perfection.” <a id="s1242_275"></a>[UB 75:8.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p8_4)

7. In evolutionary universes perfection is our goal, not our origin. This is not a mechanistic universe.

	> “All in all, there probably never was a more disheartening miscarriage of wisdom on any planet in all Nebadon. But it is not surprising that these missteps occur in the affairs of the evolutionary universes. We are a part of a gigantic creation, and it is not strange that everything does not work in perfection; our universe was not created in perfection. Perfection is our eternal goal, not our origin.
	> 
	> “If this were a mechanistic universe, if the First Great Source and Center were only a force and not also a personality, if all creation were a vast aggregation of physical matter dominated by precise laws characterized by unvarying energy actions, then might perfection obtain, even despite the incompleteness of universe status. There would be no disagreement; there would be no friction. But in our evolving universe of relative perfection and imperfection we rejoice that disagreement and misunderstanding are possible, for thereby is evidenced the fact and the act of personality in the universe. And if our creation is an existence dominated by personality, then can you be assured of the possibilities of personality survival, advancement, and achievement; we can be confident of personality growth, experience, and adventure. What a glorious universe, in that it is personal and progressive, not merely mechanical or even passively perfect!” <a id="s1248_953"></a>[UB 75:8.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p8_6)

8. In spite of the default, Adam contributed much to Urantia culture. The people make a civilization. Civilization does not make the people.

	> “And thus ends the story of the Planetary Adam and Eve of Urantia, a story of trial, tragedy, and triumph, at least personal triumph for your well-meaning but deluded Material Son and Daughter and undoubtedly, in the end, a story of ultimate triumph for their world and its rebellion-tossed and evil-harassed inhabitants. When all is summed up, Adam and Eve made a mighty contribution to the speedy civilization and accelerated biologic progress of the human race. They left a great culture on earth, but it was not possible for such an advanced civilization to survive in the face of the early dilution and the eventual submergence of the Adamic inheritance. It is the people who make a civilization; civilization does not make the people.” <a id="s1252_745"></a>[UB 76:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_4)

#### C. The violet race.

1. Plan for the marriage of Adam’s children to the superior evolutionary races.

	> “Usually the violet peoples do not begin to amalgamate with the planetary natives until their own group numbers over one million. But in the meantime the staff of the Planetary Prince proclaims that the children of the Gods have come down, as it were, to be one with the races of men; and the people eagerly look forward to the day when announcement will be made that those who have qualified as belonging to the superior racial strains may proceed to the Garden of Eden and be there chosen by the sons and daughters of Adam as the evolutionary fathers and mothers of the new and blended order of mankind.” <a id="s1258_610"></a>[UB 51:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5_2)

2. On normal worlds the Planetary Prince’s staff supervise the mating of the Adamites and the evolutionary peoples.

	> “On normal worlds the Planetary Adam and Eve never mate with the evolutionary races. This work of biologic betterment is a function of the Adamic progeny. But these Adamites do not go out among the races; the prince’s staff bring to the Garden of Eden the superior men and women for voluntary mating with the Adamic offspring. And on most worlds it is considered the highest honor to be selected as a candidate for mating with the sons and daughters of the garden.” <a id="s1262_469"></a>[UB 51:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5_3)

3. The violet race is a monogamous people.

	> “The violet race is a monogamous people, and every evolutionary man or woman uniting with the Adamic sons and daughters pledges not to take other mates and to instruct his or her children in single-matedness. The children of each of these unions are educated and trained in the schools of the Planetary Prince and then are permitted to go forth to the race of their evolutionary parent, there to marry among the selected groups of superior mortals.” <a id="s1266_453"></a>[UB 51:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5_5)

4. Cardinal characteristics of the violet race founded by Adam and Eve.

	> “Adam and Eve were the founders of the violet race of men, the ninth human race to appear on Urantia. Adam and his offspring had blue eyes, and the violet peoples were characterized by fair complexions and light hair color—yellow, red, and brown.
	> 
	> ”Eve did not suffer pain in childbirth; neither did the early evolutionary races. Only the mixed races produced by the union of evolutionary man with the Nodites and later with the Adamites suffered the severe pangs of childbirth.” <a id="s1272_235"></a>[UB 76:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_1)

5. Adam and Eve had a dual nutrition. Their children had only the mortal type of nutrition.

	> “Adam and Eve, like their brethren on Jerusem, were energized by dual nutrition, subsisting on both food and light, supplemented by certain superphysical energies unrevealed on Urantia. Their Urantia offspring did not inherit the parental endowment of energy intake and light circulation. They had a single circulation, the human type of blood sustenance. They were designedly mortal though long-lived, albeit longevity gravitated toward the human norm with each succeeding generation.” <a id="s1276_490"></a>[UB 76:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_3)

6. Dietetic habits of Adam and his offspring.

	> “Adam and Eve and their first generation of children did not use the flesh of animals for food. They subsisted wholly upon ‘the fruits of the trees.’ After the first generation all of the descendants of Adam began to partake of dairy products, but many of them continued to follow a nonflesh diet. Many of the southern tribes with whom they later united were also nonflesh eaters. Later on, most of these vegetarian tribes migrated to the east and survived as now admixed in the peoples of India.” <a id="s1280_501"></a>[UB 76:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_4)

7. Adam and Eve had superior special senses.

	> “Both the physical and spiritual visions of Adam and Eve were far superior to those of the present-day peoples. Their special senses were much more acute, and they were able to see the midwayers and the angelic hosts, the Melchizedeks, and the fallen Prince Caligastia, who several times came to confer with his noble successor. They retained the ability to see these celestial beings for over one hundred years after the default. These special senses were not so acutely present in their children and tended to diminish with each succeeding generation.” <a id="s1284_558"></a>[UB 76:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_5)

8. The early beginning of the Andite race.

	> “After becoming established in the second garden on the Euphrates, Adam elected to leave behind as much of his life plasm as possible to benefit the world after his death. Accordingly, Eve was made the head of a commission of twelve on race improvement, and before Adam died this commission had selected 1,682 of the highest type of women on Urantia, and these women were impregnated with the Adamic life plasm. Their children all grew up to maturity except 112, so that the world, in this way, was benefited by the addition of 1,570 superior men and women. Though these candidate mothers were selected from all the surrounding tribes and represented most of the races on earth, the majority were chosen from the highest strains of the Nodites, and they constituted the early beginnings of the mighty Andite race. These children were born and reared in the tribal surroundings of their respective mothers.” <a id="s1288_910"></a>[UB 76:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_8)

#### D. Story of Adamson and Ratta—the origin of secondary midwayers.

1. Adamson elected to remain on earth. After the establishment of the second garden he set out to find the home of Van and Amadon.

	> “Adamson was among that group of the children of Adam and Eve who elected to remain on earth with their father and mother. Now this eldest son of Adam had often heard from Van and Amadon the story of their highland home in the north, and sometime after the establishment of the second garden he determined to go in search of this land of his youthful dreams.
	> 
	> “Adamson was 120 years old at this time and had been the father of thirty-two pure-line children of the first garden. He wanted to remain with his parents and assist them in upbuilding the second garden, but he was greatly disturbed by the loss of his mate and their children, who had all elected to go to Edentia along with those other Adamic children who chose to become wards of the Most Highs.
	> 
	> “Adamson would not desert his parents on Urantia, he was disinclined to flee from hardship or danger, but he found the associations of the second garden far from satisfying. He did much to forward the early activities of defense and construction but decided to leave for the north at the earliest opportunity. And though his departure was wholly pleasant, Adam and Eve were much grieved to lose their eldest son, to have him go out into a strange and hostile world, as they feared, never to return.” <a id="s1298_503"></a>[UB 77:5.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p5_2)

2. Adamson met and married Ratta, a pure-line descendant of the Prince’s staff.

	> “A company of twenty-seven followed Adamson northward in quest of these people of his childhood fantasies. In a little over three years Adamson’s party actually found the object of their adventure, and among these people he discovered a wonderful and beautiful woman, twenty years old, who claimed to be the last pure-line descendant of the Prince’s staff. This woman, Ratta, said that her ancestors were all descendants of two of the fallen staff of the Prince. She was the last of her race, having no living brothers or sisters. She had about decided not to mate, had about made up her mind to die without issue, but she lost her heart to the majestic Adamson. And when she heard the story of Eden, how the predictions of Van and Amadon had really come to pass, and as she listened to the recital of the Garden default, she was encompassed with but a single thought—to marry this son and heir of Adam. And quickly the idea grew upon Adamson. In a little more than three months they were married.” <a id="s1302_1002"></a>[UB 77:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p5_5)

3. Origin of secondary midwayers.

	> “Adamson and Ratta had a family of sixty-seven children. They gave origin to a great line of the world’s leadership, but they did something more. It should be remembered that both of these beings were really superhuman. Every fourth child born to them was of a unique order. It was often invisible. Never in the world’s history had such a thing occurred. Ratta was greatly perturbed—even superstitious—but Adamson well knew of the existence of the primary midwayers, and he concluded that something similar was transpiring before his eyes. When the second strangely behaving offspring arrived, he decided to mate them, since one was male and the other female, and this is the origin of the secondary order of midwayers. Within one hundred years, before this phenomenon ceased, almost two thousand were brought into being.
	> 
	> “Adamson lived for 396 years. Many times he returned to visit his father and mother. Every seven years he and Ratta journeyed south to the second garden, and meanwhile the midwayers kept him informed regarding the welfare of his people. During Adamson’s life they did great service in upbuilding a new and independent world center for truth and righteousness.
	> 
	> “Adamson and Ratta thus had at their command this corps of marvelous helpers, who labored with them throughout their long lives to assist in the propagation of advanced truth and in the spread of higher standards of spiritual, intellectual, and physical living. And the results of this effort at world betterment never did become fully eclipsed by subsequent retrogressions.” <a id="s1310_379"></a>[UB 77:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p5_6)

4. The culture of the Adamsonites.

	> “The Adamsonites maintained a high culture for almost seven thousand years from the times of Adamson and Ratta. Later on they became admixed with the neighboring Nodites and Andonites and were also included among the ‘mighty men of old.’ And some of the advances of that age persisted to become a latent part of the cultural potential which later blossomed into European civilization.
	> 
	> “This center of civilization was situated in the region east of the southern end of the Caspian Sea, near the Kopet Dagh. A short way up in the foothills of Turkestan are the vestiges of what was onetime the Adamsonite headquarters of the violet race. In these highland sites, situated in a narrow and ancient fertile belt lying in the lower foothills of the Kopet range, there successively arose at various periods four diverse cultures respectively fostered by four different groups of Adamson’s descendants. It was the second of these groups which migrated westward to Greece and the islands of the Mediterranean. The residue of Adamson’s descendants migrated north and west to enter Europe with the blended stock of the last Andite wave coming out of Mesopotamia, and they were also numbered among the Andite-Aryan invaders of India.” <a id="s1316_842"></a>[UB 77:5.9-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p5_9)

### III. **Present-day Problems Resulting from Rebellion and Default**

#### A. Repercussions of the Lucifer rebellion.

1. Problems of true and false liberty growing out of the Lucifer rebellion.

	> “Of all the perplexing problems growing out of the Lucifer rebellion, none has occasioned more difficulty than the failure of immature evolutionary mortals to distinguish between true and false liberty.
	> 
	> “True liberty is the quest of the ages and the reward of evolutionary progress. False liberty is the subtle deception of the error of time and the evil of space. Enduring liberty is predicated on the reality of justice—intelligence, maturity, fraternity, and equity.
	> 
	> “Liberty is a self-destroying technique of cosmic existence when its motivation is unintelligent, unconditioned, and uncontrolled. True liberty is progressively related to reality and is ever regardful of social equity, cosmic fairness, universe fraternity, and divine obligations.
	> 
	> “Liberty is suicidal when divorced from material justice, intellectual fairness, social forbearance, moral duty, and spiritual values. Liberty is nonexistent apart from cosmic reality, and all personality reality is proportional to its divinity relationships.
	> 
	> “Unbridled self-will and unregulated self-expression equal unmitigated selfishness, the acme of ungodliness. Liberty without the associated and ever-increasing conquest of self is a figment of egoistic mortal imagination. Self-motivated liberty is a conceptual illusion, a cruel deception. License masquerading in the garments of liberty is the forerunner of abject bondage.” <a id="s1332_379"></a>[UB 54:1.1-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_1)

2. Three hundred fifty thousand years of evolutionary progress were lost.

	> “By fifty thousand years after the collapse of the planetary administration, earthly affairs were so disorganized and retarded that the human race had gained very little over the general evolutionary status existing at the time of Caligastia’s arrival three hundred and fifty thousand years previously. In certain respects progress had been made; in other directions much ground had been lost.” <a id="s1336_398"></a>[UB 67:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_3)

3. The rebellion deprived the mortal races of much of the benefit of the Adamic inheritance.

	> “Sin on Urantia did very little to delay biologic evolution, but it did operate to deprive the mortal races of the full benefit of the Adamic inheritance. Sin enormously retards intellectual development, moral growth, social progress, and mass spiritual attainment. But it does not prevent the highest spiritual achievement by any individual who chooses to know God and sincerely do his divine will.” <a id="s1340_404"></a>[UB 67:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_3)

#### B. Eugenics—race problems.

1. It is neither wise nor altruistic to perpetuate the lowest of the inferior human stocks.

	> “It is neither tenderness nor altruism to bestow futile sympathy upon degenerated human beings, unsalvable abnormal and inferior mortals. There exist on even the most normal of the evolutionary worlds sufficient differences between individuals and between numerous social groups to provide for the full exercise of all those noble traits of altruistic sentiment and unselfish mortal ministry without perpetuating the socially unfit and the morally degenerate strains of evolving humanity. There is abundant opportunity for the exercise of tolerance and the function of altruism in behalf of those unfortunate and needy individuals who have not irretrievably lost their moral heritage and forever destroyed their spiritual birthright.” <a id="s1346_738"></a>[UB 52:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_12)

2. The Adamic progeny mate only with the higher and selected racial strains.

	> “This age usually witnesses the completion of the elimination of the unfit and the still further purification of the racial strains; on normal worlds the defective bestial tendencies are very nearly eliminated from the reproducing stocks of the realm.
	> 
	> “The Adamic progeny never amalgamate with the inferior strains of the evolutionary races. Neither is it the divine plan for the Planetary Adam or Eve to mate, personally, with the evolutionary peoples. This race-improvement project is the task of their progeny. But the offspring of the Material Son and Daughter are mobilized for generations before the racial-amalgamation ministry is inaugurated.” <a id="s1352_403"></a>[UB 52:3.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_4)

3. It would be folly to undertake broad-scale interracial mixtures at the present time.

	> “But while the pure-line children of a planetary Garden of Eden can bestow themselves upon the superior members of the evolutionary races and thereby upstep the biologic level of mankind, it would not prove beneficial for the higher strains of Urantia mortals to mate with the lower races; such an unwise procedure would jeopardize all civilization on your world. Having failed to achieve race harmonization by the Adamic technique, you must now work out your planetary problem of race improvement by other and largely human methods of adaptation and control.” <a id="s1356_564"></a>[UB 51:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5_7)

4. Race blending favors appearance of new characteristics—superior, if the stocks are superior.

	> “Race blending greatly contributes to the sudden appearance of _new_ characteristics, and if such hybridization is the union of superior strains, then these new characteristics will also be _superior_ traits.” <a id="s1360_213"></a>[UB 82:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p6_6)

5. The pros and cons of the intermingling of present-day human races.

	> “As long as present-day races are so overloaded with inferior and degenerate strains, race intermingling on a large scale would be most detrimental, but most of the objections to such experiments rest on social and cultural prejudices rather than on biological considerations. Even among inferior stocks, hybrids often are an improvement on their ancestors. Hybridization makes for species improvement because of the role of the _dominant genes_. Racial intermixture increases the likelihood of a larger number of the desirable _dominants_ being present in the hybrid.” <a id="s1364_573"></a>[UB 82:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p6_7)

6. No more new human races will appear on Urantia. Scientific supervision could greatly improve present-day human races.

	> “Mankind on Urantia must solve its problems of mortal development with the human stocks it has—no more races will evolve from prehuman sources throughout all future time. But this fact does not preclude the possibility of the attainment of vastly higher levels of human development through the intelligent fostering of the evolutionary potentials still resident in the mortal races. That which we, the Life Carriers, do toward fostering and conserving the life strains before the appearance of human will, man must do for himself after such an event and subsequent to our retirement from active participation in evolution. In a general way, man’s evolutionary destiny is in his own hands, and scientific intelligence must sooner or later supersede the random functioning of uncontrolled natural selection and chance survival.” <a id="s1368_830"></a>[UB 65:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p3_6)

#### C. Health problems.

1. Urantia scientists must work to compensate for the loss through default of resistance to disease.

	> “The body cells of the Material Sons and their progeny are far more resistant to disease than are those of the evolutionary beings indigenous to the planet. The body cells of the native races are akin to the living disease-producing microscopic and ultramicroscopic organisms of the realm. These facts explain why the Urantia peoples must do so much by way of scientific effort to withstand so many physical disorders. You would be far more disease resistant if your races carried more of the the Adamic life.<a id="s1374_512"></a>[UB 76:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_7)

## SECTION 6. THE RACES OF URANTIA AFTER THE SECOND GARDEN

### I. Racial and Cultural Distribution

> “The second Eden was the cradle of civilization for almost thirty thousand years. Here in Mesopotamia the Adamic peoples held forth, sending out their progeny to the ends of the earth, and jatterly, as amalgamated with the Nodite and Sangik tribes, were known as the Andites. From this region went those men and women who initiated the doings of historic times, and who have so enormously accelerated cultural progress on Urantia.” <a id="s1380_434"></a>[UB 78:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p0_1)

#### A. Summary of racial and cultural distribution thirty-five thousand years ago.

> “Adam and Eve also contributed much that was of value to the social, moral, and intellectual progress of mankind; civilization was immensely quickened by the presence of their offspring. But thirty-five thousand years ago the world at large possessed little culture. Certain centers of civilization existed here and there, but most of Urantia languished in savagery. Racial and cultural distribution was as follows:
> “1. _The violet race—Adamites and Adamsonites_. The chief center of Adamite culture was in the second garden, located in the triangle of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; this was indeed the cradle of Occidental and Indian civilizations. The secondary or northern center of the violet race was the Adamsonite headquarters, situated east of the southern shore of the Caspian Sea near the Kopet mountains. From these two centers there went forth to the surrounding lands the culture and life plasm which so immediately quickened all the races.
> “2. _Pre-Sumerians and other Nodites_. There were also present in Mesopotamia, near the mouth of the rivers, remnants of the ancient culture of the days of Dalamatia. With the passing millenniums, this group became thoroughly admixed with the Adamites to the north, but they never entirely lost their Nodite traditions. Various other Nodite groups that had settled in the Levant were, in general, absorbed by the later expanding violet race.
> “3. _The Andonites_ maintained five or six fairly representative settlements to the north and east of the Adamson headquarters. They were also scattered throughout Turkestan, while isolated islands of them persisted throughout Eurasia, especially in mountainous regions. These aborigines still held the northlands of the Eurasian continent, together with Iceland and Greenland, but they had long since been driven from the plains of Europe by the blue man and from the river valleys of farther Asia by the expanding yellow race.
> “4. _The red man_ occupied the Americas, having been driven out of Asia over fifty thousand years before the arrival of Adam.
> “5. _The yellow race_. The Chinese peoples were well established in control of eastern Asia. Their most advanced settlements were situated to the northwest of modern China in regions bordering on Tibet.
> “6. _The blue race_. The blue men were scattered all over Europe, but their better centers of culture were situated in the then fertile valleys of the Mediterranean basin and in northwestern Europe. Neanderthal absorption had greatly retarded the culture of the blue man, but he was otherwise the most aggressive, adventurous, and exploratory of all the evolutionary peoples of Eurasia.
> “7. _Pre-Dravidian India_. The complex mixture of races in India-embracing every race on earth, but especially the green, orange, and black—maintained a culture slightly above that of the outlying regions.
> “8. _The Sahara civilization_. The superior elements of the indigo race had their most progressive settlements in what is now the great Sahara desert. This indigo-black group carried extensive strains of the submerged orange and green races.
> “9. _The Mediterranean basin_. The most highly blended race outside of India occupied what is now the Mediterranean basin. Here blue men from the north and Saharans from the south met and mingled with Nodites and Adamites from the east.” <a id="s1393_240"></a>[UB 78:1.2-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p1_2)

### II. **The Adamites**

#### A. Nature and culture.

1. The heroism of the early Adamites constitutes an inspiring chapter of Urantia history.

	> “Adam and Eve had left behind a limited but potent progeny, and the celestial observers on Urantia waited anxiously to find out how these descendants of the erring Material Son and Daughter would acquit themselves.” <a id="s1401_219"></a>[UB 78:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p1_13)

	> “The heroism displayed in the leadership of the second garden constitutes one of the amazing and inspiring epics of Urantia’s history. These splendid souls never wholly lost sight of the purpose of the Adamic mission, and therefore did they valiantly fight off the influences of the surrounding and inferior tribes while they willingly sent forth their choicest sons and daughters in a steady stream as emissaries to the races of earth. Sometimes this expansion was depleting to the home culture, but always these superior peoples would rehabilitate themselves.” <a id="s1403_566"></a>[UB 78:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p2_2)

2. The civilization of the Adamites was comparatively high, but was not evolved, and therefore was doomed to deterioration.

	> “The civilization, society, and cultural status of the Adamites were far above the general level of the evolutionary races of Urantia. Only among the old settlements of Van and Amadon and the Adamsonites was there a civilization in anyway comparable. But the civilization of the second Eden was an artifical structure-_it had not been evolved_—and was therefore doomed to deteriorate until it reached a natural evolutionary level.” <a id="s1407_435"></a>[UB 78:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p2_3)

	> “But the Adamites were a real nation around 19,000 B.C., numbering four and a half million, and already they had poured forth millions of their progeny into the surrounding peoples.” <a id="s1409_186"></a>[UB 78:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p2_5)

#### B. Early expansions.

1. The violet race did not attempt territorial conquest, but sent forth teachers.

	> “The violet race retained the Edenic traditions of peacefulness for many millenniums, which explains their long delay in making territorial conquests. When they suffered from population pressure, instead of making war to secure more territory, they sent forth their excess inhabitants as teachers to the other races. The cultural effect of these earlier migrations was not enduring, but the absorption of the Adamite teachers, traders, and explorers was biologically invigorating to the surrounding peoples.” <a id="s1415_512"></a>[UB 78:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p3_1)

2. The expansion of the Adamites was generally north and west.

	> “Some of the Adamites early journeyed westward to the valley of the Nile; others penetrated eastward into Asia, but these were a minority. The mass movement of the later days was extensively northward and thence westward. It was, in the main, a gradual but unremitting northward push, the greater number making their way north and then circling westward around the Caspian Sea into Europe.
	> 
	> “About twenty-five thousand years ago many of the purer elements of the Adamites were well on their northern trek. And as they penetrated northward, they became less and less Adamic until, by the times of their occupation of Turkestan, they had become thoroughly admixed with the other races, particularly the Nodites. Very few of the pure-line violet peoples ever penetrated far into Europe or Asia.” <a id="s1421_405"></a>[UB 78:3.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p3_2)

### III. **The Andites**

> “The Andite races were the primary blends of the pure-line violet race and the Nodites plus the evolutionary peoples. In general, Andites should be thought of as having a far greater percentage of Adamic blood than the modern races. In the main, the term Andite is used to designate those peoples whose racial inheritance was from one-eighth to one-sixth violet. Modern Urantians, even the northern white races, contain much less than this percentage of the blood of Adam.” <a id="s1425_476"></a>[UB 78:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p4_1)

1. Andite peoples took origin around Mesopotamia.

	> “The earliest Andite peoples took origin in the regions adjacent to Mesopotamia more than twenty-five thousand years ago and consisted of a blend of the Adamites and Nodites. The second garden was surrounded by concentric circles of diminishing violet blood, and it was on the periphery of this racial melting pot that the Andite race was born. Later on, when the migrating Adamites and Nodites entered the then fertile regions of Turkestan, they soon blended with the superior inhabitants, and the resultant race mixture extended the Andite type northward.” <a id="s1429_562"></a>[UB 78:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p4_2)

2. The Andites were the best all-round human stock since the violet people. They were neither Occidental nor Oriental.

	> “The Andites were the best all-round human stock to appear on Urantia since the days of the pure-line violet peoples. They embraced most of the highest types of the surviving remnants of the Adamite and Nodite races and, later, some of the best strains of the yellow, blue, and green men.
	> 
	> “These early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. They were not white; they were pre-white. They were neither an Occidental nor an Oriental people. But it is Andite inheritance that gives to the polyglot mixture of the so-called white races that generalized homogeneity which has been called Caucasoid.” <a id="s1435_315"></a>[UB 78:4.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p4_3)

3. The Andites were skillful militarists; they were adventurous.

	> “The purer strains of the violet race had retained the Adamic tradition of peace-seeking, which explains why the earlier race movements had been more in the nature of peaceful migrations. But as the Adamites united with the Nodite stocks, who were by this time a belligerent race, their Andite descendants became, for their day and age, the most skillful and sagacious militarists ever to live on Urantia. Thenceforth the movements of the Mesopotamians grew increasingly military in character and became more akin to actual conquests.
	> 
	> “These Andites were adventurous; they had roving dispositions. An increase of either Sangik or Andonite stock tended to stabilize them. But even so, their later descendants never stopped until they had circumnavigated the globe and discovered the last remote continent.” <a id="s1441_274"></a>[UB 78:4.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p4_5)

4. Infusion of Adamic stock quickened civilization and stimulated adventure and exploration.

	> “Infusion of the Adamic stock into the human races not only quickened the pace of civilization, but it also greatly stimulated their proclivities toward adventure and exploration to the end that most of Eurasia and northern Africa was presently occupied by the rapidly multiplying mixed descendants of the Andites.” <a id="s1445_319"></a>[UB 81:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_8)

#### B. Early Andite migrations.

1. The culture of the second garden declined until about 15,000 B.C. when a great renaissance took place.

	> “For twenty thousand years the culture of the second garden persisted, but it experienced a steady decline until about 15,000 B.C., when the regeneration of the Sethite priesthood and the leadership of Amosad inaugurated a brilliant era. The massive waves of civilization which later spread over Eurasia immediately followed the great renaissance of the Garden consequent upon the extensive union of the Adamites with the surrounding mixed Nodites to form the Andites.” <a id="s1451_473"></a>[UB 78:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_1)

2. Andites upstepped the civilizations of Turkestan, Europe, China, and India. A few reached Japan, Formosa, and the East Indies.

	> “The civilization of Turkestan was constantly being revived and refreshed by the newcomers from Mesopotamia, especially by the later Andite cavalrymen. The so-called Aryan mother tongue was in process of formation in the highlands of Turkestan; it was a blend of the Andonic dialect of that region with the language of the Adamsonites and later Andites. Many modern languages are derived from this early speech of these central Asian tribes who conquered Europe, India, and the upper stretches of the Mesopotamian plains. This ancient language gave the Occidental tongues all of that similarity which is called Aryan.
	> 
	> “By 12,000 B.C. three quarters of the Andite stock of the world was resident in northern and eastern Europe, and when the later and final exodus from Mesopotamia took place, sixty-five per cent of these last waves of emigration entered Europe.
	> 
	> “The Andites not only migrated to Europe but to northern China and India, while many groups penetrated to the ends of the earth as missionaries, teachers, and traders. They contributed considerably to the northern groups of the Saharan Sangik peoples. But only a few teachers and traders ever penetrated farther south in Africa than the headwaters of the Nile. Later on, mixed Andites and Egyptians followed down both the east and west coasts of Africa well below the equator, but they did not reach Madagascar.
	> 
	> “These Andites were the so-called Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of India; and their presence in central Asia greatly upstepped the ancestors of the Turanians. Many of this race journeyed to China by way of both Sinkiang and Tibet and added desirable qualities to the later Chinese stocks. From time to time small groups made their way into Japan, Formosa, the East Indies, and southern China, though very few entered southern China by the coastal route.” <a id="s1461_465"></a>[UB 78:5.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_3)

3. Some reached the Polynesian islands and South America and helped establish the ancestry of the Incas.

	> “One hundred and thirty-two of this race, embarking in a fleet of small boats from Japan, eventually reached South America and by intermarriage with the natives of the Andes established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. They crossed the Pacific by easy stages, tarrying on the many islands they found along the way. The islands of the Polynesian group were both more numerous and larger then than now, and these Andite sailors, together with some who followed them, biologically modified the native groups in transit. Many flourishing centers of civilization grew up on these now submerged lands as a result of Andite penetration. Easter Island was long a religious and administrative center of one of these lost groups. But of the Andites who navigated the Pacific of long ago none but the one hundred and thirty-two ever reached the mainland of the Americas.” <a id="s1465_878"></a>[UB 78:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_7)

4. Andites contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture.

	> “The migratory conquests of the Andites continued on down to their final dispersions, from 8000 to 6000 B.C. As they poured out of Mesopotamia, they continuously depleted the biologic reserves of their homelands while markedly strengthening the surrounding peoples. And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture. They were skillful domesticators of animals and expert agriculturists. For the time being, at least, their presence usually improved the religious beliefs and moral practices of the older races. And so the culture of Mesopotamia quietly spread out over Europe, India, China, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands.” <a id="s1469_696"></a>[UB 78:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p5_8)

#### C. Later Andite migrations.

1. Three waves of Andites poured out of Mesopotamia between 8000 and 6000 B.C.

	> “The last three waves of Andites poured out of Mesopotamia between 8000 and 6000 B.C. These three great waves of culture were forced out of Mesopotamia by the pressure of the hill tribes to the east and the harassment of the plainsmen of the west. The inhabitants of the Euphrates valley and adjacent territory went forth in their final exodus in several directions:
	> 
	> “Sixty-five per cent entered Europe by the Caspian Sea route to conquer and amalgamate with the newly appearing white races—the blend of the blue men and the earlier Andites.
	> 
	> “Ten per cent, including a large group of the Sethite priests, moved eastward through the Elamite highlands to the Iranian plateau and Turkestan. Many of their descendants were later driven into India with their Aryan brethren from the regions to the north.
	> 
	> “Ten per cent of the Mesopotamians turned eastward in their northern trek, entering Sinkiang, where they blended with the Anditeyellow inhabitants. The majority of the able offspring of this racial union later entered China and contributed much to the immediate improvement of the northern division of the yellow race.
	> 
	> “Ten per cent of these fleeing Andites made their way across Arabia and entered Egypt.
	> 
	> “Five per cent of the Andites, the very superior culture of the coastal district about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates who had kept themselves free from intermarriage with the inferior neighboring tribesmen, refused to leave their homes. This group represented the survival of many superior Nodite and Adamite strains.” <a id="s1485_330"></a>[UB 78:6.1-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p6_1)

2. Floods in Mesopotamia, particularly the one during the days of Noah, completed the disruption of Andite civilization, and destroyed the second garden.

	> “The river dwellers were accustomed to rivers overflowing their banks at certain seasons; these periodic floods were annual events in their lives. But new perils threatened the valley of Mesopotamia as a result of progressive geologic changes to the north.
	> 
	> “For thousands of years after the submergence of the first Eden the mountains about the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and those to the northwest and northeast of Mesopotamia continued to rise. This elevation of the highlands was greatly accelerated about 5000 B.C., and this, together with greatly increased snowfall on the northern mountains, caused unprecedented floods each spring throughout the Euphrates valley. These spring floods grew increasingly worse so that eventually the inhabitants of the river regions were driven to the eastern highlands. For almost a thousand years scores of cities were practically deserted because of these extensive deluges.
	> 
	> “Almost five thousand years later, as the Hebrew priests in Babylonian captivity sought to trace the Jewish people back to Adam, they found great difficulty in piecing the story together; and it occurred to one of them to abandon the effort, to let the whole world drown in its wickedness at the time of Noah’s flood, and thus to be in a better position to trace Abraham right back to one of the three surviving sons of Noah.” <a id="s1493_430"></a>[UB 78:7.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_1)

	> “These floods completed the disruption of Andite civilization. With the ending of this period of deluge, the second garden was no more. Only in the south and among the Sumerians did any trace of the former glory remain.
	> 
	> “The remnants of this, one of the oldest civilizations, are to be found in these regions of Mesopotamia and to the northeast and northwest. But still older vestiges of the days of Dalamatia exist under the waters of the Persian Gulf, and the first Eden lies submerged under the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea.” <a id="s1497_320"></a>[UB 78:7.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_6)

#### D. The Sumerians—last of the Andites.

1. The remnant of Andites in Mesopotamia constituted the Sumerians.

	> “When the last Andite dispersion broke the biologic backbone of Mesopotamian civilization, a small minority of this superior race remained in their homeland near the mouths of the rivers. These were the Sumerians, and by 6000 B.C. they had become largely Andite in extraction, though their culture was more exclusively Nodite in character, and they clung to the ancient traditions of Dalamatia. Nonetheless, these Sumerians of the coastal regions were the last of the Andites in Mesopotamia. But the races of Mesopotamia were already thoroughly blended by this late date, as is evidenced by the skull types found in the graves of this era.<a id="s1503_642"></a>[UB 78:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_1)

2. Barbarians from Turkestan and Iran overran all Mesopotamia, assimilating the remaining Andites, and developed into the mixed people who were the ancestors of the Babylonians.

	> “The peaceful grain growers of the Euphrates and Tigris valleys had long been harassed by the raids of the barbarians of Turkestan and the Iranian plateau. But now a concerted invasion of the Euphrates valley was brought about by the increasing drought of the highland pastures. And this invasion was all the more serious because these surrounding herdsmen and hunters possessed large numbers of tamed horses. It was the possession of horses which gave them a tremendous military advantage over their rich neighbors to the south. In a short time they overran all Mesopotamia, driving forth the last waves of culture which spread out over all of Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.
	> 
	> “These conquerors of Mesopotamia carried in their ranks many of the better Andite strains of the mixed northern races of Turkestan, including some of the Adamson stock. These less advanced but more vigorous tribes from the north quickly and willingly assimilated the residue of the civilization of Mesopotamia and presently developed into those mixed peoples found in the Euphrates valley at the beginning of historic annals. They quickly revived many phases of the passing civilization of Mesopotamia, adopting the arts of the valley tribes and much of the culture of the Sumerians. They even sought to build a third tower of Babel and later adopted the term as their national name.” <a id="s1509_688"></a>[UB 78:8.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_3)

3. About 2500 B.C. the Sumerians were defeated and absorbed into the ranks of the Semites. The Garden culture yielded the ferments which have produced present-day civilization.

	> “About 2500 B.C. the Sumerians suffered severe reverses at the hands of the northern Suites and Guites. Lagash, the Sumerian capital built on flood mounds, fell. Erech held out for thirty years after the fall of Akkad. By the time of the establishment of the rule of Hammurabi the Sumerians had become absorbed into the ranks of the northern Semites, and the Mesopotamian Andites passed from the pages of history.” <a id="s1513_418"></a>[UB 78:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_10)

	> “And this is the story of the violet race after the days of Adam and of the fate of their homeland between the Tigris and Euphrates. Their ancient civilization finally fell due to the emigration of superior peoples and the immigration of their inferior neighbors. But long before the barbarian cavalrymen conquered the valley, much of the Garden culture had spread to Asia, Africa, and Europe, there to produce the ferments which have resulted in the twentiethcentury civilization of Urantia.” <a id="s1515_497"></a>[UB 78:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_12)

### IV. **Andite Expansion in the Orient**

> “Asia is the homeland of the human race. It was on a southern peninsula of this continent that Andon and Fonta were born; in the highlands of what is now Afghanistan, their descendant Badonan founded a primitive center of culture that persisted for over one-half million years. Here at this eastern focus of the human race the Sangik peoples differentiated from the Andonic stock, and Asia was their first home, their first hunting ground, their first battlefield. Southwestern Asia witnessed the successive civilizations of Dalamatians, Nodites, Adamites, and Andites, and from these regions the potentials of modern civilization spread to the world.” <a id="s1519_655"></a>[UB 79:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p0_1)

#### A. The Andites of Turkestan.

1. The Andites infiltrated Turkestan on their way to eastern Asia, Europe, and India.

	> “For over twenty-five thousand years, on down to nearly 2000 B.C., the heart of Eurasia was predominantly, though diminishingly, Andite. In the lowlands of Turkestan the Andites made the westward turning around the inland lakes into Europe, while from the highlands of this region they infiltrated eastward. Eastern Turkestan (Sinkiang) and, to a lesser extent, Tibet were the ancient gateways through which these peoples of Mesopotamia penetrated the mountains to the northern lands of the yellow men. The Andite infiltration of India proceeded from the Turkestan highlands into the Punjab and from the Iranian grazing lands through Baluchistan. These earlier migrations were in no sense conquests; they were, rather, the continual drifting of the Andite tribes into western India and China.” <a id="s1525_797"></a>[UB 79:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_1)

2. Increasing aridity drove the Andites southward and caused them to become traders and to build cities.

	> “By 8000 B.C. the slowly increasing aridity of the highland regions of central Asia began to drive the Andites to the river bottoms and the seashores. This increasing drought not only drove them to the valleys of the Nile, Euphrates, Indus, and Yellow rivers, but it produced a new development in Andite civilization. A new class of men, the traders, began to appear in large numbers.
	> 
	> “When climatic conditions made hunting unprofitable for the migrating Andites, they did not follow the evolutionary course of the older races by becoming herders. Commerce and urban life made their appearance. From Egypt through Mesopotamia and Turkestan to the rivers of China and India, the more highly civilized tribes began to assemble in cities devoted to manufacture and trade. Adonia became the central Asian commercial metropolis, being located near the present city of Ashkhabad. Commerce in stone, metal, wood, and pottery was accelerated on both land and water.” <a id="s1531_577"></a>[UB 79:1.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_3)

3. Even in more recent times there is evidence of Andite blood among the Asiatic peoples.

	> “But even in the twentieth century after Christ there are traces of Andite blood among the Turanian and Tibetan peoples, as is witnessed by the blond types occasionally found in these regions. The early Chinese annals record the presence of the red-haired nomads to the north of the peaceful settlements of the Yellow River, and there still remain paintings which faithfully record the presence of both the blond-Andite and the brunet-Mongolian types in the Tarim basin of long ago.
	> 
	> “The last great manifestation of the submerged military genius of the central Asiatic Andites was in A.D. 1200, when the Mongols under Genghis Khan began the conquest of the greater portion of the Asiatic continent. And like the Andites of old, these warriors proclaimed the existence of ‘one God in heaven.’ The early breakup of their empire long delayed cultural intercourse between Occident and Orient and greatly handicapped the growth of the monotheistic concept in Asia.” <a id="s1537_481"></a>[UB 79:1.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_8)

#### B. The Andites in India.

1. India is the only locality where all the Urantia races were blended.

	> “India is the only locality where all the Urantia races were blended, the Andite invasion adding the last stock. In the highlands northwest of India the Sangik races came into existence, and without exception members of each penetrated the subcontinent of India in their early days, leaving behind them the most heterogeneous race mixture ever to exist on Urantia. Ancient India acted as a catch basin for the migrating races. The base of the peninsula was formerly somewhat narrower than now, much of the deltas of the Ganges and Indus being the work of the last fifty thousand years.” <a id="s1543_590"></a>[UB 79:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_1)

2. About 15,000 B.C. population pressure in Turkestan caused the Andites to move into India. The topography of India prevented inferior stocks from emigrating; the Andites, despite a desperate attempt to preserve their identity, became submerged, but the whole mass of people had been improved.

	> “About 15,000 B.C. increasing population pressure throughout Turkestan and Iran occasioned the first really extensive Andite movement toward India. For over fifteen centuries these superior peoples poured in through the highlands of Baluchistan, spreading out over the valleys of the Indus and Ganges and slowly moving southward into the Deccan. This Andite pressure from the northwest drove many of the southern and eastern inferiors into Burma and southern China but not sufficiently to save the invaders from racial obliteration.
	> 
	> “The failure of India to achieve the hegemony of Eurasia was largely a matter of topography; population pressure from the north only crowded the majority of the people southward into the decreasing territory of the Deccan, surrounded on all sides by the sea. Had there been adjacent lands for emigration, then would the inferiors have been crowded out in all directions, and the superior stocks would have achieved a higher civilization.
	> 
	> “As it was, these earlier Andite conquerors made a desperate attempt to preserve their identity and stem the tide of racial engulfment by the establishment of rigid restrictions regarding intermarriage. Nonetheless, the Andites had become submerged by 10,000 B.C., but the whole mass of the people had been markedly improved by this absorption.” <a id="s1551_349"></a>[UB 79:2.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_4)

3. Andite admixture with the native stock of India produced the Dravidians, who did much to elevate the social and religious levels of the inhabitants of India.

	> “The blending of the Andite conquerors of India with the native stock eventually resulted in that mixed people which has been called Dravidian. The earlier and purer Dravidians possessed a great capacity for cultural achievement, which was continuously weakened as their Andite inheritance became progressively attenuated. And this is what doomed the budding civilization of India almost twelve thousand years ago. But the infusion of even this small amount of the blood of Adam produced a marked acceleration in social development. This composite stock immediately produced the most versatile civilization then on earth.” <a id="s1555_626"></a>[UB 79:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_1)

	> “The superior culture and religious leanings of the peoples of India date from the early times of Dravidian domination and are due, in part, to the fact that so many of the Sethite priesthood entered India, both in the earlier Andite and in the later Aryan invasions. The thread of monotheism running through the religious history of India thus stems from the teachings of the Adamites in the second garden.” <a id="s1557_412"></a>[UB 79:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_3)

	> “But for more than seven thousand years, down to the end of the Andite migrations, the religious status of the inhabitants of India was far above that of the world at large. During these times India bid fair to produce the leading cultural, religious, philosophic, and commercial civilization of the world. And but for the complete submergence of the Andites by the peoples of the south, this destiny would probably have been realized.” <a id="s1559_440"></a>[UB 79:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_5)

	> “The Dravidians were among the earliest peoples to build cities and to engage in an extensive export and import business, both by land and sea. By 7000 B.C. camel trains were making regular trips to distant Mesopotamia; Dravidian shipping was pushing coastwise across the Arabian Sea to the Sumerian cities of the Persian Gulf and was venturing on the waters of the Bay of Bengal as far as the East Indies. An alphabet, together with the art of writing, was imported from Sumeria by these seafarers and merchants.” <a id="s1561_518"></a>[UB 79:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_7)

4. The second Andite penetration, the Aryan invasion, upstepped the northern part of India, but amalgamation with inferior natives, in spite of the caste system, resulted in an inferior civilization.

	> “The second Andite penetration of India was the Aryan invasion during a period of almost five hundred years in the middle of the third millennium before Christ. This migration marked the terminal exodus of the Andites from their homelands in Turkestan.
	> 
	> “The early Aryan centers were scattered over the northern half of India, notably in the northwest. These invaders never completed the conquest of the country and subsequently met their undoing in this neglect since their lesser numbers made them vulnerable to absorption by the Dravidians of the south, who subsequently overran the entire peninsula except the Himalayan provinces.” <a id="s1567_385"></a>[UB 79:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p4_1)

	> “On the Gangetic plain Aryan and Dravidian eventually mingled to produce a high culture, and this center was later reinforced by contributions from the northeast, coming from China.” <a id="s1569_186"></a>[UB 79:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p4_4)

	> “When the Aryans entered India, they brought with them their concepts of Deity as they had been preserved in the lingering traditions of the religion of the second garden. But the Brahman priests were never able to withstand the pagan momentum built up by the sudden contact with the inferior religions of the the vast majority of the population fell into the bondage of the enslaving superstitions of inferior religions; and so it was that India failed to produce the high civilization which had been foreshadowed in earlier times.” <a id="s1571_537"></a>[UB 79:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p4_7)

#### C. The Andites and the yellow races of China.

1. Enough of the Andites migrated to northern centers of culture in China to stimulate their civilization.

	> “About fifteen thousand years ago the Andites, in considerable numbers, were traversing the pass of Ti Tao and spreading out over the upper valley of the Yellow River among the Chinese settlements of Kansu. Presently they penetrated eastward to Honan, where the most progressive settlements were situated. This infiltration from the west was about half Andonite and half Andite.
	> 
	> “The northern centers of culture along the Yellow River had always been more progressive than the southern settlements on the Yangtze. Within a few thousand years after the arrival of even the small numbers of these superior mortals, the settlements along the Yellow River had forged ahead of the Yangtze villages and had achieved an advanced position over their brethren in the south which has ever since been maintained.
	> 
	> “It was not that there were so many of the Andites, nor that their culture was so superior, but amalgamation with them produced a more versatile stock. The northern Chinese received just enough of the Andite strain to mildly stimulate their innately able minds but not enough to fire them with the restless, exploratory curiosity so characteristic of the northern white races. This more limited infusion of Andite inheritance was less disturbing to the innate stability of the Sangik type.” <a id="s1581_494"></a>[UB 79:7.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p7_1)

2. The lack of stimulus of danger, and the Chinese tendencies toward agriculture, led to ancestor worship and comparative stagnation.

	> “While the red man suffered from too much warfare, it is not altogether amiss to say that the development of statehood among the Chinese was delayed by the thoroughness of their conquest of Asia. They had a great potential of racial solidarity, but it failed properly to develop because the continuous driving stimulus of the ever-present danger of external aggression was lacking.
	> 
	> “With the completion of the conquest of eastern Asia the ancient military state gradually disintegrated—past wars were forgotten. Of the epic struggle with the red race there persisted only the hazy tradition of an ancient contest with the archer peoples. The Chinese early turned to agricultural pursuits, which contributed further to their pacific tendencies, while a population well below the land-man ratio for agriculture still further contributed to the growing peacefulness of the country.
	> 
	> “Consciousness of past achievements (somewhat diminished in the present), the conservatism of an overwhelmingly agricultural people, and a well-developed family life equaled the birth of ancestor veneration, culminating in the custom of so honoring the men of the past as to border on worship. A very similar attitude prevailed among the white races in Europe for some five hundred years following the disruption of Graeco-Roman civilization.
	> 
	> “The belief in, and worship of, the ‘One Truth’ as taught by Singlangton never entirely died out; but as time passed, the search for new and higher truth became overshadowed by a growing tendency to venerate that which was already established. Slowly the genius of the yellow race became diverted from the pursuit of the unknown to the preservation of the known. And this is the reason for the stagnation of what had been the world’s most rapidly progressing civilization.” <a id="s1591_477"></a>[UB 79:8.1-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_1)

3. Though several factors delayed the development of statehood among the Chinese, they have caused the development of family life which helped produce the stability of the Chinese.

	> “Between 4000 and 500 B.C. the political reunification of the yellow race was consummated, but the cultural union of the Yangtze and Yellow river centers had already been effected. This political reunification of the later tribal groups was not without conflict, but the societal opinion of war remained low; ancestor worship, increasing dialects, and no call for military action for thousands upon thousands of years had rendered this people ultrapeaceful.” <a id="s1595_462"></a>[UB 79:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_5)

	> “The great weakness of ancestor veneration is that it promotes a backward-looking philosophy. However wise it may be to glean wisdom from the past, it is folly to regard the past as the exclusive source of truth. Truth is relative and expanding; it _lives_ always in the present, achieving new expression in each generation of men—even in each human life.
	> 
	> “The great strength in a veneration of ancestry is the value that such an attitude places upon the family. The amazing stability and persistence of Chinese culture is a consequence of the paramount position accorded the family, for civilization is directly dependent on the effective functioning of the family; and in China the family attained a social importance, even a religious significance, approached by few other peoples.” <a id="s1599_433"></a>[UB 79:8.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_8)

	> “And so the ancient civilization of the yellow race has persisted down through the centuries. It is almost forty thousand years since the first important advances were made in Chinese culture, and though there have been many retrogressions, the civilization of the sons of Han comes the nearest of all to presenting an unbroken picture of continual progression right on down to the times of the twentieth century. The mechanical and religious developments of the white races have been of a high order, but they have never excelled the Chinese in family loyalty, group ethics, or personal morality.
	> 
	> “This ancient culture has contributed much to human happiness; millions of human beings have lived and died, blessed by its achievements. For centuries this great civilization has rested upon the laurels of the past, but it is even now reawakening to envision anew the transcendent goals of mortal existence, once again to take up the unremitting struggle for never-ending progress.” <a id="s1603_387"></a>[UB 79:8.16-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_16)

### V. **Andite Expansion in the Occident**

> “Although the European blue man did not of himself achieve a great cultural civilization, he did supply the biologic foundation which, when its Adamized strains were blended with the later Andite invaders, produced one of the most potent stocks for the attainment of aggressive civilization ever to appear on Urantia since the times of the violet race and their Andite successors.
> 
> “The modern white peoples incorporate the surviving strains of the Adamic stock which became admixed with the Sangik races, some red and yellow but more especially the blue. There is a considerable percentage of the original Andonite stock in all the white races and still more of the early Nodite strains.” <a id="s1609_310"></a>[UB 80:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p0_1)

#### A. The Andites along the Nile.

1. The Adamites and Andites found Nodite centers of civilization in Egypt. A stream of Mesopotamians for 30,000 years enriched the civilization of the Nile valley, though the ingress of large numbers of black Saharans greatly deteriorated the culture.

	> “Before the last Andites were driven out of the Euphrates valley, many of their brethren had entered Europe as adventurers, teachers, traders, and warriors. During the earlier days of the violet race the Mediterranean trough was protected by the Gibraltar isthmus and the Sicilian land bridge. Some of man’s very early maritime commerce was established on these inland lakes, where blue men from the north and the Saharans from the south met Nodites and Adamites from the east.
	> 
	> “In the eastern trough of the Mediterranean the Nodites had established one of their most extensive cultures and from these centers had penetrated somewhat into southern Europe but more especially into northern Africa. The broad-headed Nodite-Andonite Syrians very early introduced pottery and agriculture in connection with their settlements on the slowly rising Nile delta. They also imported sheep, goats, cattle, and other domesticated animals and brought in greatly improved methods of metalworking, Syria then being the center of that industry.
	> 
	> “For more than thirty thousand years Egypt received a steady stream of Mesopotamians, who brought along their art and culture to enrich that of the Nile valley. But the ingress of large numbers of the Sahara peoples greatly deteriorated the early civilization along the Nile so that Egypt reached its lowest cultural level some fifteen thousand years ago.
	> 
	> “But during earlier times there was little to hinder the westward migration of the Adamites. The Sahara was an open grazing land overspread by herders and agriculturists. These Saharans never engaged in manufacture, nor were they city builders. They were an indigo-black group which carried extensive strains of the extinct green and orange races. But they received a very limited amount of the violet inheritance before the upthrust of land and the shifting water-laden winds dispersed the remnants of this prosperous and peaceful civilization.” <a id="s1621_550"></a>[UB 80:1.1-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_1)

2. After the terminal migration of Andites from Mesopotamia, Egypt became the headquarters of the most advanced group on earth.

	> “From the times of the terminal Andite migrations, culture declined in the Euphrates valley, and the immediate center of civilization shifted to the valley of the Nile. Egypt became the successor of Mesopotamia as the headquarters of the most advanced group on earth.
	> 
	> “The Nile valley began to suffer from floods shortly before the Mesopotamian valleys but fared much better. This early setback was more than compensated by the continuing stream of Andite immigrants, so that the culture of Egypt, though really derived from the Euphrates region, seemed to forge ahead. But in 5000 B.C., during the flood period in Mesopotamia, there were seven distinct groups of human beings in Egypt; all of them, save one, came from Mesopotamia.
	> 
	> “When the last exodus from the Euphrates valley occurred, Egypt was fortunate in gaining so many of the most skillful artists and artisans. These Andite artisans found themselves quite at home in that they were thoroughly familiar with river life, its floods, irrigations, and dry seasons. They enjoyed the sheltered position of the Nile valley; they were there much less subject to hostile raids and attacks than along the Euphrates. And they added greatly to the metalworking skill of the Egyptians. Here they worked iron ores coming from Mount Sinai instead of from the Black Sea regions.” <a id="s1629_596"></a>[UB 80:6.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p6_1)

3. The Andites built the first stone structures in Egypt, but internal warfare laid them open to invasion by the inferior tribes from Arabia and the south.

	> “The Egyptians very early assembled their municipal deities into an elaborate national system of gods. They developed an extensive theology and had an equally extensive but burdensome priesthood. Several different leaders sought to revive the remnants of the early religious teachings of the Sethites, but these endeavors were short-lived. The Andites built the first stone structures in Egypt. The first and most exquisite of the stone pyramids was erected by Imhotep, an Andite architectural genius, while serving as prime minister. Previous buildings had been constructed of brick, and while many stone structures had been erected in different parts of the world, this was the first in Egypt. But the art of building steadily declined from the days of this great architect.
	> 
	> “This brilliant epoch of culture was cut short by internal warfare along the Nile, and the country was soon overrun, as Mesopotamia had been, by the inferior tribes from inhospitable Arabia and by the blacks from the south. As a result, social progress steadily declined for more than five hundred years.” <a id="s1635_309"></a>[UB 80:6.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p6_4)

#### B. The Adamites and the blue race.

1. Geographic conditions coupled with sex attraction between the violet and blue races caused a migration of Adamites to Europe.

	> “Adam’s blood has been shared with most of the human races, but some secured more than others. The mixed races of India and the darker peoples of Africa were not attractive to the Adamites. They would have mixed freely with the red man had he not been far removed in the Americas, and they were kindly disposed toward the yellow man, but he was likewise difficult of access in faraway Asia. Therefore, when actuated by either adventure or altruism, or when driven out of the Euphrates valley, they very naturally chose union with the blue races of Europe.
	> 
	> “The blue men, then dominant in Europe, had no religious practices which were repulsive to the earlier migrating Adamites, and there was great sex attraction between the violet and the blue races. The best of the blue men deemed it a high honor to be permitted to mate with the Adamites. Every blue man entertained the ambition of becoming so skillful and artistic as to win the affection of some Adamite woman, and it was the highest aspiration of a superior blue woman to receive the attentions of an Adamite.
	> 
	> “Slowly these migrating sons of Eden united with the higher types of the blue race, invigorating their cultural practices while ruthlessly exterminating the Lingering strains of Neanderthal stock. This technique of race blending, combined with the elimination of inferior strains, produced a dozen or more virile and progressive groups of superior blue men, one of which you have denominated the Cro-Magnons.
	> 
	> “For these and other reasons, not the least of which was more favorable paths of migration, the early waves of Mesopotamian culture made their way almost exclusively to Europe. And it was these circumstances that determined the antecedents of modern European civilization.” <a id="s1647_277"></a>[UB 80:1.5-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_5)

2. The lowering of the Gibraltar isthmus and the Sicilian land bridge brought about the greatest flood in history and delayed the migration of Adamites into Europe.

	> “About the time of these climatic changes in Africa, England separated from the continent, and Denmark arose from the sea, while the isthmus of Gibraltar, protecting the western basin of the Mediterranean, gave way as the result of an earthquake, quickly raising this inland lake to the level of the Atlantic Ocean. Presently the Sicilian land bridge submerged, creating one sea of the Mediterranean and connecting it with the Atlantic Ocean. This cataclysm of nature flooded scores of human settlements and occasioned the greatest loss of life by flood in all the world’s history.
	> 
	> “This engulfment of the Mediterranean basin immediately curtailed the westward movements of the Adamites, while the great influx of Saharans led them to seek outlets for their increasing numbers to the north and east of Eden. As the descendants of Adam journeyed northward from the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, they encountered mountainous barriers and the then expanded Caspian Sea. And for many generations the Adamites hunted, herded, and tilled the soil around their settlements scattered throughout Turkestan. Slowly this magnificent people extended their territory into Europe. But now the Adamites enter Europe from the east and find the culture of the blue man thousands of years behind that of Asia since this region has been almost entirely out of touch with Mesopotamia.” <a id="s1653_794"></a>[UB 80:2.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_4)

#### C. The Andite invasions of Europe.

1. There were seven major invasions of Europe by Andites, interspersed with an invasion of Andonites.

	> “While the Andites poured into Europe in a steady stream, there were seven major invasions, the last arrivals coming on horseback in three great waves. Some entered Europe by way of the islands of the Aegean and up the Danube valley, but the majority of the earlier and purer strains migrated to northwestern Europe by the northern route across the grazing lands of the Volga and the Don.
	> 
	> “Between the third and fourth invasions a horde of Andonites entered Europe from the north, having come from Siberia by way of the Russian rivers and the Baltic. They were immediately assimilated by the northern Andite tribes.” <a id="s1661_231"></a>[UB 80:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p4_1)

2. The Adamites were pacific, the Nodites were belligerent; the union of these stocks with the Sangiks produced the aggressive Andites.

	> “The earlier expansions of the purer violet race were far more pacific than were those of their later semimilitary and conquestloving Andite descendants. The Adamites were pacific; the Nodites were belligerent. The union of these stocks, as later mingled with the Sangik races, produced the able, aggressive Andites who made actual military conquests.” <a id="s1665_356"></a>[UB 80:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p4_3)

3. The horse was an important factor in the Andite conquest of Europe.

	> “But the horse was the evolutionary factor which determined the dominance of the Andites in the Occident. The horse gave the dispersing Andites the hitherto nonexistent advantage of mobility, enabling the last groups of Andite cavalrymen to progress quickly around the Caspian Sea to overrun all of Europe. All previous waves of Andites had moved so slowly that they tended to disintegrate at any great distance from Mesopotamia. But these later waves moved so rapidly that they reached Europe as coherent groups, still retaining some measure of higher culture.
	> 
	> “The whole inhabited world, outside of China and the Euphrates region, had made very limited cultural progress for ten thousand years when the hard-riding Andite horsemen made their appearance in the sixth and seventh millenniums before Christ. As they moved westward across the Russian plains, absorbing the best of the blue man and exterminating the worst, they became blended into one people. These were the ancestors of the so-called Nordic races, the forefathers of the Scandinavian, German, and Anglo-Saxon peoples.
	> 
	> “It was not long before the superior blue strains had been fully absorbed by the Andites throughout all northern Europe. Only in Lapland (and to a certain extent in Brittany) did the older Andonites retain even a semblance of identity.” <a id="s1673_240"></a>[UB 80:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p4_4)

4. Tribes in northern Europe were continuously upstepped by Andites, but the blue men in the south resisted them.

	> “The tribes of northern Europe were being continuously reinforced and upstepped by the steady stream of migrants from Mesopotamia through the Turkestan-south Russian regions, and when the last waves of Andite cavalry swept over Europe, there were already more men with Andite inheritance in that region than were to be found in all the rest of the world.
	> 
	> “For three thousand years the military headquarters of the northern Andites was in Denmark. From this central point there went forth the successive waves of conquest, which grew decreasingly Andite and increasingly white as the passing centuries witnessed the final blending of the Mesopotamian conquerors with the conquered peoples.
	> 
	> “While the blue man had been absorbed in the north and eventually succumbed to the white cavalry raiders who penetrated the south, the advancing tribes of the mixed white race met with stubborn and protracted resistance from the Cro-Magnons, but superior intelligence and ever-augmenting biologic reserves enabled them to wipe the older race out of existence.” <a id="s1681_364"></a>[UB 80:5.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p5_1)

5. The decisive struggles between the blue man and the white man took place in the valley of the Somme.

	> “The decisive struggles between the white man and the blue man were fought out in the valley of the Somme. Here, the flower of the blue race bitterly contested the southward-moving Andites, and for over five hundred years these Cro-Magnoids successfully defended their territories before succumbing to the superior military strategy of the white invaders. Thor, the victorious commander of the armies of the north in the final battle of the Somme, became the hero of the northern white tribes and later on was revered as a god by some of them.” <a id="s1685_548"></a>[UB 80:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p5_4)

6. Commerce, intermarriage, and extermination of inferiors completed conquest of the blue man by the white races.

	> “The strongholds of the blue man which persisted longest were in southern France, but the last great military resistance was overcome along the Somme. The later conquest progressed by commercial penetration, population pressure along the rivers, and by continued intermarriage with the superiors, coupled with the ruthless extermination of the inferiors.
	> 
	> “When the tribal council of the Andite elders had adjudged an inferior captive to be unfit, he was, by elaborate ceremony, committed to the shaman priests, who escorted him to the river and administered the rites of initiation to the ‘happy hunting grounds’ —lethal submergence. In this way the white invaders of Europe exterminated all peoples encountered who were not quickly absorbed into their own ranks, and thus did the blue man come to an end-and quickly.” <a id="s1691_467"></a>[UB 80:5.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p5_5)

7. The legacy of the Cro-Magnoid blue man.

	> “The Cro-Magnoid blue man constituted the biologic foundation for the modern European races, but they have survived only as absorbed by the later and virile conquerors of their homelands. The blue strain contributed many sturdy traits and much physical vigor to the white races of Europe, but the humor and imagination of the blended European peoples were derived from the Andites. This Andite-blue union, resulting in the northern white races, produced an immediate lapse of Andite civilization, a retardation of a transient nature. Eventually, the latent superiority of these northern barbarians manifested itself and culminated in presentday European civilization.” <a id="s1695_672"></a>[UB 80:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p5_7)

#### D. The Andites of the Mediterranean Isles.

1. A superior group of Andites settled in Crete, while descendants of Adamson migrated from Mesopotamia into Greece.

	> “About 12,000 B.C. a brilliant tribe of Andites migrated to Crete. This was the only island settled so early by such a superior group, and it was almost two thousand years before the descendants of these mariners spread to the neighboring isles. This group were the narrow-headed, smaller-statured Andites who had intermarried with the Vanite division of the northern Nodites. They were all under six feet in height and had been literally driven off the mainland by their larger and inferior fellows. These emigrants to Crete were highly skilled in textiles, metals, pottery, plumbing, and the use of stone for building material. They engaged in writing and carried on as herders and agriculturists.
	> 
	> “Almost two thousand years after the settlement of Crete a group of the tall descendants of Adamson made their way over the northern islands to Greece, coming almost directly from their highland home north of Mesopotamia. These progenitors of the Greeks were led westward by Sato, a direct descendant of Adamson and Ratta.
	> 
	> “The group which finally settled in Greece consisted of three hundred and seventy-five of the selected and superior people comprising the end of the second civilization of the Adamsonites. These later sons of Adamson carried the then most valuable strains of the emerging white races. They were of a high intellectual order and physically regarded, the most beautiful of men since the days of the first Eden.
	> 
	> “Presently Greece and the Aegean Islands region succeeded Mesopotamia and Egypt as the Occidental center of trade, art, and culture. But as it was in Egypt, so again practically all of the art and science of the Aegean world was derived from Mesopotamia except for the culture of the Adamsonite forerunners of the Greeks. All the art and genius of these latter people is a direct legacy of the posterity of Adamson, the first son of Adam and Eve, and his extraordinary second wife, a daughter descended in an unbroken line from the pure Nodite staff of Prince Caligastia. No wonder the Greeks had mythological traditions that they were directly descended from gods and superhuman beings.” <a id="s1707_692"></a>[UB 80:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p7_2)

2. Origin of the mother cult.

	> “The Aegean region passed through five distinct cultural stages, each less spiritual than the preceding, and erelong the last glorious era of art perished beneath the weight of the rapidly multiplying mediocre descendants of the Danubian slaves who had been imported by the later generations of Greeks.
	> 
	> “It was during this age in Crete that the _mother cult_ of the descendants of Cain attained its greatest vogue. This cult glorified Eve in the worship of the ‘great mother.’ Images of Eve were everywhere. Thousands of public shrines were erected throughout Crete and Asia Minor. And this mother cult persisted on down to the times of Christ, becoming later incorporated in the early Christian religion under the guise of the glorification and worship of Mary the earth mother of Jesus.” <a id="s1713_490"></a>[UB 80:7.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p7_6)

3. In spite of deterioration due to influxes of inferior peoples, civilization in Cyprus and in northern Africa was improved by Andite movement migrations from Mesopotamia.

	> “By 5000 B.C. the three purest strains of Adam’s descendants were in Sumeria, northern Europe, and Greece. The whole of Mesopotamia was being slowly deteriorated by the stream of mixed and darker races which filtered in from Arabia. And the coming of these inferior peoples contributed further to the scattering abroad of the biologic and cultural residue of the Andites. From all over the fertile crescent the more adventurous peoples poured westward to the islands. These migrants cultivated both grain and vegetables, and they brought domesticated animals with them.
	> 
	> “About 5000 B.C. a mighty host of progressive Mesopotamians moved out of the Euphrates valley and settled upon the island of Cyprus; this civilization was wiped out about two thousand years subsequently by the barbarian hordes from the north.
	> 
	> “Another great colony settled on the Mediterranean near the later site of Carthage. And from north Africa large numbers of Andites entered Spain and later mingled in Switzerland with their brethren who had earlier come to Italy from the Aegean Islands.” <a id="s1721_257"></a>[UB 80:7.9-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p7_9)

4. The Greeks were great traders and colonizers as well as teachers and artists.

	> “The Greeks were not only great teachers and artists, they were also the world’s greatest traders and colonizers. Before succumbing to the flood of inferiority which eventually engulfed their art and commerce, they succeeded in planting so many outposts of culture to the west that a great many of the advances in early Greek civilization persisted in the later peoples of southern Europe, and many of the mixed descendants of these Adamsonites became incorporated in the tribes of the adjacent mainlands.” <a id="s1725_510"></a>[UB 80:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p7_13)

#### E. The Danubian Andonites.

The northern and southern Andites were separated by Andonites who were dispersed throughout central and southeastern Europe. The Hittites and descendants of Abraham carried some of this strain.

> “The Andite peoples of the Euphrates valley migrated north to Europe to mingle with the blue men and west into the Mediterranean regions to mix with the remnants of the commingled Saharans and the southern blue men. And these two branches of the white race were, and now are, widely separated by the broad-headed mountain survivors of the earlier Andonite tribes which had long inhabited these central regions.
> 
> “These descendants of Andon were dispersed through most of the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. They were often reinforced by arrivals from Asia Minor, which region they occupied in considerable strength. The ancient Hittites stemmed directly from the Andonite stock; their pale skins and broad heads were typical of that race. This strain was carried in Abraham’s ancestry and contributed much to the characteristic facial appearance of his later Jewish descendants who, while having a culture and religion derived from the Andites, spoke a very different language. Their tongue was distinctly Andonite.
> 
> “The tribes that dwelt in houses erected on piles or log piers over the lakes of Italy, Switzerland, and southern Europe were the expanding fringes of the African, Aegean, and, more especially, the Danubian migrations.
> 
> “The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the Danube valley. They made pottery and tilled the land, preferring to live in the valleys. The most northerly settlement of the Danubians was at Liege in Belgium. These tribes deteriorated rapidly as they moved away from the center and source of their culture. The best pottery is the product of the earlier settlements.
> 
> “The Danubians became mother worshipers as the result of the work of the missionaries from Crete. These tribes later amalgamated with groups of Andonite sailore who came by boats from the coast of Asia Minor, and who were also mother worshipers. Much of central Europe was thus early settled by these mixed types of the broad-headed white races which practiced mother worship and the religious rite of cremating the dead, for it was the custom of the mother cultists to burn their dead in stone huts.” <a id="s1739_504"></a>[UB 80:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_1)

#### F. The three white races.

1. The origin, nature, and distribution of the three white races.

	> “The racial blends in Europe toward the close of the Andite migrations became generalized into the three white races as follows:
	> “1. _The northern white race_. This so-called Nordic race consisted primarily of the blue man plus the Andite but also contained a considerable amount of Andonite blood, together with smaller amounts of the red and yellow Sangik. The northern white race thus encompassed these four most desirable human stocks. But the largest inheritance was from the blue man. The typical early Nordic was long-headed, tall, and blond. But long ago this race became thoroughly mixed with all of the branches of the white peoples.
	> “The primitive culture of Europe, which was encountered by the invading Nordics, was that of the retrograding Danubians blended with the blue man. The Nordic-Danish and the Danubian-Andonite cultures met and mingled on the Rhine as is witnessed by the existence of two racial groups in Germany today.
	> “The Nordics continued the trade in amber from the Baltic coast, building up a great commerce with the broadheads of the Danube valley via the Brenner Pass. This extended contact with the Danubians led these northerners into mother worship, and for several thousands of years cremation of the dead was almost universal throughout Scandinavia. This explains why remains of the earlier white races, although buried all over Europe, are not to be found-only their ashes in stone and clay urns. These white men also built dwellings; they never lived in caves. And again this explains why there are so few evidences of the white man’s early culture, although the preceding Cro-Magnon type is well preserved where it has been securely sealed up in caves and grottoes. As it were, one day in northern Europe there is a primitive culture of the retrogressing Danubians and the blue man and the next that of a suddenly appearing and vastly superior white man.
	> “2. _The central white race_. While this group includes strains of blue, yellow, and Andite, it is predominantly Andonite. These people are broad-headed, swarthy, and stocky. They are driven like a wedge between the Nordic and Mediterranean races, with the broad base resting in Asia and the apex penetrating eastern France.
	> “For almost twenty thousand years the Andonites had been pushed farther and farther to the north of central Asia by the Andites. By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity was driving these Andonites back into Turkestan. This Andonite push southward continued for over a thousand years and, splitting around the Caspian and Black seas, penetrated Europe by way of both the Balkans and the Ukraine. This invasion included the remaining groups of Adamson’s descendants and, during the latter half of the invasion period, carried with it considerable numbers of the Iranian Andites as well as many of the descendants of the Sethite priests.
	> “By 2500 B.C. the westward thrust of the Andonites reached Europe. And this overrunning of all Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and the Danube basin by the barbarians of the hills of Turkestan constituted the most serious and lasting of all cultural setbacks up to that time. These invaders definitely Andonized the character of the central European races, which have ever since remained characteristically Alpine.
	> “3. _The southern white race_. This brunet Mediterranean race consisted of a blend of the Andite and the blue man, with a smaller Andonite strain than in the north. This group also absorbed a considerable amount of secondary Sangik blood through the Saharans. In later times this southern division of the white race was infused by strong Andite elements from the eastern Mediterranean.
	> “The Mediterranean coastlands did not, however, become permeated by the Andites until the times of the great nomadic invasions of 2500 B.C. Land traffic and trade were nearly suspended during these centuries when the nomads invaded the eastern Mediterranean districts. This interference with land travel brought about the great expansion of sea traffic and trade; Mediterranean sea-borne commerce was in full swing about forty-five hundred years ago. And this development of marine traffic resulted in the sudden expansion of the descendants of the Andites throughout the entire coastal territory of the Mediterranean basin.
	> “These racial mixtures laid the foundations for the southern European race, the most highly mixed of all. And since these days this race has undergone still further admixture, notably with the blue-yellow-Andite peoples of Arabia. This Mediterranean race is, in fact, so freely admixed with the surrounding peoples as to be virtually indiscernible as a separate type, but in general its members are short, long-headed, and brunet.” <a id="s1754_435"></a>[UB 80:9.2-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_2)

2. Because of subsequent blending it is a fallacy to classify the white people as Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean.

	> “But it is a fallacy to presume to classify the white peoples as Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. There has been altogether too much blending to permit such a grouping. At one time there was a fairly well-defined division of the white race into such classes, but widespread intermingling has since occurred, and it is no longer possible to identify these distinctions with any clarity. Even in 3000 B.C. the ancient social groups were no more of one race than are the present inhabitants of North America.” <a id="s1758_512"></a>[UB 80:9.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_15)

### VI. **The Mixed Races**

#### A. Classification of present-day races.

1. The human races of today are a result of the blending of the five basic human stocks.

	> “As contact is made with the dawn of historic times, all of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands is overspread with the composite races of mankind. And these races of today have resulted from a blending and reblending of the five basic human stocks of Urantia.” <a id="s1766_278"></a>[UB 81:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p4_1)

2. Physical characteristics of the basic human races.

	> “Each of the Urantia races was identified by certain distinguishing physical characteristics. The Adamites and Nodites were long headed; the Andonites were broad-headed. The Sangik races were medium-headed, with the yellow and blue men tending to broadheadedness. The blue races, when mixed with the Andonite stock, were decidedly broad-headed. The secondary Sangiks were mediumto long-headed.” <a id="s1770_398"></a>[UB 81:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p4_2)

3. The five basic human races.

	> “Although these skull dimensions are serviceable in deciphering racial origins, the skeleton as a whole is far more dependable. In the early development of the Urantia races there were originally five distinct types of skeletal structure:
	> “1. Andonic, Urantia aborigines.
	> “2. Primary Sangik, red, yellow, and blue.
	> “3. Secondary Sangik, orange, green, and indigo.
	> “4. Nodites, descendants of the Dalamatians.
	> “5. Adamites, the violet race.” <a id="s1779_35"></a>[UB 81:4.3-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p4_3)

4. The Lapps and Eskimos are nearest to the original Andonic stock.

	> “As these five great racial groups extensively intermingled, continual mixture tended to obscure the Andonite type by Sangik hereditary dominance. The Lapps and the Eskimos are blends of Andonite and Sangik-blue races. Their skeletal structures come the nearest to preserving the aboriginal Andonic type. But the Adamites and the Nodites have become so admixed with the other races that they can be detected only as a generalized Caucasoid order.” <a id="s1783_451"></a>[UB 81:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p4_9)

5. Study of skeletal structure discloses three present-day types of mankind:
	1. Caucasoid.
	2. Mongoloid.
	3. Negroid.

	> “In general, therefore, as the human remains of the last twenty thousand years are unearthed, it will be impossible clearly to distinguish the five original types. Study of such skeletal structures will disclose that mankind is now divided into approximately three classes:
	> “1. _The Caucasoid_—the Andite blend of the Nodite and Adamic stocks, further modified by primary and (some) secondary Sangik admixture and by considerable Andonic crossing. The Occidental white races, together with some Indian and Turanian peoples, are included in this group. The unifying factor in this division is the greater or lesser proportion of Andite inheritance.
	> “2. _The Mongoloid_—the primary Sangik type, including the original red, yellow, and blue races. The Chinese and Amerinds belong to this group. In Europe the Mongoloid type has been modified by secondary Sangik and Andonic mixture; still more by Andite infusion.The Malayan and other Indonesian peoples are included in this classification, though they contain a high percentage of secondary Sangik blood.
	> “3. _The Negroid_—the secondary Sangik type, which originally included the orange, green, and Indigo races. This is the type best illustrated by the Negro, and it will be found through Africa, India, and Indonesia wherever the secondary Sangik races located.” <a id="s1793_263"></a>[UB 81:4.10-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p4_10)

6. There are no pure races in the world today.

	> “There are no pure races in the world today. The early and original evolutionary peoples of color have only two representative races persisting in the world, the yellow man and the black man; and even these two races are much admixed with the extinct colored peoples. While the so-called white race is predominantly descended from the ancient blue man, it is admixed more or less with all other races much as is the red man of the Americas.” <a id="s1797_445"></a>[UB 82:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p6_1)

7. The three primary and the three secondary human races.

	> “Of the six colored Sangik races, three were primary and three were secondary. Though the primary races—blue, red, and yellow—were in many respects superior to the three secondary peoples, it should be remembered that these secondary races had many desirable traits which would have considerably enhanced the primary peoples if their better strains could have been absorbed.” <a id="s1801_379"></a>[UB 82:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p6_2)

#### B. Factors that influenced the development of civilization.

1. The effects of climatic and geologic changes on early migrations.

	> “It was the great climatic and geologic changes in northern Africa and western Asia that terminated the early migrations of the Adamites, barring them from Europe by the expanded Mediterranean and diverting the stream of migration north and east into Turkestan. By the time of the completion of these land elevations and associated climatic changes, about 15,000 B.C., civilization had settled down to a world-wide stalemate except for the cultural ferments and biologic reserves of the Andites still confined by mountains to the east in Asia and by the expanding forests in Europe to the west.” <a id="s1807_599"></a>[UB 81:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_2)

2. Climatic changes forced man to abandon hunting for herding and farming. Evolution may be slow, but it is terribly effective.

	> “Climatic evolution is now about to accomplish what all other efforts had failed to do, that is, to compel Eurasian man to abandon hunting for the more advanced callings of herding and farming. Evolution may be slow, but it is terribly effective.” <a id="s1811_251"></a>[UB 81:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_3)

3. The trader and explorer did more to advance historic civilization than all other influences combined.

	> “The traveling trader and the roving explorer did more to advance historic civilization than all other influences combined. Military conquests, colonization, and missionary enterprises fostered by the later religions were also factors in the spread of culture; but these were all secondary to the trading relations, which were ever accelerated by the rapidly developing arts and sciences of industry.” <a id="s1815_405"></a>[UB 81:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p3_7)

## SECTION 7. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIZATION

> “Civilization is a racial acquirement; it is not biologically inherent; hence must all children be reared in an environment of culture, while each succeeding generation of youth must receive anew its education. The superior qualities of civilization—scientific, philosophic, and religious—are not transmitted from one generation to another by direct inheritance. These cultural achievements are preserved only by the enlightened conservation of social inheritance.” <a id="s1819_468"></a>[UB 68:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p0_2)

### I. **Steps in the Evolution of Civilization**

#### A. Socialization.

1. Association became the price of survival.

	> “Association early became the price of survival. The lone man was helpless unless he bore a tribal mark which testified that he belonged to a group which would certainly avenge any assault made upon him. Even in the days of Cain it was fatal to go abroad alone without some mark of group association. Civilization has become man’s insurance against violent death, while the premiums are paid by submission to society’s numerous law demands.
	> 
	> “Primitive society was thus founded on the reciprocity of necessity and on the enhanced safety of association. And human society has evolved in agelong cycles as a result of this isolation fear and by means of reluctant co-operation.” <a id="s1829_238"></a>[UB 68:1.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p1_2)

2. Primitive man early learned that organization and co-operation were essential to successful resolution of difficulties.

	> “Primitive human beings early learned that groups are vastly greater and stronger than the mere sum of their individual units. One hundred men united and working in unison can move a great stone; a score of well-trained guardians of the peace can restrain an angry mob. And so society was born, not of mere association of numbers, but rather as a result of the _organization_ of intelligent co-operators. But co-operation is not a natural trait of man; he learns to co-operate first through fear and then later because he discovers it is most beneficial in meeting the difficulties of time and guarding against the supposed perils of eternity.
	> 
	> “The peoples who thus early organized themselves into a primitive society became more successful in their attacks on nature as well as in defense against their fellows; they possessed greater survival possibilities; hence has civilization steadily progressed on Urantia, notwithstanding its many setbacks. And it is only because of the enhancement of survival value in association that man’s many blunders have thus far failed to stop or destroy human civilization.” <a id="s1835_470"></a>[UB 68:1.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p1_4)

3. Four factors which contributed to the association of human beings were food hunger, sex love, vanity, and fear.

	> “The herd instinct in natural man is hardly sufficient to account for the development of such a social organization as now exists on Urantia. Though this innate gregarious propensity lies at the bottom of human society, much of man’s sociability is an acquirement. Two great influences which contributed to the early association of human beings were food hunger and sex love; these instinctive urges man shares with the animal world. Two other emotions which drove human beings together and _held_ them together were vanity and fear, more particularly ghost fear.
	> 
	> “History is but the record of man’s agelong food struggle. _Primitive man only thought when he was hungry_; food saving was his first self-denial, self-discipline. With the growth of society, food hunger ceased to be the only incentive for mutual association. Numerous other sorts of hunger, the realization of various needs, all led to the closer association of mankind. But today society is top-heavy with the overgrowth of supposed human needs. Occidental civilization of the twentieth century groans wearily under the tremendous overload of luxury and the inordinate multiplication of human desires and longings. Modern society is enduring the strain of one of its most dangerous phases of far-flung interassociation and highly complicated interdependence.
	> 
	> “Hunger, vanity, and ghost fear were continuous in their social pressure, but sex gratification was transient and spasmodic. The sex urge alone did not impel primitive men and women to assume the heavy burdens of home maintenance. The early home was founded upon the sex restlessness of the male when deprived of frequent gratification and upon that devoted mother love of the human female, which in measure she shares with the females of all the higher animals. The presence of a helpless baby determined the early differentiation of male and female activities; the woman had to maintain a settled residence where she could cultivate the soil. And from earliest times, where woman was has always been regarded as the home.”
	> 
	> “Woman thus early became indispensable to the evolving social scheme, not so much because of the fleeting sex passion as in consequence of _food requirement_; she was an essential partner in self-maintenance. She was a food provider, a beast of burden, and a companion who would stand great abuse without violent resentment, and in addition to all of these desirable traits, she was an everpresent means of sex gratification.” <a id="s1845_430"></a>[UB 68:2.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_4)

	> “If vanity be enlarged to cover pride, ambition, and honor, then we may discern not only how these propensities contribute to the formation of human associations, but how they also hold men together, since such emotions are futile without an audience to parade before. Soon vanity associated with itself other emotions and impulses which required a social arena wherein they might exhibit and gratify themselves. This group of emotions gave origin to the early beginnings of all art, ceremonial, and all forms of sportive games and contests.” <a id="s1847_546"></a>[UB 68:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p2_10)

	> “Probably the greatest single factor in the evolution of human society was the ghost dream. Although most dreams greatly perturbed the primitive mind, the ghost dream actually terrorized early men, driving these superstitious dreamers into each other’s arms in willing and earnest association for mutual protection against the vague and unseen imaginary dangers of the spirit world. The ghost dream was one of the earliest appearing differences between the animal and human types of mind. Animals do not visualize survival after death.” <a id="s1849_540"></a>[UB 68:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p3_2)

4. Help from superhuman sources is necessary to keep the associations built up through hunger, love, vanity, and fear.

	> “Hunger and love drove men together; vanity and ghost fear held them together. But these emotions alone, without the influence of peace-promoting revelations, are unable to endure the strain of the suspicions and irritations of human interassociations. Without help from superhuman sources the strain of society breaks down upon reaching certain limits, and these very influences of social mobilization—hunger, love, vanity, and fear—conspire to plunge mankind into war and bloodshed.
	> 
	> “The peace tendency of the human race is not a natural endowment; it is derived from the teachings of revealed religion, from the accumulated experience of the progressive races, but more especially from the teachings of Jesus, the Prince of Peace.” <a id="s1855_253"></a>[UB 68:3.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p3_4)

5. Though early man was a slave to custom or usage, custom has been the thread of continuity which held civilization together.

	> “Prior to the liberating and liberalizing instruction of the Dalamatia teachers, ancient man was held a helpless victim of the ritual of the mores; the primitive savage was hedged about by an endless ceremonial. Everything he did from the time of awakening in the morning to the moment he fell asleep in his cave at night had to be done just so—in accordance with the folkways of the tribe. He was a slave to the tyranny of usage; his life contained nothing free, spontaneous, or original. There was no natural progress toward a higher mental, moral, or social existence.
	> 
	> “Early man was mightily gripped by custom; the savage was a veritable slave to usage; but there have arisen ever and anon those variations from type who have dared to inaugurate new ways of thinking and improved methods of living. Nevertheless, the inertia of primitive man constitutes the biologic safety brake against precipitation too suddenly into the ruinous maladjustment of a too rapidly advancing civilization.
	> 
	> “But these customs are not an unmitigated evil; their evolution should continue. It is nearly fatal to the continuance of civilization to undertake their wholesale modification by radical revolution. Custom has been the thread of continuity which has held civilization together. The path of human history is strewn with the remnants of discarded customs and obsolete social practices; but no civilization has endured which abandoned its mores except for the adoption of better and more fit customs.
	> 
	> “The survival of a society depends chiefly on the progressive evolution of its mores. The process of custom evolution grows out of the desire for experimentation; new ideas are put forward-competition ensues. A progressing civilization embraces the progressive idea and endures; time and circumstance finally select the fitter group for survival. But this does not mean that each separate and isolated change in the composition of human society has been for the better. No! indeed no! for there have been many, many retrogressions in the long forward struggle of Urantia civilization.” <a id="s1865_589"></a>[UB 68:4.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p4_4)

6. In the Eastern Hemisphere there were four great steps in the forward march of civilization.

	> “The earliest human cultures arose along the rivers of the Eastern Hemisphere, and there were four great steps in the forward march of civilization. They were:
	> 
	> “1. _The collection stage_. Food coercion, hunger, led to the first form of industrial organization, the primitive food-gathering lines. Sometimes such a line of hunger march would be ten miles long as it passed over the land gleaning food. This was the primitive nomadic stage of culture and is the mode of life now followed by the African Bushmen.
	> 
	> “2. _The hunting stage_. The invention of weapon tools enabled man to become a hunter and thus to gain considerable freedom from food slavery. A thoughtful Andonite who had severely bruised his fist in a serious combat rediscovered the idea of using a long stick for his arm and a piece of hard flint, bound on the end with sinews, for his fist. Many tribes made independent discoveries of this sort, and these various forms of hammers represented one of the great forward steps in human civilization. Today some Australian natives have progressed little beyond this stage.
	> 
	> “The blue men became expert hunters and trappers; by fencing the rivers they caught fish in great numbers, drying the surplus for winter use. Many forms of ingenious snares and traps were employed in catching game, but the more primitive races did not hunt the larger animals.
	> 
	> “3. _The pastoral stage_. This phase of civilization was made possible by the domestication of animals. The Arabs and the natives of Africa are among the more recent pastoral peoples.
	> 
	> “Pastoral living afforded further relief from food slavery; man learned to live on the interest of his capital, the increase in his flocks; and this provided more leisure for culture and progress.
	> 
	> “Prepastoral society was one of sex co-operation, but the spread of animal husbandry reduced women to the depths of social slavery. In earlier times it was man’s duty to secure the animal food, woman’s business to provide the vegetable edibles. Therefore, when man entered the pastoral era of his existence, woman’s dignity fell greatly. She must still toil to produce the vegetable necessities of life, whereas the man need only go to his herds to provide an abundance of animal food. Man thus became relatively independent of woman; throughout the entire pastoral age woman’s status steadily declined. By the close of this era she had become scarcely more than a human animal, consigned to work and to bear human offspring, much as the animals of the herd were expected to labor and bring forth young. The men of the pastoral ages had great love for their cattle; all the more pity they could not have developed a deeper affection for their wives.
	> 
	> “4. _The agricultural stage_. This era was brought about by the domestication of plants, and it represents the highest type of material civilization. Both Caligastia and Adam endeavored to teach horticulture and agriculture. Adam and Eve were gardeners, not shepherds, and gardening was an advanced culture in those days. The growing of plants exerts an ennobling influence on all races of mankind.
	> 
	> “Agriculture more than quadrupled the land-man ratio of the world. It may be combined with the pastoral pursuits of the former cultural stage. When the three stages overlap, men hunt and women till the soil.
	> 
	> “There has always been friction between the herders and the tillers of the soil. The hunter and herder were militant, warlike; the agriculturist is a more peace-loving type. Association with animals suggests struggle and force; association with plants instills patience, quiet, and peace. Agriculture and industrialism are the activities of peace. But the weakness of both, as world social activities, is that they lack excitement and adventure.
	> 
	> “Human society has evolved from the hunting stage through that of the herders to the territorial stage of agriculture. And each stage of this progressive civilization was accompanied by less and less of nomadism; more and more man began to live at home.
	> 
	> “And now is industry supplementing agriculture, with consequently increased urbanization and multiplication of nonagricultural groups of citizenship classes. But an industrial era cannot hope to survive if its leaders fail to recognize that even the highest social developments must ever rest upon a sound agricultural basis.” <a id="s1891_330"></a>[UB 68:5.2-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_2)

7. The land-man ratio determined the value of human life.

	> “Human society is controlled by a law which decrees that the population must vary directly in accordance with the land arts and inversely with a given standard of living. Throughout these early ages, even more than at present, the law of supply and demand as concerned men and land determined the estimated value of both. During the times of plentiful land—unoccupied territory—the need for men was great, and therefore the value of human life was much enhanced; hence the loss of life was more horrifying. During periods of land scarcity and associated overpopulation, human life became comparatively cheapened so that war, famine, and pestilence were regarded with less concern.
	> 
	> “When the land yield is reduced or the population is increased, the inevitable struggle is renewed; the very worst traits of human nature are brought to the surface. The improvement of the land yield, the extension of the mechanical arts, and the reduction of population all tend to foster the development of the better side of human nature.” <a id="s1897_346"></a>[UB 68:6.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_3)

8. Overpopulation, though seldom a problem in the past, may become a test of the wisdom of Urantia rulers.

	> “From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. Will Urantia rulers have the insight and courage to foster the multiplication of the average or stabilized human being instead of the extremes of the supernormal and the enormously increasing groups of the subnormal? The normal man should be fostered; he is the backbone of civilization and the source of the mutant geniuses of the race. The subnormal man should be kept under society’s control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks requiring intelligence above the animal level but making such low-grade demands as to prove veritable slavery and bondage for the higher types of mankind.” <a id="s1901_953"></a>[UB 68:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_11)

#### B. Social institutions.

1. Man should control his institutions—not be controlled by them.

	> “All human institutions minister to some social need, past or present, notwithstanding that their overdevelopment unfailingly detracts from the worthwhileness of the individual in that personality is overshadowed and initiative is diminished. Man should control his institutions rather than permit himself to be dominated by these creations of advancing civilization.” <a id="s1907_372"></a>[UB 69:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p1_1)

2. Primitive industry grew up as insurance against famine.

	> “Primitive industry slowly grew up as an insurance against the terrors of famine. Early in his existence man began to draw lessons from some of the animals that, during a harvest of plenty, store up food against the days of scarcity.” <a id="s1911_238"></a>[UB 69:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_1)

3. Poverty is man’s natural estate. Wealth is derived from labor, knowledge, and organization.

	> “Before the dawn of early frugality and primitive industry the lot of the average tribe was one of destitution and real suffering. Early man had to compete with the whole animal world for his food. Competition-gravity ever pulls man down toward the beast level; poverty is his natural and tyrannical estate. Wealth is not a natural gift; it results from labor, knowledge, and organization.” <a id="s1915_394"></a>[UB 69:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_2)

4. The relation of capital to modern civilization.

	> “Though capital has tended to liberate man, it has greatly complicated his social and industrial organization. The abuse of capital by unfair capitalists does not destroy the fact that it is the basis of modern industrial society. Through capital and invention the present generation enjoys a higher degree of freedom than any that ever preceded it on earth. This is placed on record as a fact and not in justification of the many misuses of capital by thoughtless and selfish custodians.” <a id="s1919_493"></a>[UB 69:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p5_15)

5. The evolution of human government.

	> “Every human institution had a beginning, and civil government is a product of progressive evolution just as much as are marriage, industry, and religion. From the early clans and primitive tribes there gradually developed the successive orders of human government which have come and gone right on down to those forms of social and civil regulation that characterize the second third of the twentieth century.” <a id="s1923_415"></a>[UB 70:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p5_1)

6. Only very primitive and very advanced civilizations are free from those human inequalities which create social classes.

	> “The mental and physical inequality of human beings insures that social classes will appear. The only worlds without social strata are the most primitive and the most advanced. A dawning civilization has not yet begun the differentiation of social levels, while a world settled in light and life has largely effaced these divisions of mankind, which are so characteristic of all intermediate evolutionary stages.” <a id="s1927_417"></a>[UB 70:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p8_1)

7. Profit-motivated economy is doomed unless it is augmented by service motives. Exclusive self-service motives are incompatible with the teachings of Jesus.

	> “Present-day profit-motivated economics is doomed unless profit motives can be augmented by service motives. Ruthless competition based on narrow-minded self-interest is ultimately destructive of even those things which it seeks to maintain. Exclusive and selfserving profit motivation is incompatible with Christian ideals-much more incompatible with the teachings of Jesus.” <a id="s1931_380"></a>[UB 71:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_1)

8. In economics, profit motivation is to service motivation what fear is to love in religion.

	> “In economics, profit motivation is to service motivation what fear is to love in religion. But the profit motive must not be suddenly destroyed or removed; it keeps many otherwise slothful mortals hard at work. It is not necessary, however, that this social energy arouser be forever selfish in its objectives.” <a id="s1935_316"></a>[UB 71:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_2)

9. Profit-making can only be transcended by wisdom, brotherhood, and spiritual attainment.

	> “The profit motive of economic activities is altogether base and wholly unworthy of an advanced order of society; nevertheless, it is an indispensable factor throughout the earlier phases of civilization. Profit motivation must not be taken away from men until they have firmly possessed themselves of superior types of nonprofit motives for economic striving and social serving—the transcendent urges of superlative wisdom, intriguing brotherhood, and excellency of spiritual attainment.” <a id="s1939_493"></a>[UB 71:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p6_3)

#### C. Fire and animals.

1. Fire is a civilizing influence.

	> “Fire was a great civilizer, providing man with his first means of being altruistic without loss by enabling him to give live coals to a neighbor without depriving himself. The household fire, which was attended by the mother or eldest daughter, was the first educator, requiring watchfulness and dependability. The early home was not a building but the family gathered about the fire, the family hearth. When a son founded a new home, he carried a firebrand from the family hearth.” <a id="s1945_487"></a>[UB 69:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p6_3)

2. Fire, along with water and food, contributed to early human foresight.

	> “The first human foresight was directed toward the preservation of fire, water, and food. But primitive man was a natural-born gambler; he always wanted to get something for nothing, and all too often during these early times the success which accrued from patient practice was attributed to charms. Magic was slow to give way before foresight, self-denial, and industry.” <a id="s1949_376"></a>[UB 69:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_7)

3. The part played by animals in advancing civilization.

	> “To start with, the entire animal world was man’s enemy; human beings had to learn to protect themselves from the beasts. First, man ate the animals but later learned to domesticate and make them serve him.
	> 
	> “The domestication of animals came about accidentally. The savage would hunt herds much as the American Indians hunted the bison. By surrounding the herd they could keep control of the animals, thus being able to kill them as they were required for food. Later, corrals were constructed, and entire herds would be captured.” <a id="s1955_328"></a>[UB 69:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p7_1)

#### D. War and slavery.

1. War is natural to evolving man; peace is the yardstick measuring civilization.

	> “War is the natural state and heritage of evolving man; peace is the social yardstick measuring civilization’s advancement. Before the partial socialization of the advancing races man was exceedingly individualistic, extremely suspicious, and unbelievably quarrelsome. Violence is the law of nature, hostility the automatic reaction of the children of nature, while war is but these same activities carried on collectively. And wherever and whenever the fabric of civilization becomes stressed by the complications of society’s advancement, there is always an immediate and ruinous reversion to these early methods of violent adjustment of the irritations of human interassociations.” <a id="s1961_688"></a>[UB 70:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_1)

2. The gains and losses of war. While curing some social evils, war sometimes kills the patient.

	> “In past ages a fierce war would institute social changes and facilitate the adoption of new ideas such as would not have occurred naturally in ten thousand years. The terrible price paid for these certain war advantages was that society was temporarily thrown back into savagery; civilized reason had to abdicate. War is strong medicine, very costly and most dangerous; while often curative of certain social disorders, it sometimes kills the patient, destroys the society.” <a id="s1965_479"></a>[UB 70:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_1)

3. The social gains of war.

	> “The constant necessity for national defense creates many new and advanced social adjustments. Society, today, enjoys the benefit of a long list of useful innovations which were at first wholly military and is even indebted to war for the dance, one of the early forms of which was a military drill.
	> “War has had a social value to past civilizations because it:
	> “1. Imposed discipline, enforced co-operation.
	> “2. Put a premium on fortitude and courage.
	> “3. Fostered and solidified nationalism.
	> “4. Destroyed weak and unfit peoples.
	> “5. Dissolved the illusion of primitive equality and selectively stratified society.” <a id="s1975_89"></a>[UB 70:2.2-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_2)

4. Ancient wars selected leaders. Today, science and industry must do this.

	> “But even in passing, war should be honored as the school of experience which compelled a race of arrogant individualists to submit themselves to highly concentrated authority—a chief executive. Old-fashioned war did select the innately great men for leadership, but modern war no longer does this. To discover leaders society must now turn to the conquests of peace: industry, science, and social achievement.” <a id="s1979_415"></a>[UB 70:2.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_21)

5. Enslavement of war captives was a forward and merciful advance in civilization.

	> “Enslavement was a forward step in the merciful treatment of war captives. The ambush of Ai, with the wholesale slaughter of men, women, and children, only the king being saved to gratify the conqueror’s vanity, is a faithful picture of the barbaric slaughter practiced by even supposedly civilized peoples. The raid upon Og, the king of Bashan, was equally brutal and effective. The Hebrews ‘utterly destroyed’ their enemies, taking all their property as spoils. They put all cities under tribute on pain of the ‘destruction of all males.’ But many of the contemporary tribes, those having less tribal egotism, had long since begun to practice the adoption of superior captives.” <a id="s1983_684"></a>[UB 69:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_3)

6. The contribution of slavery to advancing civilization.

	> “Slavery was an indispensable link in the chain of human civilization. It was the bridge over which society passed from chaos and indolence to order and civilized activities; it compelled backward and lazy peoples to work and thus provide wealth and leisure for the social advancement of their superiors.” <a id="s1987_309"></a>[UB 69:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p8_6)

#### E. Communism and private ownership.

1. The pros and cons of primitive communism.

	> “While primitive society was virtually communal, primitive man did not adhere to the modern doctrines of communism. The communism of these early times was not a mere theory or social doctrine; it was a simple and practical automatic adjustment. Communism prevented pauperism and want; begging and prostitution were almost unknown among these ancient tribes.
	> 
	> “Primitive communism did not especially level men down, nor did it exalt mediocrity, but it did put a premium on inactivity and idleness, and it did stifle industry and destroy ambition. Communism was indispensable scaffolding in the growth of primitive society, but it gave way to the evolution of a higher social order because it ran counter to four strong human proclivities.” <a id="s1995_383"></a>[UB 69:9.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_1)

2. Private ownership followed the failure of communism. And now, following slavery, comes the machine age.

	> “Private ownership brought increased liberty and enhanced stability; but private ownership of land was given social sanction only after communal control and direction had failed, and it was soon followed by a succession of slaves, serfs, and landless classes. But improved machinery is gradually setting men free from slavish toil.” <a id="s1999_336"></a>[UB 69:9.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_16)

3. The advantages of modern civilization have grown up around the private ownership of property.

	> “The right to property is not absolute; it is purely social. But all government, law, order, civil rights, social liberties, conventions, peace, and happiness, as they are enjoyed by modern peoples, have grown up around the private ownership of property.” <a id="s2003_259"></a>[UB 69:9.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_17)

4. Present social order is not divine, but if we change—we should be sure to change for the better.

	> “The present social order is not necessarily right—not divine or sacred—but mankind will do well to move slowly in making system known to your ancestors. Make certain that when you change the social order you change for the better. Do not be persuaded to experiment with the discarded formulas of your forefathers. Go forward, not backward! Let evolution proceed! Do not take a backward step.” <a id="s2007_397"></a>[UB 69:9.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_18)

#### F. Human rights—justice.

1. Nature confers no rights on man—only life.

	> “Nature confers no rights on man, only life and a world in which to live it. Nature does not even confer the right to live, as might be deduced by considering what would likely happen if an unarmed man met a hungry tiger face to face in the primitive forest. Society’s prime gift to man is security.” <a id="s2013_304"></a>[UB 70:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p9_1)

2. Natural justice is a myth. Justice, as conceived by man, is a matter of progressive evolution.

	> “Natural justice is a man-made theory; it is not a reality. In nature, justice is purely theoretic, wholly a fiction. Nature provides but one kind of justice—inevitable conformity of results to causes.
	> 
	> “Justice, as conceived by man, means getting one’s rights and has, therefore, been a matter of progressive evolution. The concept of justice may well be constitutive in a spirit-endowed mind, but it does not spring full-fledgedly into existence on the worlds of space.” <a id="s2019_273"></a>[UB 70:10.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p10_1)

3. Evolution of justice.

	> “Justice was thus first meted out by the family, then by the clan, and later on by the tribe. The administration of true justice dates from the taking of revenge from private and kin groups and lodging it in the hands of the social group, the state.” <a id="s2023_254"></a>[UB 70:10.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p10_13)

	> “But as time passed, it was learned that the severity of the punishment was not so valuable a deterrent to crime as was its certainty and swiftness.” <a id="s2025_153"></a>[UB 70:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p10_15)

4. Evolution of laws and courts.

	> “It is just as difficult to draw sharp distinctions between mores and laws as to indicate exactly when, at the dawning, night is succeeded by day. Mores are laws and police regulations in the making. When long established, the undefined mores tend to crystallize into precise laws, concrete regulations, and well-defined social conventions.
	> 
	> “Law is always at first negative and prohibitive; in advancing civilizations it becomes increasingly positive and directive. Early society operated negatively, granting the individual the right to live by imposing upon all others the command, ‘you shall not kill.’ Every grant of rights or liberty to the individual involves curtailment of the liberties of all others, and this is effected by the taboo, primitive law. The whole idea of the taboo is inherently negative, for primitive society was wholly negative in its organization, and the early administration of justice consisted in the enforcement of the taboos. But originally these laws applied only to fellow tribesmen, as is illustrated by the later-day Hebrews, who had a different code of ethics for dealing with the gentiles.” <a id="s2031_792"></a>[UB 70:11.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p11_1)

	> “Law is a codified record of long human experience, public opinion crystallized and legalized. The mores were the raw material of accumulated experience out of which later ruling minds formulated the written laws. The ancient judge had no laws. When he handed down a decision, he simply said, ‘It is the custom.’” <a id="s2033_317"></a>[UB 70:11.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p11_6)

	> “Property disputes were handled in many ways, such as:
	> “1. By destroying the disputed property.
	> “2. By force—the contestants fought it out.
	> “3. By arbitration—a third party decided.
	> “4. By appeal to the elders—later to the courts.” <a id="s2039_53"></a>[UB 70:11.8-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p11_8)

	> “The whole idea of primitive justice was not so much to be fair as to dispose of the contest and thus prevent public disorder and private violence. But primitive man did not so much resent what would now be regarded as an injustice; it was taken for granted that those who had power would use it selfishly. Nevertheless, the status of any civilization may be very accurately determined by the thoroughness and equity of its courts and by the integrity of its judges.” <a id="s2041_471"></a>[UB 70:11.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p11_14)

5. The state is the net gain of war and suffering. It was automatic in origin.

	> “The state is a useful evolution of civilization; it represents society’s net gain from the ravages and sufferings of war. Even statecraft is merely the accumulated technique for adjusting the competitive contest of force between the struggling tribes and nations.
	> 
	> “The modern state is the institution which survived in the long struggle for group power. Superior power eventually prevailed, and it produced a creature of fact—the state—together with the moral myth of the absolute obligation of the citizen to live and die for the state. But the state is not of divine genesis; it was not even produced by volitionally intelligent human action; it is purely an evolutionary institution and was wholly automatic in origin.” <a id="s2047_462"></a>[UB 71:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p0_1)

6. Social idealists should protect themselves against those who would exploit or destroy their civilization.

	> “The appearance of genuine brotherhood signifies that a social order has arrived in which all men delight in bearing one another’s burdens; they actually desire to practice the golden rule. But such an ideal society cannot be realized when either the weak or the wicked lie in wait to take unfair and unholy advantage of those who are chiefly actuated by devotion to the service of truth, beauty, and goodness. In such a situation only one course is practical: The ‘golden rulers’ may establish a progressive society in which they live according to their ideals while maintaining an adequate defense against their benighted fellows who might seek either to exploit their pacific predilections or to destroy their advancing civilization.” <a id="s2051_741"></a>[UB 71:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p4_16)

7. The test of idealism—having power to resist aggression, but refusing to use such power for self-aggrandizement.

	> “Idealism can never survive on an evolving planet if the idealists in each generation permit themselves to be exterminated by the baser orders of humanity. And here is the great test of idealism: Can an advanced society maintain that military preparedness which renders it secure from all attack by its war-loving neighbors without yielding to the temptation to employ this military strength in offensive operations against other peoples for purposes of selfish gain or national aggrandizement? National survival demands preparedness, and religious idealism alone can prevent the prostitution of preparedness into aggression. Only love, brotherhood, can prevent the strong from oppressing the weak.” <a id="s2055_703"></a>[UB 71:4.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p4_17)

#### G. Marriage.

> “Marriage—mating—grows out of bisexuality. Marriage is man’s reactional adjustment to such bisexuality, while the family life is the sum total resulting from all such evolutionary and adaptative adjustments. Marriage is enduring; it is not inherent in biologic evolution, but it is the basis of all social evolution and is therefore certain of continued existence in some form. Marriage has given mankind the home, and the home is the crowning glory of the whole long and arduous evolutionary struggle.” <a id="s2059_506"></a>[UB 82:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_1)

1. Marriage represents the effort of society to control the sex urge of self-perpetuation.

	> “As an institution, marriage, from its early beginnings down to modern times, pictures the social evolution of the biologic propensity for self-perpetuation. The perpetuation of the evolving human species is made certain by the presence of this racial mating impulse, an urge which is loosely called sex attraction. This great biologic urge becomes the impulse hub for all sorts of associated instincts, emotions, and usages—physical, intellectual, moral, and social.” <a id="s2063_472"></a>[UB 82:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p1_8)

2. With advancing civilization, the sex drive transcends the food urge and must be subjected to social control.

	> “With the savage, the food supply was the impelling motivation, but when civilization insures plentiful food, the sex urge many times becomes a dominant impulse and therefore ever stands in need of social regulation. In animals, instinctive periodicity checks the mating propensity, but since man is so largely a self-controlled being, sex desire is not altogether periodic; therefore does it become necessary for society to impose self-control upon the individual.” <a id="s2067_470"></a>[UB 82:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p1_9)

3. Nature insists on reproduction, but the problems of sex control must be solved by society.

	> “The story of the evolution of marriage is simply the history of sex control through the pressure of social, religious, and civil restrictions. Nature hardly recognizes individuals; it takes no cognizance of so-called morals; it is only and exclusively interested in the reproduction of the species. Nature compellingly insists on reproduction but indifferently leaves the consequential problems to be solved by society, thus creating an everpresent and major problem for evolutionary mankind. This social conflict consists in the unending war between basic instincts and evolving ethics.” <a id="s2071_593"></a>[UB 82:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p2_1)

4. Marriage is society’s response to the biologic urge to reproduction.

	> “Marriage is the institutional response of the social organism to the ever-present biologic tension of man’s unremitting urge to reproduction—self-propagation. Mating is universally natural, and as society evolved from the simple to the complex, there was a corresponding evolution of the mating mores, the genesis of the marital institution. Wherever social evolution has progressed to the stage at which mores are generated, marriage will be found as an evolving institution.” <a id="s2075_482"></a>[UB 82:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p3_1)

5. In primitive times marriage was the price of social standing. From age to age the purpose of marriage has been regarded differently.

	> “In primitive times marriage was the price of social standing; the possession of a wife was a badge of distinction. The savage looked upon his wedding day as marking his entrance upon responsibility and manhood. In one age, marriage has been looked upon as a social duty; in another, as a religious obligation; and in still another, as a political requirement to provide citizens for the state.” <a id="s2079_399"></a>[UB 82:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p3_4)

6. Primitive marriage was an investment; it involved an exchange of property.

	> “Primitive marriage was an investment, an economic speculation; it was more a matter of business than an affair of flirtation. The ancients married for the advantage and welfare of the group; wherefore their marriages were planned and arranged by the group, their parents and elders. And that the property mores were effective in stabilizing the marriage institution is borne out by the fact that marriage was more permanent among the early tribes than it is among many modern peoples.
	> 
	> “As civilization advanced and private property gained further recognition in the mores, stealing became the great crime. Adultery was recognized as a form of stealing, an infringement of the husband’s property rights; it is not therefore specifically mentioned in the earlier codes and mores. Woman started out as the property of her father, who transferred his title to her husband, and all legalized sex relations grew out of these pre-existent property rights. The Old Testament deals with women as a form of property; the Koran teaches their inferiority. Man had the right to lend his wife to a friend or guest, and this custom still obtains among certain peoples.” <a id="s2085_673"></a>[UB 82:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p4_3)

7. Though inbreeding sometimes resulted in the upbuilding of strong tribes, the frequent bad results led primitive man to formulate taboos against in-marriage.

	> “While the inbreeding of good stock sometimes resulted in the upbuilding of strong tribes, the spectacular cases of the bad results of the inbreeding of hereditary defectives more forcibly impressed the mind of man, with the result that the advancing mores increasingly formulated taboos against all marriages among near relatives.” <a id="s2089_336"></a>[UB 82:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p5_2)

	> “Many tribes finally forbade marriages within the clan; others limited mating to certain castes. The taboo against marriage with a woman of one’s own totem gave impetus to the custom of stealing women from neighboring tribes. Later on, marriages were regulated more in accordance with territorial residence than with kinship. There were many steps in the evolution of in-marriage into the modern practice of outmarriage. Even after the taboo rested upon in-marriages for the common people, chiefs and kings were permitted to marry those of close kin in order to keep the royal blood concentrated and pure. The mores have usually permitted sovereign rulers certain licenses in sex matters.” <a id="s2091_693"></a>[UB 82:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p5_7)

8. Marriage is society’s regulator of sex relations and inheritance.

	> “Marriage is society’s mechanism designed to regulate and control those many human relations which arise out of the physical fact of bisexuality. As such an institution, marriage functions in two directions:
	> “1. In the regulation of personal sex relations.
	> “2. In the regulation of descent, inheritance, succession, and social order, this being its older and original function.” <a id="s2097_125"></a>[UB 83:1.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p1_1)

9. The wedding ceremony resulted from the fact that marriage was a community affair. The luck element culminated in church weddings.

	> “The wedding ceremony grew out of the fact that marriage was originally a community affair, not just the culmination of a decision of two individuals. Mating was of group concern as well as a personal function.” <a id="s2101_215"></a>[UB 83:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p4_1)

	> “The luck element, that in spite of all premarital tests certain marriages turned out bad, led primitive man to seek insurance protection against marriage failure; led him to go in quest of priests and magic. And this movement culminated directly in modern church weddings. But for a long time marriage was generally recognized as consisting in the decisions of the contracting parents—later of the pair—while for the last five hundred years church and state have assumed jurisdiction and now presume to make pronouncements of marriage.” <a id="s2103_541"></a>[UB 83:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p4_9)

10. Marriage progressed from the promiscuity of the herd to group marriages and then to polygamy.

	> “The next step in mating evolution was the _group marriage._ This communal phase of marriage had to intervene in the unfolding of family life because the marriage mores were not yet strong enough to make pair associations permanent. The brother and sister marriages belonged to this group; five brothers of one family would marry five sisters of another. All over the world the looser forms of communal marriage gradually evolved into various types of group marriage. And these group associations were largely regulated by the totem mores. Family life slowly and surely developed because sex and marriage regulation favored the survival of the tribe itself by insuring the survival of larger numbers of children.
	> 
	> “Group marriages gradually gave way before the emerging practices of polygamy—polygyny and polyandry—among the more advanced tribes. But polyandry was never general, being usually limited to queens and rich women; furthermore, it was customarily a family affair, one wife for several brothers. Caste and economic restrictions sometimes made it necessary for several men to content themselves with one wife. Even then, the woman would marry only one, the others being loosely tolerated as ‘uncles’ of the joint progeny.” <a id="s2109_523"></a>[UB 83:5.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p5_2)

11. Monogamy is the ideal of sex life, but it demands self-control.

	> “Monogamy always has been, now is, and forever will be the idealistic goal of human sex evolution. This ideal of true pair marriage entails self-denial, and therefore does it so often fail just because one or both of the contracting parties are deficient in that acme of all human virtues, rugged self-control.” <a id="s2113_315"></a>[UB 83:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p6_6)

12. Monogamy is the yardstick which measures the advance of social civilization. It fosters the best in marriage for both parents and children.

	> “Monogamy is the yardstick which measures the advance of social civilization as distinguished from purely biologic evolution. Monogamy is not necessarily biologic or natural, but it is indispensable to the immediate maintenance and further development of social civilization. It contributes to a delicacy of sentiment, a refinement of moral character, and a spiritual growth which are utterly impossible in polygamy. A woman never can become an ideal mother when she is all the while compelled to engage in rivalry for her husband’s affections.
	> 
	> “Pair marriage favors and fosters that intimate understanding and effective co-operation which is best for parental happiness, child welfare, and social efficiency. Marriage, which began in crude coercion, is gradually evolving into a magnificent institution of self-culture, self-control, self-expression, and self-perpetuation.” <a id="s2119_334"></a>[UB 83:6.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p6_7)

13. Marriage is man’s most exalted institution, but it should not be considered a sacrament. Marriage is not consummated by divine action.

	> “Marriage which culminates in the home is indeed man’s most exalted institution, but it is essentially human; it should never have been called a sacrament. The Sethite priests made marriage a religious ritual; but for thousands of years after Eden, mating continued as a purely social and civil institution.
	> 
	> “The likening of human associations to divine associations is most unfortunate. The union of husband and wife in the marriage-home relationship is a material function of the mortals of the evolutionary worlds. True, indeed, much spiritual progress may accrue consequent upon the sincere human efforts of husband and wife to progress, but this does not mean that marriage is necessarily sacred. Spiritual progress is attendant upon sincere application to other avenues of human endeavor.” <a id="s2125_491"></a>[UB 83:8.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_1)

	> “It is also unfortunate that certain groups of mortals have conceived of marriage as being consummated by divine action. Such beliefs lead directly to the concept of the indissolubility of the marital state regardless of the circumstances or wishes of the contracting parties. But the very fact of marriage dissolution itself indicates that Deity is not a conjoining party to such unions. If God has once joined any two things or persons together, they will remain thus joined until such a time as the divine will decrees their separation. But, regarding marriage, which is a human institution, who shall presume to sit in judgment, to say which marriages are unions that might be approved by the universe supervisors in contrast with those which are purely human in nature and origin?” <a id="s2127_790"></a>[UB 83:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_4)

14. Marriage was the result of the attachment of primitive woman to her offspring and of food hunger of primitive man.

	> “Marriage was not founded on sex relations; they were incidental thereto. Marriage was not needed by primitive man, who indulged his sex appetite freely without encumbering himself with the responsibilities of wife, children, and home.
	> 
	> “Woman, because of physical and emotional attachment to her offspring, is dependent on co-operation with the male, and this urges her into the sheltering protection of marriage. But no direct biologic urge led man into marriage—much less held him in. It was not love that made marriage attractive to man, but food hunger which first attracted savage man to woman and the primitive shelter shared by her children.” <a id="s2133_417"></a>[UB 84:1.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_1)

15. The mother-child association was the nucleus from which marriage and the home sprang.

	> “While the mother-child association is neither marriage nor home, it was the nucleus from which both sprang. The great advance in the evolution of mating came when these temporary partnerships lasted long enough to rear the resultant offspring, for that was homemaking.” <a id="s2137_274"></a>[UB 84:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_8)

16. Chances of survival were improved by the male-female partnership.

	> “Regardless of the antagonisms of these early pairs, notwithstanding the looseness of the association, the chances for survival were greatly improved by these male-female partnerships. A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women. This pairing of the sexes enhanced survival and was the very beginning of human society. The sex division of labor also made for comfort and increased happiness.” <a id="s2141_487"></a>[UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9)

17. The change from the mother-family to the father-family was a radical readjustment that led to improved social improvement.

	> “With the passing of the hunter mores, when herding gave man control of the chief food supply, the mother-family came to a speedy end. It failed simply because it could not successfully compete with the newer father-family. Power lodged with the male relatives of the mother could not compete with power concentrated in the husband-father. Woman was not equal to the combined tasks of childbearing and of exercising continuous authority and increasing domestic power. The oncoming of wife stealing and later wife purchase hastened the passing of the mother-family.
	> 
	> “The stupendous change from the mother-family to the father-family is one of the most radical and complete right-about-face adjustments ever executed by the human race. This change led at once to greater social expression and increased family adventure.” <a id="s2147_258"></a>[UB 84:2.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_6)

18. Woman’s status reflected the type of society and the degree of development of civilization. As man changed from hunter to herdsman, her status changed, but was improved when man became agriculturist.

	> “It may be that the instinct of motherhood led woman into marriage, but it was man’s superior strength, together with the influence of the mores, that virtually compelled her to remain in wedlock. Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of family life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitary authority of the father. All society, whether national or familial, passed through the stage of the autocratic authority of a patriarchal order.” <a id="s2151_549"></a>[UB 84:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_1)

	> “But man was no more to blame for his low opinion of woman during past ages than was woman herself. She failed to get social recognition during primitive times because she did not function in an emergency; she was not a spectacular or crisis hero. Maternity was a distinct disability in the existence struggle; mother love handicapped women in the tribal defense.” <a id="s2153_368"></a>[UB 84:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_3)

	> “Among the more advanced races, women are not so large or so strong as men. Woman, being the weaker, therefore became the more tactful; she early learned to trade upon her sex charms. She became more alert and conservative than man, though slightly less profound. Man was woman’s superior on the battlefield and in the hunt; but at home woman has usually outgeneraled even the most primitive of men.
	> 
	> “The herdsman looked to his flocks for sustenance, but throughout these pastoral ages woman must still provide the vegetable food. Primitive man shunned the soil; it was altogether too peaceful, too unadventuresome. There was also an old superstition that women could raise better plants; they were mothers. In many backward tribes today, the men cook the meat, the women the vegetables, and when the primitive tribes of Australia are on the march, the women never attack game, while a man would not stoop to dig a root.” <a id="s2157_525"></a>[UB 84:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_5)

	> “Woman’s first liberation came when man consented to till the soil, consented to do what had theretofore been regarded as woman’s work. It was a great step forward when male captives were no longer killed but were enslaved as agriculturists. This brought about the liberation of woman so that she could devote more time to homemaking and child culture.
	> 
	> “The provision of milk for the young led to earlier weaning of babies, hence to the bearing of more children by the mothers thus relieved of their sometimes temporary barrenness, while the use of cow’s milk and goat’s milk greatly reduced infant mortality. Before the herding stage of society, mothers used to nurse their babies until they were four and five years old.
	> 
	> “Decreasing primitive warfare greatly lessened the disparity between the division of labor based on sex. But women still had to do the real work while men did picket duty. No camp or village could be left unguarded day or night, but even this task was alleviated by the domestication of the dog. In general, the coming of agriculture has enhanced woman’s prestige and social standing; at least this was true up to the time man himself turned agriculturist. And as soon as man addressed himself to the tilling of the soil, there immediately ensued great improvement in methods of agriculture, extending on down through successive generations. In hunting and war man had learned the value of organization, and he introduced these techniques into industry and later, when taking over much of woman’s work, greatly improved on her loose methods of labor.” <a id="s2163_855"></a>[UB 84:3.8-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_8)

	> “Generally speaking, during any age woman’s status is a fair criterion of the evolutionary progress of marriage as a social institution, while the progress of marriage itself is a reasonably accurate gauge registering the advances of human civilization.
	> 
	> “Woman’s status has always been a social paradox; she has always been a shrewd manager of men; she has always capitalized man’s stronger sex urge for her own interests and to her own advancement. By trading subtly upon her sex charms, she has often been able to exercise dominant power over man, even when held by him in abject slavery.” <a id="s2167_341"></a>[UB 84:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_1)

	> “Childbearing was once generally looked upon as rendering a woman dangerous and unclean. And many tribal mores decreed that a mother must undergo extensive purification ceremonies subsequent to the birth of a child. Except among those groups where the husband participated in the lying-in, the expectant mother was shunned, left alone. The ancients even avoided having a child born in the house. Finally, the old women were permitted to attend the mother during labor, and this practice gave origin to the profession of midwifery. During labor, scores of foolish things were said and done in an effort to facilitate delivery. It was the custom to sprinkle the newborn with holy water to prevent ghost interference.” <a id="s2169_719"></a>[UB 84:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_6)

	> “A great advance was made when a man was denied the right to kill his wife at will. Likewise, it was a forward step when a woman could own the wedding gifts. Later, she gained the legal right to own, control, and even dispose of property, but she was long deprived of the right to hold office in either church or state. Woman has always been treated more or less as property, right up to and in the twentieth century after Christ. She has not yet gained world-wide freedom from seclusion under man’s control. Even among advanced peoples, man’s attempt to protect woman has always been a tacit assertion of superiority.
	> 
	> “But primitive women did not pity themselves as their more recently liberated sisters are wont to do. They were, after all, fairly happy and contented; they did not dare to envision a better or different mode of existence.” <a id="s2173_227"></a>[UB 84:4.10-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_10)

19. The improvement of woman’s status was an unplanned episode of social evolution. Science, not religion, really emancipated woman.

	> “The modern idea of sex equality is beautiful and worthy of an expanding civilization, but it is not found in nature. When might is right, man lords it over woman; when more justice, peace, and fairness prevail, she gradually emerges from slavery and obscurity. Woman’s social position has generally varied inversely with the degree of militarism in any nation or age.
	> 
	> “But man did not consciously nor intentionally seize woman’s rights and then gradually and grudgingly give them back to her; all this was an unconscious and unplanned episode of social evolution. When the time really came for woman to enjoy added rights, she got them, and all quite regardless of man’s conscious attitude. Slowly but surely the mores change so as to provide for those social adjustments which are a part of the persistent evolution of civilization. The advancing mores slowly provided increasingly better treatment for females; those tribes which persisted in cruelty to them did not survive.” <a id="s2179_614"></a>[UB 84:5.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_3)

	> “Science, not religion, really emancipated woman; it was the modern factory which largely set her free from the confines of the home. Man’s physical abilities became no longer a vital essential in the new maintenance mechanism; science so changed the conditions of living that man power was no longer so superior to woman power.
	>
	> “These changes have tended toward woman’s liberation from domestic slavery and have brought about such a modification of her status that she now enjoys a degree of personal liberty and sex determination that practically equals man’s. Once a woman’s value consisted in her food-producing ability, but invention and wealth have enabled her to create a new world in which to function—spheres of grace and charm. Thus has industry won its unconscious and unintended fight for woman’s social and economic emancipation. And again has evolution succeeded in doing what even revelation failed to accomplish.” <a id="s2183_604"></a>[UB 84:5.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_7)

	> “In the ideals of pair marriage, woman has finally won recognition, dignity, independence, equality, and education; but will she prove worthy of all this new and unprecedented accomplishment? Will modern woman respond to this great achievement of social liberation with idleness, indifference, barrenness, and infidelity? Today, in the twentieth century, woman is undergoing the crucial test of her long world existence!” <a id="s2185_425"></a>[UB 84:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_10)

20. The partnership of man and woman.

	> “The reproductive urge unfailingly brings men and women together for self-perpetuation but, alone, does not insure their remaining together in mutual co-operation—the founding of a home.
	> 
	> “Every successful human institution embraces antagonisms of personal interest which have been adjusted to practical working harmony, and homemaking is no exception. Marriage, the basis of home building, is the highest manifestation of that antagonistic cooperation which so often characterizes the contacts of nature and society. The conflict is inevitable. Mating is inherent; it is natural. But marriage is not biologic; it is sociologic. Passion insures that man and woman will come together, but the weaker parental instinct and the social mores hold them together.” <a id="s2191_574"></a>[UB 84:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_1)

	> “The differences of nature, reaction, viewpoint, and thinking between men and women, far from occasioning concern, should be regarded as highly beneficial to mankind, both individually and collectively. Many orders of universe creatures are created in dual phases of personality manifestation. Among mortals, Material Sons, and midsoniters, this difference is described as male and female; among seraphim, cherubim, and Morontia Companions, it has been denominated positive or aggressive and negative or retiring. Such dual associations greatly multiply versatility and overcome inherent limitations, even as do certain triune associations in the Paradise-Havona system.” <a id="s2193_675"></a>[UB 84:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_5)

	> “Men and women need each other in their morontial and spiritual as well as in their mortal careers. The differences in viewpoint between male and female persist even beyond the first life and throughout the local and superuniverse ascensions. And even in Havona, the pilgrims who were once men and women will still be aiding each other in the Paradise ascent. Never, even in the Corps of the Finality, will the creature metamorphose so far as to obliterate the personality trends that humans call male and female; always will these two basic variations of humankind continue to intrigue, stimulate, encourage, and assist each other; always will they be mutually dependent on co-operation in the solution of perplexing universe problems and in the overcoming of manifold cosmic difficulties.” <a id="s2195_795"></a>[UB 84:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_6)

21. The great threat against marriage is the rising tide of selfgratification.

	> “The great threat against family life is the menacing rising tide of self-gratification, the modern pleasure mania. The prime incentive to marriage used to be economic; sex attraction was secondary. Marriage, founded on self-maintenance, led to self-perpetuation and concomitantly provided one of the most desirable forms of self-gratification. It is the only institution of human society which embraces all three of the great incentives for living.” <a id="s2199_454"></a>[UB 84:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_1)

22. The pleasure mania threatens all of our social institutions especially the home.

	> “Originally, property was the basic institution of self-maintenance, while marriage functioned as the unique institution of self-perpetuation. Although food satisfaction, play, and humor, along with periodic sex indulgence, were means of self-gratification, it remains a fact that the evolving mores have failed to build any distinct institution of self-gratification. And it is due to this failure to evolve specialized techniques of pleasurable enjoyment that all human institutions are so completely shot through with this pleasure pursuit. Property accumulation is becoming an instrument for augmenting all forms of self-gratification, while marriage is often viewed only as a means of pleasure. And this overindulgence, this widely spread pleasure mania, now constitutes the greatest threat that has ever been leveled at the social evolutionary institution of family life, the home.” <a id="s2203_892"></a>[UB 84:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_2)

23. The chief pleasures should be found in play, humor, and food—not in sex gratification.

	> “The violet race introduced a new and only imperfectly realized characteristic into the experience of humankind—the play instinct coupled with the sense of humor. It was there in measure in the Sangiks and Andonites, but the Adamic strain elevated this primitive propensity into the _potential of pleasure_, a new and glorified form of self-gratification. The basic type of self-gratification, aside from appeasing hunger, is sex gratification, and this form of sensual pleasure was enormously heightened by the blending of the Sangiks and the Andites.” <a id="s2207_557"></a>[UB 84:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_3)

#### H. Religion and fear.

1. Fear and ignorance in relation to worship.

	> “At one time or another mortal man has worshiped everything on the face of the earth, including himself. He has also worshiped about everything imaginable in the sky and beneath the surface of the earth. Primitive man feared all manifestations of power; he worshipped every natural phenomenon he could not comprehend. The observation of powerful natural forces, such as storms, floods, earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes, fire, heat, and cold, greatly impressed the expanding mind of man. The inexplicable things of life are still termed ‘acts of God’ and ‘mysterious dispensations of Providence.’” <a id="s2213_602"></a>[UB 85:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p0_4)

2. Fear and uncertainty contributed to making man a gambler.

	> “Early man lived in uncertainty and in constant fear of chance-bad luck. Life was an exciting game of chance; existence was a gamble. It is no wonder that partially civilized people still believe in chance and evince lingering predispositions to gambling. Primitive man alternated between two potent interests: the passion of getting something for nothing and the fear of getting nothing for something. And this gamble of existence was the main interest and the supreme fascination of the early savage mind.” <a id="s2217_512"></a>[UB 86:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p1_4)

3. The mystery of natural death fostered religion among primitive men.

	> “Death was the supreme shock to evolving man, the most perplexing combination of chance and mystery. Not the sanctity of life but the shock of death inspired fear and thus effectively fostered religion. Among savage peoples death was ordinarily due to violence, so that nonviolent death became increasingly mysterious. Death as a natural and expected end of life was not clear to the consciousness of primitive people, and it has required age upon age for man to realize its inevitability.” <a id="s2221_494"></a>[UB 86:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p3_1)

4. Early man accepted life as a fact, death as a visitation of some sort.

	> “Early man accepted life as a fact, while he regarded death as a visitation of some sort. All races have their legends of men who did not die, vestigial traditions of the early attitude toward death. Already in the human mind there existed the nebulous concept of a hazy and unorganized spirit world, a domain whence came all that is inexplicable in human life, and death was added to this long list of unexplained phenomena.” <a id="s2225_430"></a>[UB 86:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p3_2)

5. Death and disease were believed to be due to spirit influences.

	> “All human disease and natural death was at first believed to be due to spirit influence. Even at the present time some civilized races regard disease as having been produced by ‘the enemy’ and depend upon religious ceremonies to effect healing. Later and more complex systems of theology still ascribe death to the action of the spirit world, all of which has led to such doctrines as original sin and the fall of man.” <a id="s2229_424"></a>[UB 86:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p3_3)

6. Death-survival concepts.

	> “Early man entertained no ideas of hell or future punishment. The savage looked upon the future life as just like this one, minus all ill luck. Later on, a separate destiny for good ghosts and bad ghosts—heaven and hell—was conceived. But since many primitive races believed that man entered the next life just as he left this one, they did not relish the idea of becoming old and decrepit. The aged much preferred to be killed before becoming too infirm.
	> 
	> “Almost every group had a different idea regarding the destiny of the ghost soul. The Greeks believed that weak men must have weak souls; so they invented Hades as a fit place for the reception of such anemic souls; these unrobust specimens were also supposed to have shorter shadows. The early Andites thought their ghosts returned to the ancestral homelands. The Chinese and Egyptians once believed that soul and body remained together. Among the Egyptians this led to careful tomb construction and efforts at body preservation. Even modern peoples seek to arrest the decay of the dead. The Hebrews conceived that a phantom replica of the individual went down to Sheol; it could not return to the land of the living. They did make that important advance in the doctrine of the evolution of the soul.” <a id="s2235_806"></a>[UB 86:4.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_7)

7. Early man’s belief in ghosts and spirits led to superstition and this constituted man’s only religion until the times of revelation.

	> “Very early in the history of mankind the realities of the imaginary world of ghosts and spirits became universally believed, and this newly imagined spirit world became a power in primitive society. The mental and moral life of all mankind was modified for all time by the appearance of this new factor in human thinking and acting.
	> 
	> “Into this major premise of illusion and ignorance, mortal fear has packed all of the subsequent superstition and religion of primitive peoples. This was man’s only religion up to the times of revelation, and today many of the world’s races have only this crude religion of evolution.” <a id="s2241_289"></a>[UB 86:6.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p6_2)

8. To the savage, religion was the payment of premiums on insurance against bad luck.

	> “The savage felt the need of insurance, and he therefore willingly paid his burdensome premiums of fear, superstition, dread, and priest gifts toward his policy of magic insurance against ill luck. Primitive religion was simply the payment of premiums on insurance against the perils of the forests; civilized man pays material premiums against the accidents of industry and the exigencies of modern modes of living.” <a id="s2245_421"></a>[UB 86:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p7_1)

### I. Cults and priests.

1. The origin, nature, and mission of cults.

	> “The cult type of social organization persisted because it provided a symbolism for the preservation and stimulation of moral sentiments and religious loyalties. The cult grew out of the traditions of ‘old families’ and was perpetuated as an established institution; all families have a cult of some sort. Every inspiring ideal grasps for some perpetuating symbolism—seeks some technique for cultural manifestation which will insure survival and augment realization—and the cult achieves this end by fostering and gratifying emotion.” <a id="s2251_538"></a>[UB 87:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_1)

2. The good and the evil associated with cults.

	> “From the dawn of civilization every appealing movement in social culture or religious advancement has developed a ritual, a symbolic ceremonial. The more this ritual has been an unconscious growth, the stronger it has gripped its devotees. The cult preserved sentiment and satisfied emotion, but it has always been the greatest obstacle to social reconstruction and spiritual progress.” <a id="s2255_391"></a>[UB 87:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_2)

3. Though cults retarded social progress, they provided mutual support—something to belong to.

	> “Notwithstanding that the cult has always retarded social progress, it is regrettable that so many modern believers in moral standards and spiritual ideals have no adequate symbolism—no cult of mutual support—nothing to _belong_ to. But a religious cult cannot be manufactured; it must grow. And those of no two groups will be identical unless their rituals are arbitrarily standardized by authority.” <a id="s2259_405"></a>[UB 87:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_3)

4. The effective Christian cult has lost many of its fundamental ideas.

	> “The early Christian cult was the most effective, appealing, and enduring of any ritual ever conceived or devised, but much of its value has been destroyed in a scientific age by the destruction of so many of its original underlying tenets. The Christian cult has been devitalized by the loss of many fundamental ideas.” <a id="s2263_324"></a>[UB 87:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_4)

5. In olden times man attempted to do by magic what in modern times he achieves by science.

	> “Civilized man attacks the problems of a real environment through his science; savage man attempted to solve the real problems of an illusory ghost environment by magic. Magic was the technique of manipulating the conjectured spirit environment whose machinations endlessly explained the inexplicable; it was the art of obtaining voluntary spirit co-operation and of coercing involuntary spirit aid through the use of fetishes or other and more powerful spirits.” <a id="s2267_467"></a>[UB 88:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p4_1)

6. Magic evolves into science.

	> “Magic was the branch off the evolutionary religious tree which eventually bore the fruit of a scientific age. Belief in astrology led to the development of astronomy; belief in a philosopher’s stone led to the mastery of metals, while belief in magic numbers founded the science of mathematics.” <a id="s2271_300"></a>[UB 88:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p6_5)

7. The technique of ritual was all important—hence the evolution of ritual specialists—priests.

	> “The essence of the ritual is the perfection of its performance; among savages it must be practiced with exact precision. It is only when the ritual has been correctly carried out that the ceremony possesses compelling power over the spirits. If the ritual is faulty, it only arouses the anger and resentment of the gods. Therefore, since man’s slowly evolving mind conceived that the _technique of ritual_ was the decisive factor in its efficacy, it was inevitable that the early shamans should sooner or later evolve into a priesthood trained to direct the meticulous practice of the ritual. And so for tens of thousands of years endless rituals have hampered society and cursed civilization, have been an intolerable burden to every act of life, every racial undertaking.” <a id="s2275_779"></a>[UB 90:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p5_1)

8. Rituals sanctify custom, perpetuate myths, and dignify religious ceremonials.

	> “Ritual is the technique of sanctifying custom; ritual creates and perpetuates myths as well as contributing to the preservation of social and religious customs. Again, ritual itself has been fathered by myths. Rituals are often at first social, later becoming economic and finally acquiring the sanctity and dignity of religious ceremonial. Ritual may be personal or group in practice-or both—as illustrated by prayer, dancing, and drama.” <a id="s2279_444"></a>[UB 90:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p5_2)

9. While priests have delayed science and hindered spiritual progress, they have helped stabilize civilization and enhance culture.

	> “The priesthoods have done much to delay scientific development and to hinder spiritual progress, but they have contributed to the stabilization of civilization and to the enhancement of certain kinds of culture. But many modern priests have ceased to function as directors of the ritual of the worship of God, having turned their attention to theology—the attempt to define God.
	> 
	> “It is not denied that the priests have been a millstone about the neck of the races, but the true religious leaders have been invaluable in pointing the way to higher and better realities.” <a id="s2285_194"></a>[UB 90:5.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p5_7)

### II. **The Maintenance of Civilization**

#### A. The civilization which is now evolving on Urantia grew out of, and is predicated on, the following factors:

1. “_Natural circumstances_. The nature and extent of a material civilization is in large measure determined by the natural resources available. Climate, weather, and numerous physical conditions are factors in the evolution of culture.” <a id="s2291_238"></a>[UB 81:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_3)

2. “_Capital goods_. Culture is never developed under conditions of poverty; leisure is essential to the progress of civilization. Individual character of moral and spiritual value may be acquired in the absence of material wealth, but a cultural civilization is only derived from those conditions of material prosperity which foster leisure combined with ambition.” <a id="s2293_367"></a>[UB 81:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_6)

3. “_Scientific knowledge_. The material aspects of civilization must always await the accumulation of scientific data. It was a long time after the discovery of the bow and arrow and the utilization of animals for power purposes before man learned how to harness wind and water, to be followed by the employment of steam and electricity. But slowly the tools of civilization improved. Weaving, pottery, the domestication of animals, and metalworking were followed by an age of writing and printing. “Knowledge is power. Invention always precedes the acceleration of cultural development on a world-wide scale. Science and invention benefited most of all from the printing press, and the interaction of all these cultural and inventive activities has enormously accelerated the rate of cultural advancement.” <a id="s2295_809"></a>[UB 81:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_8)

4. “_Human resources_. Man power is indispensable to the spread of civilization. All things equal, a numerous people will dominate the civilization of a smaller race. Hence failure to increase in numbers up to a certain point prevents the full realization of national destiny, but there comes a point in population increase where further growth is suicidal. Multiplication of numbers beyond the optimum of the normal man-land ratio means either a lowering of the standards of living or an immediate expansion of territorial boundaries by peaceful penetration or by military conquest, forcible occupation.

	> “You are sometimes shocked at the ravages of war, but you should recognize the necessity for producing large numbers of mortals so as to afford ample opportunity for social and moral development; with such planetary fertility there soon occurs the serious problem of overpopulation. Most of the inhabited worlds are small. Urantia is average, perhaps a trifle undersized. The optimum stabilization of national population enhances culture and prevents war. And it is a wise nation which knows when to cease growing.” <a id="s2299_519"></a>[UB 81:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_11)

5. “_Effectiveness of material resources_. Much depends on the wisdom displayed in the utilization of natural resources, scientific knowledge, capital goods, and human potentials. The chief factor in early civilization was the _force_ exerted by wise social masters; primitive man had civilization literally thrust upon him by his superior contemporaries. Well-organized and superior minorities have largely ruled this world.

	> “Might does not make right, but might does make what is and what has been in history. Only recently has Urantia reached that point where society is willing to debate the ethics of might and right.” <a id="s2303_201"></a>[UB 81:6.14-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_14)

6. “_Effectiveness of language_. The spread of civilization must wait upon language. Live and growing languages insure the expansion of civilized thinking and planning. During the early ages important advances were made in language. Today, there is great need for further linguistic development to facilitate the expression of evolving thought.” <a id="s2305_346"></a>[UB 81:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_16)

7. “_Effectiveness of mechanical devices_. The progress of civilization is directly related to the development and possession of tools, machines, and channels of distribution. Improved tools, ingenious and efficient machines, determine the survival of contending groups in the arena of advancing civilization.” <a id="s2307_311"></a>[UB 81:6.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_20)

8. “_Character of torchbearers_. Social inheritance enables man to stand on the shoulders of all who have preceded him, and who have contributed aught to the sum of culture and knowledge. In this work of passing on the cultural torch to the next generation, the home will ever be the basic institution. The play and social life comes next, with the school last but equally indispensable in a complex and highly organized society.” <a id="s2309_431"></a>[UB 81:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_23)

9. “_The racial ideals_. The ideals of one generation carve out the channels of destiny for immediate posterity. The _quality_ of the social torchbearers will determine whether civilization goes forward or backward. The homes, churches, and schools of one generation predetermine the character trend of the succeeding generation. The moral and spiritual momentum of a race or a nation largely determines the cultural velocity of that civilization.” <a id="s2311_449"></a>[UB 81:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_26)

10. “_Co-ordination of specialists_. Civilization has been enormously advanced by the early division of labor and by its later corollary of specialization. Civilization is now dependent on the effective co-ordination of specialists. As society expands, some method of drawing together the various specialists must be found.” <a id="s2313_325"></a>[UB 81:6.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_29)

11. “_Place-finding devices_. The next age of social development will be embodied in a better and more effective co-operation and coordination of ever-increasing and expanding specialization. And as labor more and more diversifies, some technique for directing individuals to suitable employment must be devised. Machinery is not the only cause for unemployment among the civilized peoples of Urantia. Economic complexity and the steady increase of industrial and professional specialism add to the problems of labor placement.” <a id="s2315_529"></a>[UB 81:6.31](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_31)

12. “_The willingness to co-operate_. One of the great hindrances to the progress of human society is the conflict between the interests and welfare of the larger, more socialized human groups and of the smaller, contrary-minded asocial associations of mankind, not to mention antisocially-minded single individuals.” <a id="s2317_318"></a>[UB 81:6.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_34)

	> “The maintenance of world-wide civilization is dependent on human beings learning how to live together in peace and fraternity. Without effective co-ordination, industrial civilization is jeopardized by the dangers of ultraspecialization: monotony, narrowness, and the tendency to breed distrust and jealousy.” <a id="s2319_314"></a>[UB 81:6.36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_36)

13. “_Effective and wise leadership_. In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective load-pulling spirit. Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together—all at the same moment. And such teamwork—social co-operation—is dependent on leadership. The cultural civilizations of the past and the present have been based upon the intelligent co-operation of the citizenry with wise and progressive leaders; and until man evolves to higher levels, civilization will continue to be dependent on wise and vigorous leadership.” <a id="s2321_589"></a>[UB 81:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_36)

14. “_Social changes_. Society is not a divine institution; it is a phenomenon of progressive evolution; and advancing civilization is always delayed when its leaders are slow in making those changes in the social organization which are essential to keeping pace with the scientific developments of the age. For all that, things must not be despised just because they are old, neither should an idea be unconditionally embraced just because it is novel and new.” <a id="s2323_463"></a>[UB 81:6.39](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_39)

15. “_The prevention of transitional breakdown_. Society is the offspring of age upon age of trial and error; it is what survived the selective adjustments and readjustments in the successive stages of mankind’s agelong rise from animal to human levels of planetary status. The great danger to any civilization—at any one moment-is the threat of breakdown during the time of transition from the established methods of the past to those new and better, but untried, procedures of the future.” <a id="s2325_492"></a>[UB 81:6.41](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_41)

#### B. Education.

1. The purpose of education; the function of education in an ideal state.

	> “The enduring state is founded on culture, dominated by ideals, and motivated by service. The purpose of education should be acquirement of skill, pursuit of wisdom, realization of selfhood, and attainment of spiritual values.
	> 
	> “In the ideal state, education continues throughout life, and philosophy sometime becomes the chief pursuit of its citizens. The citizens of such a commonwealth pursue wisdom as an enhancement of insight into the significance of human relations, the meanings of reality, the nobility of values, the goals of living, and the glories of cosmic destiny.” <a id="s2333_355"></a>[UB 71:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p7_1)

2. Education is the business of living. It ascends to the seven insights of wisdom and God-consciousness.

	> “Education is the business of living; it must continue throughout a lifetime so that mankind may gradually experience the ascending levels of mortal wisdom, which are:
	> “1. The knowledge of things.
	> “2. The realization of meanings.
	> “3. The appreciation of values.
	> “4. The nobility of work—duty.
	> “5. The motivation of goals—morality.
	> “6. The love of service—character.
	> “7. Cosmic insight—spiritual discernment.
	> “And then, by means of these achievements, many will ascend to the mortal ultimate of mind attainment, God-consciousness.” <a id="s2345_126"></a>[UB 71:7.5-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p7_5)

## SECTION 8. THE CULMINATION OF HUMAN EVOLUTION

### I. **Religion in Human Experience**

#### A. Man’s spiritual estate.

1. Religion ranges from the lowest to the highest in human nature-it is the inspiration of human evolution.

	> “Religion, as a human experience, ranges from the primitive fear slavery of the evolving savage up to the sublime and magnificent faith liberty of those civilized mortals who are superbly conscious of sonship with the eternal God.
	> 
	> “Religion is the ancestor of the advanced ethics and morals of progressive social evolution. But religion, as such, is not merely a moral movement, albeit the outward and social manifestations of religion are mightily influenced by the ethical and moral momentum of human society. Always is religion the inspiration of man’s evolving nature, but it is not the secret of that evolution.” <a id="s2357_390"></a>[UB 101:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p0_1)

2. The mechanistic despair of a bewildered soul can be dispelled by one stretch of faith.

	> “To the unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man’s only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.
	> 
	> “But such is not man’s end and eternal destiny; such a vision is but the cry of despair uttered by some wandering soul who has become lost in spiritual darkness, and who bravely struggles on in the face of the mechanistic sophistries of a material philosophy, blinded by the confusion and distortion of a complex learning. And all this doom of darkness and all this destiny of despair are forever dispelled by one brave stretch of faith on the part of the most humble and unlearned of God’s children on earth.” <a id="s2363_514"></a>[UB 102:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p0_1)

3. Philosophy is the mediator between science and religion.

	> “The union of the scientific attitude and the religious insight by the mediation of experiential philosophy is part of man’s long Paradise-ascension experience. The approximations of mathematics and the certainties of insight will always require the harmonizing function of mind logic on all levels of experience short of the maximum attainment of the Supreme.” <a id="s2367_365"></a>[UB 103:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_4)

4. Without truth insight, logic can never reconcile science and religion.

	> “But logic can never succeed in harmonizing the findings of science and the insights of religion unless both the scientific and the religious aspects of a personality are truth dominated, sincerely desirous of following the truth wherever it may lead regardless of the conclusions which it may reach.” <a id="s2371_305"></a>[UB 103:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_5)

5. The interworking of logic, reason, and religious faith in human experience.

	> “Logic is the technique of philosophy, its method of expression. Within the domain of true science, reason is always amenable to genuine logic; within the domain of true religion, faith is always logical from the basis of an inner viewpoint, even though such faith may appear to be quite unfounded from the inlooking viewpoint of the scientific approach. From outward, looking within, the universe may appear to be material; from within, looking out, the same universe appears to be wholly spiritual. Reason grows out of material awareness, faith out of spiritual awareness, but through the mediation of a philosophy strengthened by revelation, logic may confirm both the inward and the outward view, thereby effecting the stabilization of both science and religion. Thus, through common contact with the logic of philosophy, may both science and religion become increasingly tolerant of each other, less and less skeptical.” <a id="s2375_929"></a>[UB 103:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_6)

6. Both science and religion need more self-criticism.

	> “What both developing science and religion need is more searching and fearless self-criticism a greater awareness of incompleteness in evolutionary status. The teachers of both science and religion are often altogether too self-confident and dogmatic. Science and religion can only be self-critical of their _facts_. The moment departure is made from the stage of facts, reason abdicates or else rapidly degenerates into a consort of false logic.” <a id="s2379_451"></a>[UB 103:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_7)

7. Revelation assists philosophy in co-ordinating science and religion.

	> “The science of the material world enables man to control, and to some extent dominate, his physical environment. The religion of the spiritual experience is the source of the fraternity impulse which enables men to live together in the complexities of the civilization of a scientic age. Metaphysics, but more certainly revelation, affords a common meeting ground for the discoveries of both science and religion and makes possible the human attempt logically to correlate these separate but interdependent domains of thought into a well-balanced philosophy of scientific stability and religious certainty.” <a id="s2383_612"></a>[UB 103:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_9)

8. Both science and religion are founded on assumptions.

	> “In the mortal state, nothing can be absolutely proved; both science and religion are predicated on assumptions. On the morontia level, the postulates of both science and religion are capable of partial proof by mota logic. On the spiritual level of maximum status, the need for finite proof gradually vanishes before the actual experience of and with reality; but even then there is much beyond the finite that remains unproved.” <a id="s2387_434"></a>[UB 103:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_10)

9. The basic assumptions of science and religion.

	> “All divisions of human thought are predicated on certain assumptions which are accepted, though unproved, by the constitutive reality sensitivity of the mind endowment of man. Science starts out on its vaunted career of reasoning by _assuming_ the reality of three things: matter, motion, and life. Religion starts out with the assumption of the validity of three things: mind, spirit, and the universe—the Supreme Being.” <a id="s2391_427"></a>[UB 103:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_11)

10. Vastness of the problem of the unification of the material and the spiritual.

	> “Science becomes the thought domain of mathematics, of the energy and material of time in space. Religion assumes to deal not only with finite and temporal spirit but also with the spirit of eternity and supremacy. Only through a long experience in mota can these two extremes of universe perception be made to yield analogous interpretations of origins, functions, relations, realities, and destinies. The maximum harmonization of the energy-spirit divergence is in the encircuitment of the Seven Master Spirits; the first unification thereof, in the Deity of the Supreme; the finality unity thereof, in the infinity of the First Source and Center, the I AM.” <a id="s2395_664"></a>[UB 103:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_12)

11. The nature, mission, and limitations of revelation.

	> “Revelation is evolutionary but always progressive. Down through the ages of a world’s history, the revelations of religion are ever-expanding and successively more enlightening. It is the mission of revelation to sort and censor the successive religions of evolution. But if revelation is to exalt and upstep the religions of evolution, then must such divine visitations portray teachings which are not too far removed from the thought and reactions of the age in which they are presented. Thus must and does revelation always keep in touch with evolution. Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man’s capacity of receptivity.” <a id="s2399_646"></a>[UB 92:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_1)

#### B. The acme of religious living.

1. A portrait of the personality of Jesus.

	> “Jesus was an unusually cheerful person, but he was not a blind and unreasoning optimist. His constant word of exhortation was, ‘Be of good cheer.’ He could maintain this confident attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and his unshakable confidence in man. He was always touchingly considerate of all men because he loved them and believed in them. Still he was always true to his convictions and magnificently firm in his devotion to the doing of his Father’s will.
	> 
	> “The Master was always generous. He never grew weary of saying, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ Said he, ‘Freely you have received, freely give.’ And yet, with all of his unbounded generosity, he was never wasteful or extravagant. He taught that you must believe to receive salvation. ‘For every one who seeks shall receive.’
	> 
	> “He was candid, but always kind. Said he, ‘If it were not so, I would have told you.’ He was frank, but always friendly. He was outspoken in his love for the sinner and in his hatred for sin. But throughout all this amazing frankness he was unerringly _fair._
	> 
	> “Jesus was consistently cheerful, notwithstanding he sometimes drank deeply of the cup of human sorrow. He fearlessly faced the realities of existence, yet was he filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom. But he controlled his enthusiasm; it never controlled him. He was unreservedly dedicated to ‘the Father’s business.’ This divine enthusiasm led his unspiritual brethren to think he was beside himself, but the onlooking universe appraised him as the model of sanity and the pattern of supreme mortal devotion to the high standards of spiritual living. And his controlled enthusiasm was contagious; his associates were constrained to share his divine optimism.
	> 
	> “This man of Galilee was not a man of sorrows; he was a soul of gladness. Always was he saying, ‘Rejoice and be exceedingly glad.’ But when duty required, he was willing to walk courageously through the ‘valley of the shadow of death.’ He was gladsome but at the same time humble.
	> 
	> “His courage was equaled only by his patience. When pressed to act prematurely, he would only reply, ‘My hour has not yet come.’ He was never in a hurry; his composure was sublime. But he was often indignant at evil, intolerant of sin. He was often mightily moved to resist that which was inimical to the welfare of his children on earth. But his indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.
	> 
	> “His courage was magnificent, but he was never foolhardy. His watchword was, ‘Fear not.’ His bravery was lofty and his courage often heroic. But his courage was linked with discretion and controlled by reason. It was courage born of faith, not the recklessness of blind presumption. He was truly brave but never audacious.
	> 
	> “The Master was a pattern of reverence. The prayer of even his youth began, ‘Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed by your name.’ He was even respectful of the faulty worship of his fellows. But this did not deter him from making attacks on religious traditions or assaulting errors of human belief. He was reverential of true holiness, and yet he could justly appeal to his fellows, saying, ‘Who among you convicts me of sin?’
	> 
	> “Jesus was great because he was good, and yet he fraternized with the little children. He was gentle and unassuming in his personal life, and yet he was the perfected man of a universe. His associates called him Master unbidden.
	> 
	> “Jesus was the perfectly unified human personality. And today, as in Galilee, he continues to unify mortal experience and to coordinate human endeavors. He unifies life, ennobles character, and simplifies experience. He enters the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it. It is literally true: ‘If any man has Christ Jesus within him, he is a new creature; old things are passing away; behold, all things are becoming new.’” <a id="s2423_441"></a>[UB 100:7.9-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_9)

### II. **Human Destiny**

#### A. Evolutionary ascension.

1. The evolutionary destiny of human beings.

	> “The evolutionary planets are the spheres of human origin, the initial worlds of the ascending mortal career. Urantia is your starting point; here you and your divine Thought Adjuster are joined in temporary union. You have been endowed with a perfect guide; therefore, if you will sincerely run the race of time and gain the final goal of faith, the reward of the ages shall be yours; you will be eternally united with your indwelling Adjuster. Then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule. Then will begin your exalted and progressive mission as finaliters in the eternity which stretches out before you. And throughout all of these successive ages and stages of evolutionary growth, there is one part of you that remains absolutely unaltered, and that is personality —permanence in the presence of change.” <a id="s2431_876"></a>[UB 112:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_1)

2. The ministry of angels.

	“The Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men through many celestial forces and agencies but chiefly through the ministry of seraphim.

	> “At noon today the roll call of planetary angels, guardians, and others on Urantia was 501,234,619 pairs of seraphim. There were assigned to my command two hundred seraphic hosts—597,196,800 pairs of seraphim, or 1,194,393,600 individual angels. The registry, however, shows 1,002,469,238 individuals; it follows therefore that 191,924,362 angels were absent from this world on transport, messenger, and death duty. (On Urantia there are about the same number of cherubim as seraphim, and they are similarly organized.)
	> 
	> “Seraphim and their associated cherubim have much to do with the details of the superhuman government of a planet, especially of worlds which have been isolated by rebellion. The angels, ably assisted by the midwayers, function on Urantia as the actual supermaterial ministers who execute the mandates of the resident governor general and all his associates and subordinates. Seraphim as a class are occupied with many assignments other than those of personal and group guardianship.” <a id="s2439_488"></a>[UB 114:0.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_2)

3. The nature, mission, and composition of the reserve corps of destiny.

	> “The reserve corps of destiny consists of living men and women who have been admitted to the special service of the superhuman administration of world affairs. This corps is made up of the men and women of each generation who are chosen by the spirit directors of the realm to assist in the conduct of the ministry of mercy and wisdom to the children of time on the evolutionary worlds. It is the general practice in the conduct of the affairs of the ascension plans to begin this liaison utilization of mortal will creatures immediately they are competent and trustworthy to assume such responsibilities. Accordingly, as soon as men and women appear on the stage of temporal action with sufficient mental capacity, adequate moral status, and requisite spirituality, they are quickly assigned to the appropriate celestial group of planetary personalities as human liaisons, mortal assistants.
	> 
	> “When human beings are chosen as protectors of planetary destiny, when they become pivotal individuals in the plans which the world administrators are prosecuting, at that time the planetary chief of seraphim confirms their temporal attachment to the seraphic corps and appoints personal destiny guardians to serve with these mortal reservists. All reservists have self-conscious Adjusters, and most of them function in the higher cosmic circles of intellectual achievement and spiritual attainment.
	> 
	> “Mortals of the realm are chosen for service in the reserve corps of destiny on the inhabited worlds because of:
	> “1. Special capacity for being secretly rehearsed for numerous possible emergency missions in the conduct of various activities of world affairs.
	> “2. Wholehearted dedication to some special social, economic, political, spiritual, or other cause, coupled with willingness to serve without human recognition and rewards.
	> “3. The possession of a Thought Adjuster of extraordinary versatility and probable pre-Urantia experience in coping with planetary difficulties and contending with impending world emergency situations.” <a id="s2450_206"></a>[UB 114:7.1-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_1)

4. Nature and mission of Thought Adjusters.

	> “The Adjusters are the actuality of the Father’s love incarnate in the souls of men; they are the veritable promise of man’s eternal career imprisoned within the mortal mind; they are the essence of man’s perfected finaliter personality, which he can foretaste in time as he progressively masters the divine technique of achieving the living of the Father’s will, step by step, through the ascension of universe upon universe until he actually attains the divine presence of his Paradise Father.
	> 
	> “God, having commanded man to be perfect, even as he is perfect, has descended as the Adjuster to become man’s experiential partner in the achievement of the supernal destiny which has been thus ordained. The fragment of God which indwells the mind of man is the absolute and unqualified assurance that man can find the Universal Father in association with this divine Adjuster, which came forth from God to find man and sonship him even in the days of the flesh.” <a id="s2456_468"></a>[UB 107:0.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_2)

#### B. The triumph of faith.

1. Man liberated by religion becomes conscious of the fact that the divine hosts of the universes are on his side.

	> “When you experience such a transformation of faith, you are no longer a slavish part of the mathematical cosmos but rather a liberated volitional son of the Universal Father. No longer is such a liberated son fighting alone against the inexorable doom of the termination of temporal existence; no longer does he combat all nature, with the odds hopelessly against him; no longer is he staggered by the paralyzing fear that, perchance, he has put his trust in a hopeless phantasm or pinned his faith to a fanciful error.
	> 
	> “Now, rather, are the sons of God enlisted together in fighting the battle of reality’s triumph over the partial shadows of existence. At last all creatures become conscious of the fact that God and all the divine hosts of a well-nigh limitless universe are on their side in the supernal struggle to attain eternity of life and divinity of status. Such faith-liberated sons have certainly enlisted in the struggles of time on the side of the supreme forces and divine personalities of eternity; even the stars in their courses are now doing battle for them; at last they gaze upon the universe from within, from God’s view point, and all is transformed from the uncertainties of material isolation to the sureties of eternal spiritual progression. Even time itself becomes but the shadow of eternity cast by Paradise realities upon the moving panoply of space.” <a id="s2464_865"></a>[UB 101:10.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p10_8)

## CONCLUSION

> “True it is, you mortals are of earthly, animal origin; your frame is indeed dust. But if you actually will, if you really desire, surely the heritage of the ages is yours, and you shall someday serve throughout the universes in your true characters—children of the Supreme God of experience and divine sons of the Paradise Father of all personalities.” <a id="s2468_356"></a>[UB 112:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_19)
