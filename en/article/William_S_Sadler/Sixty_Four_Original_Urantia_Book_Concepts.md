In this informally published paper, Dr. William Sadler outlines 64 knowledge concepts he describes as original in _The Urantia Book_ based on his own understanding and research. The date of its preparation is not known but it is speculated that it was drafted in the mid-twentieth century. 

1. **The Eternal Son of Paradise:** For the first time in human records the Eternal Son is clearly designated and personally identified. [Papers 6–7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6) 

2. **The Unique Conjoint Actor:** The detailed concept of the Third Person of Deity is both unique and original in the Urantia Papers. [Papers 8–9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8)

3. **The Paradise Trinity:** In _The Urantia Book_ the Paradise Trinity finds its only present day identification and recognition. [Paper 10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10)

4. **The Central Geographic Residence of Deity:** For the first time the world knows exactly where God lives— Paradise. [Papers 11–12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11)

5. **The Absolute Isle of Paradise:** The original concept of Paradise as the absolute of non-deity reality and its location at the geographic center of infinity is discussed in some detail. [Paper 11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11)

6. **Multiple Creator Sons:** Recognition and discussion of the existence of more than 700,000 Creator Paradise Sons is provided for the first time in _The Urantia Book_. [Papers 20–21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20) 

7. **Concept of the Absolutes:** The concept of the Unqualified, Universal, and Deity Absolutes is original with _The Urantia Book_. [Foreword](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0). 

8. **Doctrine of Evolutionary Deity:** While I [Sadler] saw an intimation of finite Deity in one of Pratt’s books about the time of the coming of the Urantia Papers, I am sure that the concepts of the Supreme Being and God the Ultimate are original. [Papers 115–118](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115) 

9. **Concept of the Triunities:** The Triunities and Triodities are original _Urantia Book_ concepts. [Paper 104](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104) 

10. Havona Universe and Natives: The billion world description of the Central Universe of Havona and its inhabitants is a wholly new and original concept presented in _The Urantia Book_. [Papers 12–14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12)

11. **The Concept of Space:** Not withstanding the theory of an “_exploding cosmos,_” the space concept of _The Urantia Book_ is new and original. [Paper 15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15) 

12. **The Grand and Master Universes:** The overall cosmological concept of the Master cosmos is not only original, but it far transcends all previous ideas. [Papers 11–15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11) 

13. **The Seven Orders of Trinity-Created Days/Sons:** While one of these seven orders, the “_Ancient of Days,_” is mentioned in the Bible, the whole presentation is both new and original. [Paper 18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/18) 

14. **The Paradise Sons of God:** The story of Magisterial and Trinity Teacher Sons in addition to Creator Sons is entirely original with _The Urantia Book_. [Paper 20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20) 

15. **Trinitized Sons of God:** The story and technique of the trinitization of divine Sons is unique and original in the Urantia papers. [Paper 22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22) 

16. **The Seven Master Spirits:** While the Bible makes mention of seven Spirits of God, it is only in _The Urantia Book_ that these Spirits are identified and their work fully described. [Paper 16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16) 

17. **The Vast Family of the Conjoint Actor:** The vast and far flung Family of the Infinite Spirit, the God of Mind—supernaphim, seconaphim. Solitary Messengers are but briefly foreshadowed by the Biblical narrative of seraphim and cherubim. [Papers 23–28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23) 

18. **The Universal Circuits:** The gravity, personality, spirit, and mind circuits are original teachings of _The Urantia Book_. [Papers 3, 7 & 9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3)

20. **Power Directors—Force Organizers:** The whole concept of intelligent and purposive control of cosmic energy is original with _The Urantia Book_. [Paper 29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29)

22. **The Ultimaton:** At the time of the suggestion of the uItimaton in the Urantia Papers, I had never heard of such a concept in scientific literature. Recently there has been some scientific speculation as to the possible existence of some a particle analogous to the ultimaton concept. [Papers 41, 42](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41) 

23. **Origin of the Solar System:** While the Urantia narrative of the origin of the solar system includes some features of the Moulton-Chamberlain theory, the whole story is so complete and unique as to make it practically an original presentation. [Paper 57](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57) 

24. **The Architectural Worlds:** The concept of Worlds made to order for specific purposes is original with _The Urantia Book_. [Papers 15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15), [43](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43), [46](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46) 

25. **Universe Administration:** From the inhabited worlds to the management of the grand universe the administrative scheme presented in _The Urantia Book_ is entirely new. [Paper 33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33)

27. **Origin of the Human Race:** While the Urantia story of the origin of the human race validates the doctrine of evolution, it presents such a detailed and unique narrative as to constitute an all but original presentation of human origins. [Papers 62–63](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62) 

28. **Origin of the Colored Races:** The Urantia story of the origin of the Sangik races is the only such narrative in existence. [Paper 64](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64) 

29. **Source and Nature of Personality:** While _The Urantia Book_, like science, fails to define personality, it does illuminate its origin as a direct bestowal from God and gratifyingly portrays its significance to human beings and its magnificent destiny. (Entire Book) 

30. **The Concept of Thought Adjusters:** While the Bible talks about the “_true light which lighteth every man coming into the world,_” the story of Thought Adjusters as revealed in the Urantia Papers is so replete and unique as to constitute a new and original story. [Papers 107–111](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107) 

31. **Evolution of the Soul:** The concept of the origin, nature, and evolution of the soul and human responsibility for its growth is original with _The Urantia Book_. [Paper 110](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110) 

32. **Identification of the Holy Spirit:** Pointing out the Holy Spirit as the presence of the Local Universe Mother Spirit, a daughter of the Infinite Spirit, is altogether new and original in the Urantia Papers. [Paper 34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34) 

33. **The Seven Adjutant Mind Spirits:** While the Bible makes mention of seven spirits and in Isaiah partially identifies them, the Urantia narrative is so full and unique as to make it virtually an original presentation. [Paper 36:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5) 

34. **Local Universe Sons of God:** The whole story of Local Universe Sons is new and original. [Paper 35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35) 

35. **The Ascension Plan to “_Be You Perfect_”:** While Jesus propounded the mandate “_Be you perfect_”, etc., the unfoldment of the Paradise ascension plan in _The Urantia Book_ is an all but new original concept. [Papers 1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1), [7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7), [14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14), [26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26) 

36. **The Seven Mansion Worlds:** While the Master alluded to the “_mansion worlds,_” as noted in the Bible, the replete story of their nature and purpose is both new and original. [Paper 17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/17) 

37. **The Morontia Concept:** The whole morontia concept of the stage between the material and the spiritual is new and original in _The Urantia Book_. [Papers 30:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4); [39:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p2); [48](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48) 

38. **Celestial Artisans and Reversion Directors:** Both of these concepts are new in _The Urantia Book_. The concept of celestial play and spiritual humor is all but new. [Papers 30:3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p3); [48:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4)

40. **The Urantia Midwayers:** While the Old Testament does refer to the “_Nephilim_” the citation is so indefinite as to constitute the Urantia story of the midwayers as a new and original narrative. [Papers 30:9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p9); [66:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4); [77:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p6) 

41. **The Superhuman Planetary Government:** The story of the planetary functions of the Most Highs, the Reserve Corps, and the planetary seraphim is original, notwithstanding the allusion to the work of the Most Highs in the Bible. [Paper 114](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114) 

42. **The Billions of Inhabited Worlds:** At the time of the arrival of the Urantia Papers, there was no literature dealing with inhabited worlds other than our world. The idea was new. In recent years we frequently run across speculations regarding other inhabited planets. _The Urantia Book_’s extensive exposition of the subject is original. [Papers 12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12), [15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15)
