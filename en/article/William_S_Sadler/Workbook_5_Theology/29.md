## I. THE BESTOWALS OF MICHAEL

1. **Proposition**. The bestowals of a Creator Son are not essential to wise and just universe management, but they are necessary to merciful and understanding administration.
	> “These bestowals are not essential to the wise, just, and efficient management of a local universe, but they are absolutely necessary to a fair, merciful, and understanding administration of such a creation, teeming with its varied forms of life and its myriads of intelligent but imperfect creatures.” [UB 119:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_5)

2. **Proposition**. The technique of the bestowals is a universal mystery.
	> “Still, the technique of these successive bestowals remained a mystery. Even Gabriel confesses that he does not comprehend the method whereby this Paradise Son and universe Creator could, at will, assume the personality and live the life of one of his own subordinate creatures.” [UB 119:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p5_5)

3. **Proposition**. It required a billion years to complete the bestowals of Michael; He was born a creator and trained as an administrator, but he was required to earn his sovereignty.
	> “It required almost one billion years of Urantia time to complete the bestowal career of Michael and to effect the final establishment of his supreme authority in the universe of his own creation. Michael was born a creator, educated an administrator, trained an executive, but he was required to earn his sovereignty by experience. And thus has your little world become known throughout all Nebadon as the arena wherein Michael completed the experience which is required of every Paradise Creator Son before he is given unlimited control and direction of the universe of his own making. As you ascend the local universe, you will learn more about the ideals of the personalities concerned in Michael's previous bestowals.” [UB 119:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_2)

4. **Proposition**. To secure Trinity sovereignty, Michael executed the seven bestowals, doing the wills of the diverse Deity associations.
	> “Michael, therefore, had a double purpose in the making of these seven bestowals upon the various orders of his universe creatures: First, he was completing the required experience in creature understanding which is demanded of all Creator Sons before they assume complete sovereignty. At any time a Creator Son may rule his universe in his own right, but he can rule as the supreme representative of the Paradise Trinity only after passing through the seven universe-creature bestowals. Second, he was aspiring to the privilege of representing the maximum authority of the Paradise Trinity which can be exercised in the direct and personal administration of a local universe. Accordingly, did Michael, during the experience of each of his universe bestowals, successfully and acceptably voluntarily subordinate himself to the variously constituted wills of the diverse associations of the persons of the Paradise Trinity.” [UB 120:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_4)

5. **Proposition**. The Urantia bestowal was the last act in the acquirement of universe sovereignty.
	> “Before the events I am about to delineate, Michael of Nebadon had bestowed himself six times after the similitude of six differing orders of his diverse creation of intelligent beings. Then he prepared to descend upon Urantia in the likeness of mortal flesh, the lowest order of his intelligent will creatures, and, as such a human of the material realm, to execute the final act in the drama of the acquirement of universe sovereignty in accordance with the mandates of the divine Paradise Rulers of the universe of universes.” [UB 120:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_2)

6. **Proposition**. Michael's bestowal not only completed his sovereignty, but also augmented the evolving sovereignty of God the Supreme.
	> “In completing his creature bestowals, Michael was not only establishing his own sovereignty but also was augmenting the evolving sovereignty of God the Supreme. In the course of these bestowals the Creator Son not only engaged in a descending exploration of the various natures of creature personality, but he also achieved the revelation of the variously diversified wills of the Paradise Deities, whose synthetic unity, as revealed by the Supreme Creators, is revelatory of the will of the Supreme Being.” [UB 119:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_3)

7. **Proposition**. On the Urantia bestowal, Michael, in addition to revealing the Father, achieved the will of sevenfold Deity culminating in the Supreme.
	> “In this connection it should be borne in mind that Michael had elected to execute this bestowal in the likeness of mortal flesh, subject to the will of the Paradise Father. The Creator Son required instructions from no one in order to effect this incarnation for the sole purpose of achieving universe sovereignty, but he had embarked upon a program of the revelation of the Supreme which involved co-operative functioning with the diverse wills of the Paradise Deities. Thus his sovereignty, when finally and personally acquired, would actually be all-inclusive of the sevenfold will of Deity as it culminates in the Supreme. He had, therefore, six times previously been instructed by the personal representatives of the various Paradise Deities and associations thereof; and now he was instructed by the Union of Days, ambassador of the Paradise Trinity to the local universe of Nebadon, acting on behalf of the Universal Father.” [UB 120:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_7)

8. **Proposition**. Jesus’ mission was to acquire creature experience, reveal the Father, attain sovereignty, and terminate the Lucifer rebellion.
	> “Never lose sight of the fact that the prime mission of Jesus in his seventh bestowal was the acquirement of creature experience, the achievement of the sovereignty of Nebadon. And in the gathering of this very experience he made the supreme revelation of the Paradise Father to Urantia and to his entire local universe. Incidental to these purposes he also undertook to untangle the complicated affairs of this planet as they were related to the Lucifer rebellion.” [UB 128:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p7_6)

9. **Proposition**. Jesus lived his life of incarnation on Urantia, but he lived it for his entire universe.
	> “It will also always be helpful in understanding Jesus' life on earth if all mortal students of this divine bestowal will remember that, while he lived this life of incarnation _on_ Urantia, he lived it _for_ his entire universe. There was something special and inspiring associated with the life he lived in the flesh of mortal nature for every single inhabited sphere throughout all the universe of Nebadon. The same is also true of all those worlds which have become habitable since the eventful times of his sojourn on Urantia. And it will likewise be equally true of all worlds which may become inhabited by will creatures in all the future history of this local universe.” [UB 129:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_6)

## II. JOSEPH AND MARY

1. **Proposition**. Gabriel selected Joseph and Mary to be the parents of Jesus.
	> “When this commission ended its labors, Gabriel was present on Urantia and received the report nominating three prospective unions as being, in the opinion of the commission, equally favorable as bestowal families for Michael’s projected incarnation.
	> 
	> “From the three couples nominated, Gabriel made the personal choice of Joseph and Mary, subsequently making his personal appearance to Mary, at which time he imparted to her the glad tidings that she had been selected to become the earth mother of the bestowal child.” [UB 122:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p0_3)

2. **Proposition**. Joseph's ancestry of mechanics led back to Andon and Fonta.
	> “Joseph, the human father of Jesus (Joshua ben Joseph), was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, albeit he carried many non-Jewish racial strains which had been added to his ancestral tree from time to time by the female lines of his progenitors. The ancestry of the father of Jesus went back to the days of Abraham and through this venerable patriarch to the earlier lines of inheritance leading to the Sumerians and Nodites and, through the southern tribes of the ancient blue man, to Andon and Fonta. David and Solomon were not in the direct line of Joseph's ancestry, neither did Joseph's lineage go directly back to Adam. Joseph's immediate ancestors were mechanics—builders, carpenters, masons, and smiths. Joseph himself was a carpenter and later a contractor. His family belonged to a long and illustrious line of the nobility of the common people, accentuated ever and anon by the appearance of unusual individuals who had distinguished themselves in connection with the evolution of religion on Urantia.” [UB 122:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p1_1)

3. **Proposition**. Mary came of a long line of illustrious ancestors. She was an even tempered extrovert, but hardly a Jewess.
	> “Mary, the earth mother of Jesus, was a descendant of a long line of unique ancestors embracing many of the most remarkable women in the racial history of Urantia. Although Mary was an average woman of her day and generation, possessing a fairly normal temperament, she reckoned among her ancestors such well-known women as Annon, Tamar, Ruth, Bathsheba, Ansie, Cloa, Eve, Enta, and Ratta. No Jewish woman of that day had a more illustrious lineage of common progenitors or one extending back to more auspicious beginnings. Mary's ancestry, like Joseph's, was characterized by the predominance of strong but average individuals, relieved now and then by numerous outstanding personalities in the march of civilization and the progressive evolution of religion. Racially considered, it is hardly proper to regard Mary as a Jewess. In culture and belief she was a Jew, but in hereditary endowment she was more a composite of Syrian, Hittite, Phoenician, Greek, and Egyptian stocks, her racial inheritance being more general than that of Joseph.” [UB 122:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p1_2)

4. **Proposition**. Joseph was a mild-mannered and conscientious introvert - subject to mild mood swings.
	> “Joseph was a mild-mannered man, extremely conscientious, and in every way faithful to the religious conventions and practices of his people. He talked little but thought much. The sorry plight of the Jewish people caused Joseph much sadness. As a youth, among his eight brothers and sisters, he had been more cheerful, but in the earlier years of married life (during Jesus' childhood) he was subject to periods of mild spiritual discouragement. These temperamental manifestations were greatly improved just before his untimely death and after the economic condition of his family had been enhanced by his advancement from the rank of carpenter to the role of a prosperous contractor.” [UB 122:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_1)

5. **Proposition**. Mary had a sunny disposition, never sorrowful until after Joseph's death. She was composed and courageous in dealing with the problems of raising Jesus.
	> “Mary's temperament was quite opposite to that of her husband. She was usually cheerful, was very rarely downcast, and possessed an ever-sunny disposition. Mary indulged in free and frequent expression of her emotional feelings and was never observed to be sorrowful until after the sudden death of Joseph. And she had hardly recovered from this shock when she had thrust upon her the anxieties and questionings aroused by the extraordinary career of her eldest son, which was so rapidly unfolding before her astonished gaze. But throughout all this unusual experience Mary was composed, courageous, and fairly wise in her relationship with her strange and little-understood first-born son and his surviving brothers and sisters.” [UB 122:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_2)

6. **Proposition**. Jesus derived much of his gentleness from his father; much of his ability as a teacher from his mother. Mary's optimistic and determined temperament tended to dominate Jesus' career.
	> “Jesus derived much of his unusual gentleness and marvelous sympathetic understanding of human nature from his father; he inherited his gift as a great teacher and his tremendous capacity for righteous indignation from his mother. In emotional reactions to his adult-life environment, Jesus was at one time like his father, meditative and worshipful, sometimes characterized by apparent sadness; but more often he drove forward in the manner of his mother's optimistic and determined disposition. All in all, Mary's temperament tended to dominate the career of the divine Son as he grew up and swung into the momentous strides of his adult life. In some particulars Jesus was a blending of his parents' traits; in other respects he exhibited the traits of one in contrast with those of the other.” [UB 122:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_3)

7. **Proposition**. From Joseph, Jesus received his ceremonial and scripture training; from Mary, his personal religious freedom.
	> “From Joseph Jesus secured his strict training in the usages of the Jewish ceremonials and his unusual acquaintance with the Hebrew scriptures; from Mary he derived a broader viewpoint of religious life and a more liberal concept of personal spiritual freedom.” [UB 122:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_4)

8. **Proposition**. It was a trying experience for Joseph and Mary to rear Jesus. They never dreamed that he was the Creator incarnate.
	> “It was a trying experience for Joseph and Mary to undertake the rearing of this unprecedented combination of divinity and humanity, and they deserve great credit for so faithfully and successfully discharging their parental responsibilities. Increasingly Jesus' parents realized that there was something superhuman resident within this eldest son, but they never even faintly dreamed that this son of promise was indeed and in truth the actual creator of this local universe of things and beings. Joseph and Mary lived and died without ever learning that their son Jesus really was the Universe Creator incarnate in mortal flesh.” [UB 124:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_4)

### III. BIRTH OF JESUS

1. **Proposition**. Joseph and Mary were married in March 8 B.C. The Roman census was taken in Palestine one year later.
	> “In the month of March, 8 B.C. (the month Joseph and Mary were married), Caesar Augustus decreed that all inhabitants of the Roman Empire should be numbered, that a census should be made which could be used for effecting better taxation. The Jews had always been greatly prejudiced against any attempt to ”number the people," and this, in connection with the serious domestic difficulties of Herod, King of Judea, had conspired to cause the postponement of the taking of this census in the Jewish kingdom for one year. Throughout all the Roman Empire this census was registered in the year 8 B.C., except in the Palestinian kingdom of Herod, where it was taken in 7 B.C., one year later. [UB 122:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_1)

2. **Proposition**. Over Joseph's objections, Mary accompanied him to Bethlehem for tax registry.
	> “It was not necessary that Mary should go to Bethlehem for enrollment—Joseph was authorized to register for his family—but Mary, being an adventurous and aggressive person, insisted on accompanying him. She feared being left alone lest the child be born while Joseph was away, and again, Bethlehem being not far from the City of Judah, Mary foresaw a possible pleasurable visit with her kinswoman Elizabeth.
	> 
	> “Joseph virtually forbade Mary to accompany him, but it was of no avail; when the food was packed for the trip of three or four days, she prepared double rations and made ready for the journey. But before they actually set forth, Joseph was reconciled to Mary's going along, and they cheerfully departed from Nazareth at the break of day.” [UB 122:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_2)

3. **Proposition**. The inn being overcrowded, they were domiciled in the grain storage quarters.
	> “The inn was overcrowded, and Joseph accordingly sought lodgings with distant relatives, but every room in Bethlehem was filled to overflowing. On returning to the courtyard of the inn, he was informed that the caravan stables, hewn out of the side of the rock and situated just below the inn, had been cleared of animals and cleaned up for the reception of lodgers. Leaving the donkey in the courtyard, Joseph shouldered their bags of clothing and provisions and with Mary descended the stone steps to their lodgings below. They found themselves located in what had been a grain storage room to the front of the stalls and mangers. Tent curtains had been hung, and they counted themselves fortunate to have such comfortable quarters.
	> 
	> “Joseph had thought to go out at once and enroll, but Mary was weary; she was considerably distressed and besought him to remain by her side, which he did.” [UB 122:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_7)

4. **Proposition**. Jesus was born at noon, August 2l, 7 B.C, and placed in a near-by manger.
	> “All that night Mary was restless so that neither of them slept much. By the break of day the pangs of childbirth were well in evidence, and at noon, August 21, 7 B.C., with the help and kind ministrations of women fellow travelers, Mary was delivered of a male child. Jesus of Nazareth was born into the world, was wrapped in the clothes which Mary had brought along for such a possible contingency, and laid in a near-by manger.” [UB 122:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_1)

5. **Proposition**. Jesus was born just as all babies before that day and since have come into the world.
	> “In just the same manner as all babies before that day and since have come into the world, the promised child was born; and on the eighth day, according to the Jewish practice, he was circumcised and formally named Joshua (Jesus).” [UB 122:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_2)

6. **Proposition**. The seraphim did sing anthems, but this praise was not heard by human ears.
	> “At the noontide birth of Jesus the seraphim of Urantia, assembled under their directors, did sing anthems of glory over the Bethlehem manger, but these utterances of praise were not heard by human ears. No shepherds nor any other mortal creatures came to pay homage to the babe of Bethlehem until the day of the arrival of certain priests from Ur, who were sent down from Jerusalem by Zacharias” [UB 122:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_5)

7. **Proposition**. When Jesus was three weeks old, the Mesopotamian priests, directed by Zacharias, visited him and left gifts.
	> “These priests from Mesopotamia had been told sometime before by a strange religious teacher of their country that he had had a dream in which he was informed that ”the light of life“ was about to appear on earth as a babe and among the Jews. And thither went these three teachers looking for this ”light of life.“ After many weeks of futile search in Jerusalem, they were about to return to Ur when Zacharias met them and disclosed his belief that Jesus was the object of their quest and sent them on to Bethlehem, where they found the babe and left their gifts with Mary, his earth mother. The babe was almost three weeks old at the time of their visit.” [UB 122:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_6)

8. **Proposition**. The wise men saw no star. That myth was subsequently based on natural astronomical occurrences.
	> “These wise men saw no star to guide them to Bethlehem. The beautiful legend of the star of Bethlehem originated in this way: Jesus was born August 21 at noon, 7 B.C. On May 29, 7 B.C., there occurred an extraordinary conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the constellation of Pisces. And it is a remarkable astronomic fact that similar conjunctions occurred on September 29 and December 5 of the same year. Upon the basis of these extraordinary but wholly natural events the well-meaning Zealots of the succeeding generation constructed the appealing legend of the star of Bethlehem and the adoring Magi led thereby to the manger, where they beheld and worshiped the newborn babe. Oriental and near-Oriental minds delight in fairy stories, and they are continually spinning such beautiful myths about the lives of their religious leaders and political heroes. In the absence of printing, when most human knowledge was passed by word of mouth from one generation to another, it was very easy for myths to become traditions and for traditions eventually to become accepted as facts.” [UB 122:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_7)

9. **Proposition**. Jesus was conceived and born just as other babies, except that this baby was the incarnation of Michael - the mystery of the universes.
	> “Joshua ben Joseph, the Jewish baby, was conceived and was born into the world just as all other babies before and since _except_ that this particular baby was the incarnation of Michael of Nebadon, a divine Son of Paradise and the creator of all this local universe of things and beings. And this mystery of the incarnation of Deity within the human form of Jesus, otherwise of natural origin on the world, will forever remain unsolved. Even in eternity you will never know the technique and method of the incarnation of the Creator in the form and likeness of his creatures. That is the secret of Sonarington, and such mysteries are the exclusive possession of those divine Sons who have passed through the bestowal experience.” [UB 119:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p7_5)

## IV. THE INCARNATION

1. **Proposition**. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
	> “Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle—the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.” [UB 120:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p4_5)

2. **Proposition**. The purpose of creature incarnation is to make Creator Sons sympathetic and merciful rulers.
	> “The purpose of these creature incarnations is to enable such Creators to become wise, sympathetic, just, and understanding sovereigns. These divine Sons are innately just, but they become understandingly merciful as a result of these successive bestowal experiences; they are naturally merciful, but these experiences make them merciful in new and additional ways. These bestowals are the last steps in their education and training for the sublime tasks of ruling the local universes in divine righteousness and by just judgment.” [UB 119:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_4)

## V. HEROD'S MASSACRE

1. **Proposition**. In October 6 B.C., Herod ordered the massacre of sixteen boy babies. The Nazareth family had already departed for Alexandria.
	> “When, after more than a year of searching, Herod's spies had not located Jesus, and because of the suspicion that the babe was still concealed in Bethlehem, he prepared an order directing that a systematic search be made of every house in Bethlehem, and that all boy babies under two years of age should be killed. In this manner Herod hoped to make sure that this child who was to become ‘king of the Jews’ would be destroyed. And thus perished in one day sixteen boy babies in Bethlehem of Judea. But intrigue and murder, even in his own immediate family, were common occurrences at the court of Herod.
	> 
	> “The massacre of these infants took place about the middle of October, 6 B.C., when Jesus was a little over one year of age. But there were believers in the coming Messiah even among Herod's court attachés and one of these, learning of the order to slaughter the Bethlehem boy babies, communicated with Zacharias, who in turn dispatched a messenger to Joseph; and the night before the massacre Joseph and Mary departed from Bethlehem with the babe for Alexandria in Egypt. In order to avoid attracting attention, they journeyed alone to Egypt with Jesus. They went to Alexandria on funds provided by Zacharias, and there Joseph worked at his trade while Mary and Jesus lodged with well-to-do relatives of Joseph's family. They sojourned in Alexandria two full years, not returning to Bethlehem until after the death of Herod.” [UB 122:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p10_3)

## VI. AT ALEXANDRIA

1. **Proposition**. After two years in Alexandria, their friends presented Jesus with a copy of the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures.
	> “Throughout the two years of their sojourn at Alexandria, Jesus enjoyed good health and continued to grow normally. Aside from a few friends and relatives no one was told about Jesus' being a ”child of promise.“ One of Joseph's relatives revealed this to a few friends in Memphis, descendants of the distant Ikhnaton, and they, with a small group of Alexandrian believers, assembled at the palatial home of Joseph's relative-benefactor a short time before the return to Palestine to wish the Nazareth family well and to pay their respects to the child. On this occasion the assembled friends presented Jesus with a complete copy of the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures. But this copy of the Jewish sacred writings was not placed in Joseph's hands until both he and Mary had finally declined the invitation of their Memphis and Alexandrian friends to remain in Egypt.” [UB 123:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_3)

2. **Proposition**. The family left Alexandria in August A B.C., spending September in Bethlehem.
	> “Joseph and Mary finally took leave of Alexandria on a boat belonging to their friend Ezraeon, bound for Joppa, arriving at that port late in August of the year 4 B.C. They went directly to Bethlehem, where they spent the entire month of September in counsel with their friends and relatives concerning whether they should remain there or return to Nazareth.” [UB 123:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_4)

## VII. THE NAZARETH HOME

1. **Proposition**. Jesus' Nazareth home was very advantageously located.
	> “The home of Jesus was not far from the high hill in the northerly part of Nazareth, some distance from the village spring, which was in the eastern section of the town. Jesus' family dwelt in the outskirts of the city, and this made it all the easier for him subsequently to enjoy frequent strolls in the country and to make trips up to the top of this near-by highland, the highest of all the hills of southern Galilee save the Mount Tabor range to the east and the hill of Nain, which was about the same height. Their home was located a little to the south and east of the southern promontory of this hill and about midway between the base of this elevation and the road leading out of Nazareth toward Cana. Aside from climbing the hill, Jesus' favorite stroll was to follow a narrow trail winding about the base of the hill in a northeasterly direction to a point where it joined the road to Sepphoris.” [UB 122:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6_1)

2. **Proposition**. Jesus was a little over three years old when they returned to Nazareth, and he enjoyed having his own premises.
	> “Jesus was about three years and two months old at the time of their return to Nazareth. He had stood all these travels very well and was in excellent health and full of childish glee and excitement at having premises of his own to run about in and to enjoy. But he greatly missed the association of his Alexandrian playmates.” [UB 123:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_2)

3. **Proposition**. During the fourth year of normal development, Jesus formed a close attachment for Jacob, the neighbor boy.
	> “Jesus' entire fourth year was a period of normal physical development and of unusual mental activity. Meantime he had formed a very close attachment for a neighbor boy about his own age named Jacob. Jesus and Jacob were always happy in their play, and they grew up to be great friends and loyal companions. ” [UB 123:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_4)

4. **Proposition**. On February 11, 2 B.C., Jesus' Thought Adjuster came - the one which had indwelt Machiventa Melchizedek.
	> “In something more than a year after the return to Nazareth the boy Jesus arrived at the age of his first personal and wholehearted moral decision; and there came to abide with him a Thought Adjuster, a divine gift of the Paradise Father, which had aforetime served with Machiventa Melchizedek, thus gaining the experience of functioning in connection with the incarnation of a supermortal being living in the likeness of mortal flesh. This event occurred on February 11, 2 B.C. Jesus was no more aware of the coming of the divine Monitor than are the millions upon millions of other children who, before and since that day, have likewise received these Thought Adjusters to indwell their minds and work for the ultimate spiritualization of these minds and the eternal survival of their evolving immortal souls.” [UB 123:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_1)

5. **Proposition**. John the Baptist visited Jesus in the summer of 1 B.C. They enjoyed themselves while their parents discussed plans for their future.
	> “Before Jesus was six years of age, in the early summer of 1 B.C., Zacharias and Elizabeth and their son John came to visit the Nazareth family. Jesus and John had a happy time during this, their first visit within their memories. Although the visitors could remain only a few days, the parents talked over many things, including the future plans for their sons. While they were thus engaged, the lads played with blocks in the sand on top of the house and in many other ways enjoyed themselves in true boyish fashion.” [UB 123:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_4)

6. **Proposition**. By eight years of age, Jesus was well-known to the village potter and many others. He was competent with many family chores.
	> “Before he was eight years of age, he was known to all the mothers and young women of Nazareth, who had met him and talked with him at the spring, which was not far from his home, and which was one of the social centers of contact and gossip for the entire town. This year Jesus learned to milk the family cow and care for the other animals. During this and the following year he also learned to make cheese and to weave. When he was ten years of age, he was an expert loom operator. It was about this time that Jesus and the neighbor boy Jacob became great friends of the potter who worked near the flowing spring; and as they watched Nathan's deft fingers mold the clay on the potter's wheel, many times both of them determined to be potters when they grew up. Nathan was very fond of the lads and often gave them clay to play with, seeking to stimulate their creative imaginations by suggesting competitive efforts in modeling various objects and animals.” [UB 123:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_15)

## VIII. EDUCATION OF JESUS

1. **Proposition.** From five years of age until ten, Jesus was one continuous question mark.
	> “From the time Jesus was five years old until he was ten, he was one continuous question mark. While Joseph and Mary could not always answer his questions, they never failed fully to discuss his inquiries and in every other possible way to assist him in his efforts to reach a satisfactory solution of the problem which his alert mind had suggested. ” [UB 123:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_3)

2. **Proposition**. At seven Jesus entered school. He was a fluent reader, writer, and speaker of two languages.
	> “Jesus was now seven years old, the age when Jewish children were supposed to begin their formal education in the synagogue schools. Accordingly, in August of this year he entered upon his eventful school life at Nazareth Already this lad was a fluent reader, writer, and speaker of two languages, Aramaic and Greek. He was now to acquaint himself with the task of learning to read, write, and speak the Hebrew language. And he was truly eager for the new school life which was ahead of him.” [UB 123:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_1)

3. **Proposition**. Jesus got his moral training and spiritual culture at home; his practical education by mingling with his fellow men.
	> “Jesus received his moral training and spiritual culture chiefly in his own home. He secured much of his intellectual and theological education from the chazan. But his real education—that equipment of mind and heart for the actual test of grappling with the difficult problems of life—he obtained by mingling with his fellow men. It was this close association with his fellow men, young and old, Jew and gentile, that afforded him the opportunity to know the human race. Jesus was highly educated in that he thoroughly understood men and devotedly loved them.” [UB 123:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_8)

4. **Proposition**. Jesus studied the Hebrew scriptures by the repeating-aloud method, graduating when he was thirteen.
	> “For three years—until he was ten—he attended the elementary school of the Nazareth synagogue. For these three years he studied the rudiments of the Book of the Law as it was recorded in the Hebrew tongue. For the following three years he studied in the advanced school and committed to memory, by the method of repeating aloud, the deeper teachings of the sacred law. He graduated from this school of the synagogue during his thirteenth year and was turned over to his parents by the synagogue rulers as an educated ”son of the commandment“—henceforth a responsible citizen of the commonwealth of Israel, all of which entailed his attendance at the Passovers in Jerusalem; accordingly, he attended his first Passover that year in company with his father and mother.” [UB 123:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_2)

5. **Proposition**. Jesus belonged to the upper third of his class, and therefore was excused from attendance one week each month.
	> “This was an interesting year at school. Although Jesus was not an unusual student, he was a diligent pupil and belonged to the more progressive third of the class, doing his work so well that he was excused from attendance one week out of each month. This week he usually spent either with his fisherman uncle on the shores of the Sea of Galilee near Magdala or on the farm of another uncle (his mother's brother) five miles south of Nazareth.” [UB 123:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_1)

6. **Proposition.** Jesus made trouble at school and kept Nazareth in a hubbub by the many questions he asked.
	> “He entered the advanced school of the synagogue in August. At school he was constantly creating trouble by the questions he persisted in asking. Increasingly he kept all Nazareth in more or less of a hubbub. His parents were loath to forbid his asking these disquieting questions, and his chief teacher was greatly intrigued by the lad's curiosity, insight, and hunger for knowledge.
	> 
	> “Jesus' playmates saw nothing supernatural in his conduct; in most ways he was altogether like themselves. His interest in study was somewhat above the average but not wholly unusual. He did ask more questions at school than others in his class. ”" [UB 124:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_2)

7. **Proposition.** Jesus broadened his education by contact with numerous caravan travelers and conductors.
	> “Next, in addition to his more formal schooling, Jesus began to make contact with human nature from the four quarters of the earth as men from many lands passed in and out of his father's repair shop. When he grew older, he mingled freely with the caravans as they tarried near the spring for rest and nourishment. Being a fluent speaker of Greek, he had little trouble in conversing with the majority of the caravan travelers and conductors.” [UB 123:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_6)

8. **Proposition.** Jesus made serious trouble for his parents by drawing a picture of the teacher on the schoolroom floor.
	> “But trouble was again stirred up at school when one of the more backward pupils discovered Jesus drawing a charcoal picture of the teacher on the floor of the schoolroom. There it was, plain as day, and many of the elders had viewed it before the committee went to call on Joseph to demand that something be done to suppress the lawlessness of his eldest son. And though this was not the first time complaints had come to Joseph and Mary about the doings of their versatile and aggressive child, this was the most serious of all the accusations which had thus far been lodged against him. Jesus listened to the indictment of his artistic efforts for some time, being seated on a large stone just outside the back door. He resented their blaming his father for his alleged misdeeds; so in he marched, fearlessly confronting his accusers. The elders were thrown into confusion. Some were inclined to view the episode humorously, while one or two seemed to think one or two seemed to think the boy was sacrilegious if not blasphemous. Joseph was nonplused, Mary indignant, but Jesus insisted on being heard. He had his say, courageously defended his viewpoint, and with consummate self-control announced that he would abide by the decision of his father in this as in all other matters controversial. And the committee of elders departed in silence.” [UB 124:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_4)

9. **Proposition.** Mary tried to influence Joseph to permit Jesus to model clay at home, but he refused, since it would be in violation of the second commandment.
	> “Mary endeavored to influence Joseph to permit Jesus to model in clay at home, provided he promised not to carry on any of these questionable activities at school, but Joseph felt impelled to rule that the rabbinical interpretation of the second commandment should prevail. And so Jesus no more drew or modeled the likeness of anything from that day as long as he lived in his father's house. But he was unconvinced of the wrong of what he had done, and to give up such a favorite pastime constituted one of the great trials of his young life.” [UB 124:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_5)

10. **Proposition.** Jesus remonstrated with his father about touching the doorpost parchment. Joseph removed it.
	> “During his last year at school, when he was twelve years old, Jesus remonstrated with his father about the Jewish custom of touching the bit of parchment nailed upon the doorpost each time on going into, or coming out of, the house and then kissing the finger that touched the parchment. As a part of this ritual it was customary to say, ”The Lord shall preserve our going out and our coming in, from this time forth and even forevermore.“ Joseph and Mary had repeatedly instructed Jesus as to the reasons for not making images or drawing pictures, explaining that such creations might be used for idolatrous purposes. Though Jesus failed fully to grasp their proscriptions against images and pictures, he possessed a high concept of consistency and therefore pointed out to his father the essentially idolatrous nature of this habitual obeisance to the doorpost parchment. And Joseph removed the parchment after Jesus had thus remonstrated with him.” [UB 124:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_7)

11. **Proposition.** Jesus graduated March 20, A.D. 7. He thus became a ”son of the commandment."
	> “On the first day of the week, March 20, A.D. 7, Jesus graduated from the course of training in the local school connected with the Nazareth synagogue. This was a great day in the life of any ambitious Jewish family, the day when the first-born son was pronounced a ‘son of the commandment’ and the ransomed first-born of the Lord God of Israel, a ‘child of the Most High’ and servant of the Lord of all the earth.” [UB 124:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p5_4)

## IX. PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP

1. **Proposition.** At the age of six, Jesus was disconcertingly disillusioned when he discovered that his supposedly all-wise father did not know the cause of an earthquake.
	> “The first great shock of Jesus' young life occurred when he was not quite six years old. It had seemed to the lad that his father—at least his father and mother together—knew everything. Imagine, therefore, the surprise of this inquiring child, when he asked his father the cause of a mild earthquake which had just occurred, to hear Joseph say, ”My son, I really do not know.“ Thus began that long and disconcerting disillusionment in the course of which Jesus found out that his earthly parents were not all-wise and all-knowing.” [UB 123:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_2)

2. **Proposition.** On a visit to Scythopolis Jesus was enthused by the Greek games, and was sternly rebuked by his father.
	> “It so happened that just at this time the annual competitive games and public demonstrations of physical prowess between the Greek cities of the Decapolis were in progress at the Scythopolis amphitheater, and Jesus was insistent that his father take him to see the games, and he was so insistent that Joseph hesitated to deny him. The boy was thrilled with the games and entered most heartily into the spirit of the demonstrations of physical development and athletic skill. Joseph was inexpressibly shocked to observe his son's enthusiasm as he beheld these exhibitions of ”heathen“ vaingloriousness. After the games were finished, Joseph received the surprise of his life when he heard Jesus express his approval of them and suggest that it would be good for the young men of Nazareth if they could be thus benefited by wholesome outdoor physical activities. Joseph talked earnestly and long with Jesus concerning the evil nature of such practices, but he well knew that the lad was unconvinced.” [UB 124:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_7)

3. **Proposition**. The only time Jesus ever saw his father angry with him was in connection with their discussion of the Greek games at Scythopolis.
	> “The only time Jesus ever saw his father angry with him was that night in their room at the inn when, in the course of their discussions, the boy so far forgot the trends of Jewish thought as to suggest that they go back home and work for the building of an amphitheater at Nazareth When Joseph heard his first-born son express such un-Jewish sentiments, he forgot his usual calm demeanor and, seizing Jesus by the shoulder, angrily exclaimed, ‘My son, never again let me hear you give utterance to such an evil thought as long as you live.’ Jesus was startled by his father's display of emotion; he had never before been made to feel the personal sting of his father's indignation and was astonished and shocked beyond expression. He only replied, ‘Very well, my father, it shall be so.’ And never again did the boy even in the slightest manner allude to the games and other athletic activities of the Greeks as long as his father lived.” [UB 124:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_8)

4. **Proposition**. Never could Jesus escape from the conflict between his personal convictions and the demands of loyalty to the family usages.
	> “Throughout this and the two following years Jesus suffered great mental distress as the result of his constant effort to adjust his personal views of religious practices and social amenities to the established beliefs of his parents. He was distraught by the conflict between the urge to be loyal to his own convictions and the conscientious admonition of dutiful submission to his parents; his supreme conflict was between two great commands which were uppermost in his youthful mind. The one was: ‘Be loyal to the dictates of your highest convictions of truth and righteousness.’ The other was: ‘Honor your father and mother, for they have given you life and the nurture thereof.’ However, he never shirked the responsibility of making the necessary daily adjustments between these realms of loyalty to one's personal convictions and duty toward one's family, and he achieved the satisfaction of effecting an increasingly harmonious blending of personal convictions and family obligations into a masterful concept of group solidarity based upon loyalty, fairness, tolerance, and love.” [UB 124:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_9)

5. **Proposition.** The temple at Jerusalem impressed Jesus, but he asked his father embarrassing questions about the reason for slaughtering so many animals.
	> “Jesus was profoundly impressed by the temple and all the associated services and other activities. For the first time since he was four years old, he was too much preoccupied with his own meditations to ask many questions. He did, however, ask his father several embarrassing questions (as he had on previous occasions) as to why the heavenly Father required the slaughter of so many innocent and helpless animals. And his father well knew from the expression on the lad's face that his answers and attempts at explanation were unsatisfactory to his deep-thinking and keen-reasoning son.” [UB 124:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_14)

6. **Proposition**. Even when Jesus could not consent, he did his best to conform. He was an artist in adjusting his dedication to duty to his obligations of family loyalty.
	> “Though Jesus, in his mind, would many times refuse to consent to the well-intentioned but misguided efforts of his parents to dictate the course of his thinking or to establish the plan of his work on earth. still, in every manner consistent with his dedication to the doing of his Paradise Father's will, he did most gracefully conform to the desires of his earthly father and to the usages of his family in the flesh. Even when he could not consent, he would do everything possible to conform. He was an artist in the matter of adjusting his dedication to duty to his obligations of family loyalty and social service.” [UB 125:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_12)

7. **Proposition.** At Joseph’s death, Jesus accepted the responsibilities so suddenly thrust upon him. Anyway he would not have to go to Jerusalem to study.
	> “Jesus cheerfully accepted the responsibilities so suddenly thrust upon him, and he carried them faithfully to the end. At least one great problem and anticipated difficulty in his life had been tragically solved — he would not now be expected to go to Jerusalem to study under the rabbis. It remained always true that Jesus ”sat at no man’s feet.” He was ever willing to learn from even the humblest of little children, but he never derived authority to teach truth from human sources.” [UB 126:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_3)

8. Proposition.** Jesus employed the positive method of child-culture. He refused to place emphasis on the forbidden.
	> “By the beginning of this year Jesus had fully won his mother to the acceptance of his methods of child training — the positive injunction to do good in the place of the older Jewish method of forbidding to do evil. In his home and throughout his public-teaching career Jesus invariably employed the _positive_ form of exhortation. Always and everywhere did he say, ”You shall do this — you ought to do that.” Never did he employ the negative mode of teaching derived from the ancient taboos. He refrained from placing emphasis on evil by forbidding it, while he exalted the good by commanding its performance. Prayer time in this household was the occasion for discussing anything and everything relating to the welfare of the family. [UB 127:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_2)

## X. EARLY CHILDHOOD

1. **Proposition.** Joseph and Mary had trouble with Jesus about his prayers - he wanted just to have a little talk with God.
	> “During this year Joseph and Mary had trouble with Jesus about his prayers. He insisted on talking to his heavenly Father much as he would talk to Joseph, his earthly father. This departure from the more solemn and reverent modes of communication with Deity was a bit disconcerting to his parents, especially to his mother, but there was no persuading him to change; he would say his prayers just as he had been taught, after which he insisted on having ‘just a little talk with my Father in heaven.’” [UB 123:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_3)

2. **Proposition.** Jesus was subject to ordinary accidents.
	> “The only real accident Jesus had up to this time was a fall down the back-yard stone stairs which led up to the canvas-roofed bedroom. It happened during an unexpected July sandstorm from the east. The hot winds, carrying blasts of fine sand, usually blew during the rainy season, especially in March and April. It was extraordinary to have such a storm in July. When the storm came up, Jesus was on the housetop playing, as was his habit, for during much of the dry season this was his accustomed playroom. He was blinded by the sand when descending the stairs and fell. After this accident Joseph built a balustrade up both sides of the stairway.” [UB 123:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_5)

3. **Proposition.** Jesus had minor physical ailments, just like common folks.
	> “Though it could hardly be said that Jesus was ever seriously ill, he did have some of the minor ailments of childhood this year, along with his brothers and baby sister.
	> 
	> “School went on and he was still a favored pupil, having one week each month at liberty, and he continued to divide his time about equally between trips to neighboring cities with his father, sojourns on his uncle’s farm south of Nazareth, and fishing excursions out from Magdala.” [UB 124:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_1)

4. **Proposition.** Jesus refused to believe that his human father was kinder than his heavenly Father.
	> “Though many of the temple rituals very touchingly impressed his sense of the beautiful and the symbolic, he was always disappointed by the explanation of the real meanings of these ceremonies which his parents would offer in answer to his many searching inquiries. Jesus simply would not accept explanations of worship and religious devotion which involved belief in the wrath of God or the anger of the Almighty. In further discussion of these questions, after the conclusion of the temple visit, when his father became mildly insistent that he acknowledge acceptance of the orthodox Jewish beliefs, Jesus turned suddenly upon his parents and, looking appealingly into the eyes of his father, said: ‘My father, it cannot be true — the Father in heaven cannot so regard his erring children on earth. The heavenly Father cannot love his children less than you love me. And I well know, no matter what unwise thing I might do, you would never pour out wrath upon me nor vent anger against me. If you, my earthly father, possess such human reflections of the Divine, how much more must the heavenly Father be filled with goodness and overflowing with mercy. I refuse to believe that my Father in heaven loves me less than my father on earth.’” [UB 125:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_6)

## XI. GROWTH OF DIVINITY CONSCIOUSNESS

1. **Proposition.** When ten years old, Jesus first talked with his parents about his personality and the nature of his mission.
	> “It was the fifth of July, the first Sabbath of the month, when Jesus, while strolling through the countryside with his father, first gave expression to feelings and ideas which indicated that he was becoming self-conscious of the unusual nature of his life mission. Joseph listened attentively to the momentous words of his son but made few comments; he volunteered no information. The next day Jesus had a similar but longer talk with his mother. Mary likewise listened to the pronouncements of the lad, but neither did she volunteer any information. It was almost two years before Jesus again spoke to his parents concerning this increasing revelation within his own consciousness regarding the nature of his personality and the character of his mission on earth.” [UB 124:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_1)

2. **Proposition.** He was troubled by doubts, and was slow in recognition of his dual nature.
	> “Throughout this year he experienced many seasons of uncertainty, if not actual doubt, regarding the nature of his mission. His naturally developing human mind did not yet fully grasp the reality of his dual nature. The fact that he had a single personality rendered it difficult for his consciousness to recognize the double origin of those factors which composed the nature associated with that selfsame personality.” [UB 124:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_2)

3. **Proposition.** In his thirteenth year, he became assured of his mission on earth.
	> “It was about the middle of February that Jesus became humanly assured that he was destined to perform a mission on earth for the enlightenment of man and the revelation of God. Momentous decisions, coupled with far-reaching plans, were formulating in the mind of this youth, who was, to outward appearances, an average Jewish lad of Nazareth. The intelligent life of all Nebadon looked on with fascination and amazement as all this began to unfold in the thinking and acting of the now adolescent carpenter’s son.” [UB 124:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p5_3)

4. **Proposition**. In Jerusalem, when thirteen, a messenger appeared, saying: “It is time that you began to be about your Father's business.”
	> “On the day before the Passover Sabbath, flood tides of spiritual illumination swept through the mortal mind of Jesus and filled his human heart to overflowing with affectionate pity for the spiritually blind and morally ignorant multitudes assembled for the celebration of the ancient Passover commemoration. This was one of the most extraordinary days that the Son of God spent in the flesh; and during the night, for the first time in his earth career, there appeared to him an assigned messenger from Salvington, commissioned by Immanuel, who said: ‘The hour has come. It is time that you began to be about your Father’s business.’” [UB 124:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_15)

5. **Proposition.** Being self-conscious of divinity and destiny, the adolescent Jesus found the fourteenth and fifteenth years his great test.
	> “Jesus’ earth-life experiences, the fourteenth and fifteenth years were the most crucial. These two years, after he began to be self-conscious of divinity and destiny, and before he achieved a large measure of communication with his indwelling Adjuster, were the most trying of his eventful life on Urantia. It is this period of two years which should be called the great test, the real temptation. No human youth, in passing through the early confusions and adjustment problems of adolescence, ever experienced a more crucial testing than that which Jesus passed through during his transition from childhood to young manhood.” [UB 126:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p0_1)

6. **Proposition**. During many solitary seasons in the hills, Jesus was in conference with directors of universe affairs.
	> “It has not been revealed for the purposes of this record, but we have been led to infer that the Master, during many of these solitary seasons in the hills, was in direct and executive association with many of his chief directors of universe affairs. Ever since about the time of his baptism this incarnated Sovereign of our universe had become increasingly and consciously active in the direction of certain phases of universe administration. And we have always held the opinion that, in some way not revealed to his immediate associates, during these weeks of decreased participation in the affairs of earth he was engaged in the direction of those high spirit intelligences who were charged with the running of a vast universe, and that the human Jesus chose to designate such activities on his part as being ‘about his Father's business.’” [UB 148:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p3_4)

7. **Proposition.** The attainment of totality of divinity, while fully conscious of the reality of humanity, was marked by seven events.
	> “Just as men must progress from the consciousness of the human to the realization of the divine, so did Jesus ascend from the nature of man to the consciousness of the nature of God. And the Master made this great ascent from the human to the divine by the conjoint achievement of the faith of his mortal intellect and the acts of his indwelling Adjuster. The fact-realization of the attainment of totality of divinity (all the while fully conscious of the reality of humanity) was attended by seven stages of faith consciousness of progressive divinization. These stages of progressive self-realization were marked off by the following extraordinary events in the Master's bestowal experience:
	> 
	> 1. The arrival of the Thought Adjuster.
	> 2. The messenger of Immanuel who appeared to him at Jerusalem when he was about twelve years old.
	> 3. The manifestations attendant upon his baptism.
	> 4. The experiences on the Mount of Transfiguration.
	> 5. The morontia resurrection.
	> 6. The spirit ascension.
	> 7. The final embrace of the Paradise Father, conferring unlimited sovereignty of his universe.” [UB 196:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_6)

## THE BIBLE: JESUS' PRAYER LIFE

> “In these days he went out in the hills to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God.”In these days he went out in the hills to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God.” [Luke 6:12](/en/Bible/Luke/6#v12)
> 
> “And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.” ”And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.” [Mark 1:35](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v35)
> 
> “And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.” [Matt 14:23](/en/Bible/Matthew/14#v23)
> 
> “And Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, ‘Sit here, while I go yonder and pray.’” [Matt 26:36](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v36)
> 
> “And being in agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.” [Luke 22:44](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v44)
> 
> “In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears.” [Heb 5:7](/en/Bible/Hebrews/5#v7)


## XII. GOD AND MAN

1. **Proposition.** Jesus lived under evolutionary and revealed religion, and later became master of Supremacy.
	> “Christ Michael, when bestowed on Urantia, lived under the reign of evolutionary religion up to the time of his baptism. From that moment up to and including the event of his crucifixion he carried forward his work by the combined guidance of evolutionary and revealed religion. From the morning of his resurrection until his ascension he traversed the manifold phases of the morontia life of mortal transition from the world of matter to that of spirit. After his ascension Michael became master of the experience of Supremacy, the realization of the Supreme; and being the one person in Nebadon possessed of unlimited capacity to experience the reality of the Supreme, he forthwith attained to the status of the sovereignty of supremacy in and to his local universe.” [UB 101:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_5)

2. **Proposition**. Jesus was God and man - but he was not a double personality.
	> “But make no mistake; Christ Michael, while truly a dual-origin being, was not a double personality. He was not God in association _with_ man but, rather, God _incarnate_ in man. And he was always just that combined being. The only progressive factor in such a nonunderstandable relationship was the progressive self-conscious realization and recognition (by the human mind) of this fact of being God and man.
	> 
	> “Christ Michael did not progressively become God. God did not, at some vital moment in the earth life of Jesus, become man. Jesus was God _and_ man — always and even forevermore. And this God and this man were, and now are, one, even as the Paradise Trinity of three beings is in reality one Deity.” [UB 120:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p4_2)

3. **Proposition.** He wove his human and divine natures into an effective human individuality.
	> “This year he began anew the task of further weaving his mortal and divine natures into a simple and effective _human individuality_. And he continued to grow in moral status and spiritual understanding.” [UB 127:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_9)

4. **Proposition**. Of his human nature he was never in doubt. Of his divine nature - there was room for doubt from the time of the Jerusalem visitation to his baptism.
	> “Of his human nature he was never in doubt; it was self-evident and always present in his consciousness. But of his divine nature there was always room for doubt and conjecture, at least this was true right up to the event of his baptism. The self-realization of divinity was a slow and, from the human standpoint, a natural evolutionary revelation. This revelation and self-realization of divinity began in Jerusalem when he was not quite thirteen years old with the first supernatural occurrence of his human existence; and this experience of effecting the self-realization of his divine nature was completed at the time of his second supernatural experience while in the flesh, the episode attendant upon his baptism by John in the Jordan, which event marked the beginning of his public career of ministry and teaching.” [UB 128:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_8)

5. **Proposition.** He began life as God appearing as man, and finished as man appearing as God.
	> “This was one of the more unusual years in the inner experience of the Son of Man; great progress was made in effecting working harmony between his human mind and the indwelling Adjuster. The Adjuster had been actively engaged in reorganizing the thinking and in rehearsing the mind for the great events which were in the not then distant future. The personality of Jesus was preparing for his great change in attitude toward the world. These were the in-between times, the transition stage of that being who began life as God appearing as man, and who was now making ready to complete his earth career as man appearing as God.” [UB 134:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_7)

6. **Proposition.** Jesus was able to self-limit his divine consciousness and conceal his preknowledge.
	> “We are utterly at a loss to differentiate between his practice of self-limiting his divine consciousness and his technique of concealing his preknowledge and thought discernment from his human associates. We are convinced that he used both of these techniques, but we are not always able, in a given instance, to specify which method he may have employed. We frequently observed him acting with only the human content of consciousness; then would we behold him in conference with the directors of the celestial hosts of the universe and discern the undoubted functioning of the divine mind. And then on almost numberless occasions did we witness the working of this combined personality of man and God as it was activated by the apparent perfect union of the human and the divine minds. This is the limit of our knowledge of such phenomena; we really do not actually know the full truth about this mystery..” [UB 161:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p3_3)

7. **Proposition.** Such a transcendental bestowal of man-saving and God-revealing should restrain theologians from making creedal bondage out of his teachings.
	> “The beauty and sublimity, the humanity and divinity, the simplicity and uniqueness, of Jesus' life on earth present such a striking and appealing picture of man-saving and God-revealing that the theologians and philosophers of all time should be effectively restrained from daring to form creeds or create theological systems of spiritual bondage out of such a transcendental bestowal of God in the form of man. In Jesus the universe produced a mortal man in whom the spirit of love triumphed over the material handicaps of time and overcame the fact of physical origin.” [UB 195:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_2)

## THE BIBLE: JESUS' SUBORDINATION TO THE FATHER

> “If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.” [John 14:28](/en/Bible/John/14#v28)
	> 
> “And he who sent me is with me; and he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.”And he who sent me is with me; and he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.” [John 8:29](/en/Bible/John/8#v29)
	> 
> “The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.” [John 14:l0](/en/Bible/John/14#v10)
	> 
> “But when it says, ‘all things are put in subjection under him,’ it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him,” [l Cor 15:27](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/15#v27)
	> 
> “I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me."[John 5:30](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/15#v27)


## XIII. THE TEMPLE DISCUSSIONS

1. **Proposition.** Jesus goes to Jerusalem to celebrate his first Passover.
	> “Jesus, having now reached the threshold of young manhood and having been formally graduated from the synagogue schools, was qualified to proceed to Jerusalem with his parents to participate with them in the celebration of his first Passover. The Passover feast of this year fell on Saturday, April 9, A.D. 7. A considerable company (103) made ready to depart from Nazareth early Monday morning, April 4, for Jerusalem. They journeyed south toward Samaria, but on reaching Jezreel, they turned east, going around Mount Gilboa into the Jordan valley in order to avoid passing through Samaria. Joseph and his family would have enjoyed going down through Samaria by way of Jacob's well and Bethel, but since the Jews disliked to deal with the Samaritans, they decided to go with their neighbors by way of the Jordan valley. ”Jesus, having now reached the threshold of young manhood and having been formally graduated from the synagogue schools, was qualified to proceed to Jerusalem with his parents to participate with them in the celebration of his first Passover.

2. **Proposition.** The Nazareth family meets Simon and his Bethany family.
	> “On the eastern slopes of Olivet they paused for rest in the borders of a little village called Bethany. The hospitable villagers poured forth to minister to the pilgrims, and it happened that Joseph and his family had stopped near the house of one Simon, who had three children about the same age as Jesus — Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. They invited the Nazareth family in for refreshment, and a lifelong friendship sprang up between the two families. Many times afterward, in his eventful life, Jesus stopped in this home. [UB 124:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_9)

3. **Proposition.** Joseph takes Jesus to visit the academy - but the boy shows little interest.
	> “While all Jerusalem was astir in preparation for the Passover, Joseph found time to take his son around to visit the academy where it had been arranged for him to resume his education two years later, as soon as he reached the required age of fifteen. Joseph was truly puzzled when he observed how little interest Jesus evinced in all these carefully laid plans.” [UB 124:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_13)

4. **Proposition.** The week following Passover was the first period of complete freedom from responsibility Jesus had ever enjoyed.
	> “No incident in all Jesus' eventful earth career was more engaging, more humanly thrilling, than this, his first remembered visit to Jerusalem. He was especially stimulated by the experience of attending the temple discussions by himself, and it long stood out in his memory as the great event of his later childhood and early youth. This was his first opportunity to enjoy a few days of independent living, the exhilaration of going and coming without restraint and restrictions. This brief period of undirected living, during the week following the Passover, was the first complete freedom from responsibility he had ever enjoyed. And it was many years subsequent to this before he again had a like period of freedom from all sense of responsibility, even for a short time. [UB 125:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_1)

5. **Proposition.** He was disappointed by the perfunctory nature of the consecration rituals, but was intrigued by contemplation of the spiritual significance of the temple ceremonies.
	> “He passed through the consecration rituals but was disappointed by their perfunctory and routine natures. He missed that personal interest which characterized the ceremonies of the synagogue at Nazareth. He then returned to greet his mother and prepared to accompany his father on his first trip about the temple and its various courts, galleries, and corridors. The temple precincts could accommodate over two hundred thousand worshipers at one time, and while the vastness of these buildings — in comparison with any he had ever seen — greatly impressed his mind, he was more intrigued by the contemplation of the spiritual significance of the temple ceremonies and their associated worship. [UB 125:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_5)

6. **Proposition.** The Nazareth lad was sickened by the sights and sounds of animal slaughter.
	> “They now passed down to the priests' court beneath the rock ledge in front of the temple, where the altar stood, to observe the killing of the droves of animals and the washing away of the blood from the hands of the officiating slaughter priests at the bronze fountain. The bloodstained pavement, the gory hands of the priests, and the sounds of the dying animals were more than this nature-loving lad could stand. The terrible sight sickened this boy of Nazareth; he clutched his father's arm and begged to be taken away. They walked back through the court of the gentiles, and even the coarse laughter and profane jesting which he there heard were a relief from the sights he had just beheld. [UB 125:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p1_4)

7. **Proposition.** Jesus meditated on celebrating the Passover without the slaughtered lamb.
	> “Even at this early date, though he said nothing about such matters to his parents, Jesus had begun to turn over in his mind the propriety of celebrating the Passover without the slaughtered lamb. He felt assured in his own mind that the Father in heaven was not pleased with this spectacle of sacrificial offerings, and as the years passed, he became increasingly determined someday to establish the celebration of a bloodless Passover. [UB 125:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_3)

8. **Proposition**. Jesus' sleep was disturbed by dreams of slaughter and his mind distraught by the absurdities of Jewish theology.
	> “Jesus slept very little that night. His rest was greatly disturbed by revolting dreams of slaughter and suffering. His mind was distraught and his heart torn by the inconsistencies and absurdities of the theology of the whole Jewish ceremonial system. His parents likewise slept little. They were greatly disconcerted by the events of the day just ended. They were completely upset in their own hearts by the lad's, to them, strange and determined attitude. Mary became nervously agitated during the fore part of the night, but Joseph remained calm, though he was equally puzzled. Both of them feared to talk frankly with the lad about these problems, though Jesus would gladly have talked with his parents if they had dared to encourage him.” [UB 125:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_4)

9. **Proposition**. With the Bethany youth, Jesus discussed things temporal and eternal, human and divine.
	> “On Wednesday of the Passover week, Jesus was permitted to go home with Lazarus to spend the night at Bethany. This evening, Lazarus, Martha, and Mary heard Jesus discuss things temporal and eternal, human and divine, and from that night on they all three loved him as if he had been their own brother.” [UB 125:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_7)

10. **Proposition.** Returning to Nazareth, Joseph and Mary did not miss Jesus until they arrived at Jericho.
	> “The Nazareth travelers did not miss Jesus because Mary surmised he journeyed with the men, while Joseph thought he traveled with the women since he had gone up to Jerusalem with the women, leading Mary's donkey. They did not discover his absence until they reached Jericho and prepared to tarry for the night. After making inquiry of the last of the party to reach Jericho and learning that none of them had seen their son, they spent a sleepless night, turning over in their minds what might have happened to him, recounting many of his unusual reactions to the events of Passover week, and mildly chiding each other for not seeing to it that he was in the group before they left Jerusalem. [UB 125:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p3_2)

11. **Proposition.** At the temple discussions, Jesus is confronted with difficulties because of his youth, his Nazareth nativity, etc.
	> “At the second conference Jesus had made bold to ask questions, and in a very amazing way he participated in the temple discussions but always in a manner consistent with his youth. Sometimes his pointed questions were somewhat embarrassing to the learned teachers of the Jewish law, but he evinced such a spirit of candid fairness, coupled with an evident hunger for knowledge, that the majority of the temple teachers were disposed to treat him with every consideration. But when he presumed to question the justice of putting to death a drunken gentile who had wandered outside the court of the gentiles and unwittingly entered the forbidden and reputedly sacred precincts of the temple, one of the more intolerant teachers grew impatient with the lad's implied criticisms and, glowering down upon him, asked how old he was. Jesus replied, ”thirteen years lacking a trifle more than four months.“Then,” rejoined the now irate teacher, “why are you here, since you are not of age as a son of the law?” And when Jesus explained that he had received consecration during the Passover, and that he was a finished student of the Nazareth schools, the teachers with one accord derisively replied, “We might have known; he is from Nazareth.” But the leader insisted that Jesus was not to be blamed if the rulers of the synagogue at Nazareth had graduated him, technically, when he was twelve instead of thirteen; and notwithstanding that several of his detractors got up and left, it was ruled that the lad might continue undisturbed as a pupil of the temple discussions. [UB 125:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p4_3)

12. **Proposition.** Jesus conveyed his teachings by his thought-provoking and heart-searching questions.
	> “And all the day through, those who listened marveled at these questions, and none was more astonished than Simon. For more than four hours this Nazareth youth plied these Jewish teachers with thought-provoking and heart-searching questions. He made few comments on the remarks of his elders. He conveyed his teaching by the questions he would ask. By the deft and subtle phrasing of a question he would at one and the same time challenge their teaching and suggest his own.” [UB 125:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p5_8)

13. **Proposition.** Jesus focused the attention of the temple teachers upon pointed questions.
	> “Before the day had ended, the entire attention of the chief discussion group of the temple had become focused upon the questions being asked by Jesus. Among his many questions were:
	> 
	> 1. What really exists in the holy of holies, behind the veil?
	> 
	> 2. Why should mothers in Israel be segregated from the male temple worshipers?
	> 
	> 3. If God is a father who loves his children, why all this slaughter of animals to gain divine favor — has the teaching of Moses been misunderstood?
	> 
	> 4. Since the temple is dedicated to the worship of the Father in heaven, is it consistent to permit the presence of those who engage in secular barter and trade?
	> 
	> 5. Is the expected Messiah to become a temporal prince to sit on the throne of David, or is he to function as the light of life in the establishment of a spiritual kingdom?”[UB 125:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p5_2)

14. **Proposition.** Even when this truth-seeking lad sought divine help the clear light did not always come.
	> “After the evening meal at Bethany he again declined to join the merry circle but instead went to the garden, where he lingered long into the night, vainly endeavoring to think out some definite plan of approach to the problem of his lifework and to decide how best he might labor to reveal to his spiritually blinded countrymen a more beautiful concept of the heavenly Father and so set them free from their terrible bondage to law, ritual, ceremonial, and musty tradition. But the clear light did not come to the truth-seeking lad.” [UB 125:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p5_10)

15. **Proposition.** He did not seem to comprehend that his parents would be worried about his having been left behind.
	> “Jesus was strangely unmindful of his earthly parents; even at breakfast, when Lazarus's mother remarked that his parents must be about home by that time, Jesus did not seem to comprehend that they would be somewhat worried about his having lingered behind.”Jesus was strangely unmindful of his earthly parents; even at breakfast, when Lazarus's mother remarked that his parents must be about home by that time, Jesus did not seem to comprehend that they would be somewhat worried about his having lingered behind.” [UB 125:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_1)

16. **Proposition**. Strolling through the temple, his parents were amazed to hear Jesus' voice and observe him sitting among the temple teachers.
	> “The evening before, Jesus' parents had heard about this strange youth who so deftly sparred with the expounders of the law, but it had not occurred to them that this lad was their son. They had about decided to journey out to the home of Zacharias as they thought Jesus might have gone thither to see Elizabeth and John. Thinking Zacharias might perhaps be at the temple, they stopped there on their way to the City of Judah. As they strolled through the courts of the temple, imagine their surprise and amazement when they recognized the voice of the missing lad and beheld him seated among the temple teachers.” [UB 125:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_4)

17. **Proposition**. It was a tense moment - Joseph was speechless, but Mary gave vent to her long pent-up anxiety
	> “Joseph was speechless, but Mary gave vent to her long-pent-up fear and anxiety when, rushing up to the lad, now standing to greet his astonished parents, she said: ”My child, why have you treated us like this? It is now more than three days that your father and I have searched for you sorrowing. Whatever possessed you to desert us?" It was a tense moment. All eyes were turned on Jesus to hear what he would say. His father looked reprovingly at him but said nothing. [UB 125:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_5)

18. **Proposition.** Mary mildly upbraided Jesus and so terminated one of the most sublime efforts of his young life.
	> “It should be remembered that Jesus was supposed to be a young man. He had finished the regular schooling of a child, had been recognized as a son of the law, and had received consecration as a citizen of Israel. And yet his mother more than mildly upbraided him before all the people assembled, right in the midst of the most serious and sublime effort of his young life, thus bringing to an inglorious termination one of the greatest opportunities ever to be granted him to function as a teacher of truth, a preacher of righteousness, a revealer of the loving character of his Father in heaven.” [UB 125:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_6)

19. **Proposition**. Jesus' reply to his mother was both considerate and wise.
	> “But the lad was equal to the occasion. When you take into fair consideration all the factors which combined to make up this situation, you will be better prepared to fathom the wisdom of the boy's reply to his mother's unintended rebuke. After a moment's thought, Jesus answered his mother, saying: ‘Why is it that you have so long sought me? Would you not expect to find me in my Father's house since the time has come when I should be about my Father's business?’” [UB 125:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p6_7)

## XIV. ADOLESCENT EXPERIENCES

1. **Proposition**. Jesus studied the flowers by day and the stars by night.
	> “Much of his spare time — when his mother did not require his help about the house — was spent studying the flowers and plants by day and the stars by night. He evinced a troublesome penchant for lying on his back and gazing wonderingly up into the starry heavens long after his usual bedtime in this well-ordered Nazareth household. ”Much of his spare time — when his mother did not require his help about the house — was spent studying the flowers and plants by day and the stars by night. He evinced a troublesome penchant for lying on his back and gazing wonderingly up into the starry heavens long after his usual bedtime in this well-ordered Nazareth household.” [UB 123:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_10)

2. **Proposition**. He worked on a farm and was interested in how his fellows made a living.
	> “In May of this year, on his uncle's farm, Jesus for the first time helped with the harvest of the grain. Before he was thirteen, he had managed to find out something about practically everything that men and women worked at around Nazareth except metal working, and he spent several months in a smith's shop when older, after the death of his father. [UB 124:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_11)

3. **Proposition.** Jesus' unwillingness to fight for his rights occasioned little trouble because his chum Jacob was an ever-ready defender.
	> “Perhaps his most unusual and outstanding trait was his unwillingness to fight for his rights. Since he was such a well-developed lad for his age, it seemed strange to his playfellows that he was disinclined to defend himself even from injustice or when subjected to personal abuse. As it happened, he did not suffer much on account of this trait because of the friendship of Jacob, a neighbor boy, who was one year older. He was the son of the stone mason, a business associate of Joseph. Jacob was a great admirer of Jesus and made it his business to see that no one was permitted to impose upon Jesus because of his aversion to physical combat. Several times older and uncouth youths attacked Jesus, relying upon his reputed docility, but they always suffered swift and certain retribution at the hands of his self-appointed champion and ever-ready defender, Jacob the stone mason's son.” [UB 124:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_4)

4. **Proposition.** He was an alert pupil, well socialized, a director in play, and a born teacher.
	> “His physical development continued; he was an advanced and privileged pupil at school; he got along fairly well at home with his younger brothers and sisters, having the advantage of being three and one-half years older than the oldest of the other children. He was well thought of in Nazareth except by the parents of some of the duller children, who often spoke of Jesus as being too pert, as lacking in proper humility and youthful reserve. He manifested a growing tendency to direct the play activities of his youthful associates into more serious and thoughtful channels. He was a born teacher and simply could not refrain from so functioning, even when supposedly engaged in play.” [UB 124:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_8)

5. **Proposition**. Jesus once thought of becoming a fisherman, but finally decided on carpentry.
	> “When on his first trip with his father to observe the fishing industry on the lake of Galilee, Jesus had just about made up his mind to become a fisherman; but close association with his father's vocation later on influenced him to become a carpenter, while still later a combination of influences led him to the final choice of becoming a religious teacher of a new order. [UB 124:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_10)

6. **Proposition**. His knowledge of international affairs was gained from the travelers he met at the caravan repair shop.
	> “Jesus spent considerable time at the caravan supply shop, and by conversing with the travelers from all parts of the world, he acquired a store of information about international affairs that was amazing, considering his age. This was the last year in which he enjoyed much free play and youthful joyousness. From this time on difficulties and responsibilities rapidly multiplied in the life of this youth.” [UB 124:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_3)

7. **Proposition.** Joseph and Mary were frustrated about Jesus because nothing miraculous ever happened.
	> “By the beginning of this year both Joseph and Mary entertained frequent doubts about the destiny of their first-born son. He was indeed a brilliant and lovable child, but he was so difficult to understand, so hard to fathom, and again, nothing extraordinary or miraculous ever happened. Scores of times had his proud mother stood in breathless anticipation, expecting to see her son engage in some superhuman or miraculous performance, but always were her hopes dashed down in cruel disappointment. And all this was discouraging, even disheartening. The devout people of those days truly believed that prophets and men of promise always demonstrated their calling and established their divine authority by performing miracles and working wonders. But Jesus did none of these things; wherefore was the confusion of his parents steadily increased as they contemplated his future.” [UB 126:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_5)

8. **Proposition.** At the end of fifteen years the growth of mind and body had ended - now began the career of this young man of Nazareth.
	> “With the close of this fifteenth year Jesus completed the traversal of that dangerous and difficult period in human existence, that time of transition between the more complacent years of childhood and the consciousness of approaching manhood with its increased responsibilities and opportunities for the acquirement of advanced experience in the development of a noble character. The growth period for mind and body had ended, and now began the real career of this young man of Nazareth.” [UB 126:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_12)

## XV. EARLY MANHOOD

1. **Proposition**. The ‘Lord's Prayer’ was an evolution of the Nazareth family altar.
	> “During this year Jesus first formulated the prayer which he subsequently taught to his apostles, and which to many has become known as ‘The Lord's Prayer.’ In a way it was an evolution of the family altar; they had many forms of praise and several formal prayers. After his father's death Jesus tried to teach the older children to express themselves individually in prayer — much as he so enjoyed doing — but they could not grasp his thought and would invariably fall back upon their memorized prayer forms. It was in this effort to stimulate his older brothers and sisters to say individual prayers that Jesus would endeavor to lead them along by suggestive phrases, and presently, without intention on his part, it developed that they were all using a form of prayer which was largely built up from these suggestive lines which Jesus had taught them.” [UB 126:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_3)

2. **Proposition**. Jesus was frequently thwarted and frustrated, but never discouraged.
	> “Apparently all Jesus' plans for a career were thwarted. The future did not look bright as matters now developed. But he did not falter; he was not discouraged. He lived on, day by day, doing well the present duty and faithfully discharging the _immediate_ responsibilities of his station in life. Jesus' life is the everlasting comfort of all disappointed idealists.” [UB 126:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_4)

3. **Proposition.** He grew up to manhood, passing through all the conflicts and confusions of average youth.
	> “As he grew up to manhood, he passed through all those conflicts and confusions which the average young persons of previous and subsequent ages have undergone. And the rigorous experience of supporting his family was a sure safeguard against his having overmuch time for idle meditation or the indulgence of mystic tendencies.” [UB 126:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_9)

4. **Proposition.** Even though his mother favored it, Jesus refused to join the Zealots.
	> “A group of organizers from Jerusalem arrived in Galilee and were making good headway until they reached Nazareth. When they came to see Jesus, he listened carefully to them and asked many questions but refused to join the party. He declined fully to disclose his reasons for not enlisting, and his refusal had the effect of keeping out many of his youthful fellows in Nazareth.”
	> 
	> Mary did her best to induce him to enlist, but she could not budge him. She went so far as to intimate that his refusal to espouse the nationalist cause at her behest was insubordination, a violation of his pledge made upon their return from Jerusalem that he would be subject to his parents; but in answer to this insinuation he only laid a kindly hand on her shoulder and, looking into her face, said: “My mother, how could you?” And Mary withdrew her statement.” [UB 127:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_2)

5. **Proposition.** At seventeen he was confronted by a delicate and difficult patriotic issue.
	> “Jesus, then scarcely seventeen years of age, was confronted with one of the most delicate and difficult situations of his early life. Patriotic issues, especially when complicated by tax-gathering foreign oppressors, are always difficult for spiritual leaders to relate themselves to, and it was doubly so in this case since the Jewish religion was involved in all this agitation against Rome.” [UB 127:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_6)

6. **Proposition**. Agitation persisted - he was never again in universal favor. This was the chief reason for moving to Capernaum.
	> “The crisis for the time being was over, but never was this incident forgotten in Nazareth. The agitation persisted; not again was Jesus in universal favor; the division of sentiment was never fully overcome. And this, augmented by other and subsequent occurrences, was one of the chief reasons why he moved to Capernaum in later years. Henceforth Nazareth maintained a division of sentiment regarding the Son of Man.” [UB 127:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_10)

7. **Proposition**. As young men, Jesus and John the Baptist had a visit. At this time they decided not to see each other again until they should meet in their public work.
	> “Jesus and John had many talks together; and they talked over some very intimate and personal matters. When they had finished this visit, they decided not again to see each other until they should meet in their public service after ‘the heavenly Father should call’ them to their work. John was tremendously impressed by what he saw at Nazareth that he should return home and labor for the support of his mother. He became convinced that he was to be a part of Jesus' life mission, but he saw that Jesus was to occupy many years with the rearing of his family; so he was much more content to return to his home and settle down to the care of their little farm and to minister to the needs of his mother. And never again did John and Jesus see each other until that day by the Jordan when the Son of Man presented himself for baptism.” [UB 127:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_12)

8. **Proposition.** By his conduct at the death of Amos, Jesus became the real head of the family.
	> “On Saturday afternoon, December 3, of this year, death for the second time struck at this Nazareth family. Little Amos, their baby brother, died after a week's illness with a high fever. After passing through this time of sorrow with her first-born son as her only support, Mary at last and in the fullest sense recognized Jesus as the real head of the family; and he was truly a worthy head.” [UB 127:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_13)

9. **Proposition.** Jesus could mobilize his mind and focus his attention on a task - he could live as if “seeing Him who is invisible.”
	> “Jesus possessed the ability effectively to mobilize all his powers of mind, soul, and body on the task immediately in hand. He could concentrate his deep-thinking mind on the one problem which he wished to solve, and this, in connection with his untiring patience, enabled him serenely to endure the trials of a difficult mortal existence — to live as if he were ‘seeing Him who is invisible.’” [UB 127:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_15)

10. **Proposition.** Rebecca falls in love with Jesus.
	> “Although Jesus was poor, his social standing in Nazareth was in no way impaired. He was one of the foremost young men of the city and very highly regarded by most of the young women. Since Jesus was such a splendid specimen of robust and intellectual manhood, and considering his reputation as a spiritual leader, it was not strange that Rebecca, the eldest daughter of Ezra, a wealthy merchant and trader of Nazareth, should discover that she was slowly falling in love with this son of Joseph. She first confided her affection to Miriam, Jesus' sister, and Miriam in turn talked all this over with her mother. Mary was intensely aroused. Was she about to lose her son, now become the indispensable head of the family? Would troubles never cease? What next could happen? And then she paused to contemplate what effect marriage would have upon Jesus' future career; not often, but at least sometimes, did she recall the fact that Jesus was a ‘child of promise.’” [UB 127:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p5_1)

11. **Proposition.** Rebecca, failing with Mary and Miriam, goes directly to Jesus.
	> “She interpreted Mary's efforts to dissuade her as a natural reaction to the dread of losing the head and sole support of her family; but knowing that her father approved of her attraction for the carpenter's son, she rightly reckoned that he would gladly supply the family with sufficient income fully to compensate for the loss of Jesus' earnings. When her father agreed to such a plan, Rebecca had further conferences with Mary and Miriam, and when she failed to win their support, she made bold to go directly to Jesus. This she did with the co-operation of her father, who invited Jesus to their home for the celebration of Rebecca's seventeenth birthday.” [UB 127:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p5_2)

12. **Proposition.** For many reasons, Jesus kindly but firmly declines Rebecca's devotion.
	> “Jesus listened attentively and sympathetically to the recital of these things, first by the father, then by Rebecca herself. He made kindly reply to the effect that no amount of money could take the place of his obligation personally to rear his father's family, to ‘fulfill the most sacred of all human trusts — loyalty to one's own flesh and blood.’ Rebecca's father was deeply touched by Jesus' words of family devotion and retired from the conference. His only remark to Mary, his wife, was: ‘We can't have him for a son; he is too noble for us.’”
	> 
	> “Then began that eventful talk with Rebecca. Thus far in his life, Jesus had made little distinction in his association with boys and girls, with young men and young women. His mind had been altogether too much occupied with the pressing problems of practical earthly affairs and the intriguing contemplation of his eventual career ‘about his Father's business’ ever to have given serious consideration to the consummation of personal love in human marriage. But now he was face to face with another of those problems which every average human being must confront and decide. Indeed was he ‘tested in all points like as you are.’” [UB 127:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p5_3)

13. **Proposition.** Rebecca was broken-hearted. She followed him throughout his eventful life and was present at the crucifixion.
	> “Rebecca was heartbroken. She refused to be comforted and importuned her father to leave Nazareth until he finally consented to move to Sepphoris. In after years, to the many men who sought her hand in marriage, Rebecca had but one answer. She lived for only one purpose — to await the hour when this, to her, the greatest man who ever lived would begin his career as a teacher of living truth. And she followed him devotedly through his eventful years of public labor, being present (unobserved by Jesus) that day when he rode triumphantly into Jerusalem; and she stood ‘among the other women’ by the side of Mary on that fateful and tragic afternoon when the Son of Man hung upon the cross, to her, as well as to countless worlds on high, ‘the one altogether lovely and the greatest among ten thousand.’” [UB 127:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p5_6)

14. **Proposition.** Jesus celebrated the ”bloodless Passover" with the Bethany youngsters. He had a periodic outbreak of resentment against tradition.
	> “On this visit occurred one of those periodic outbreaks of rebellion against tradition — the expression of resentment for those ceremonial practices which Jesus deemed misrepresentative of his Father in heaven. Not knowing Jesus was coming, Lazarus had arranged to celebrate the Passover with friends in an adjoining village down the Jericho road. Jesus now proposed that they celebrate the feast where they were, at Lazarus's house. ‘But,’ said Lazarus, ‘we have no paschal lamb.’ And then Jesus entered upon a prolonged and convincing dissertation to the effect that the Father in heaven was not truly concerned with such childlike and meaningless rituals. After solemn and fervent prayer they rose, and Jesus said: ‘Let the childlike and darkened minds of my people serve their God as Moses directed; it is better that they do, but let us who have seen the light of life no longer approach our Father by the darkness of death. Let us be free in the knowledge of the truth of our Father's eternal love.’” [UB 127:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_6)

15. **Proposition.** He is learning to bear responsibility and face disappointment. He adjusts distant goals of idealism to present goals of necessity.
	> “Jesus is rapidly becoming a man, not just a young man but an adult. He has learned well to bear responsibility. He knows how to carry on in the face of disappointment. He bears up bravely when his plans are thwarted and his purposes temporarily defeated. He has learned how to be fair and just even in the face of injustice. He is learning how to adjust his ideals of spiritual living to the practical demands of earthly existence. He is learning how to plan for the achievement of a higher and distant goal of idealism while he toils earnestly for the attainment of a nearer and immediate goal of necessity. He is steadily acquiring the art of adjusting his aspirations to the commonplace demands of the human occasion.” l27.” [UB 127:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_12)

16. **Proposition.** Jesus is mastering the technique of:
	- a. Using the energy of the spiritual drive to turn the mechanism of material achievement.
	- b. Living the heavenly life in the earthly existence.
	- c. Wresting victory from the jaws of defeat.
	- d. Transforming the difficulties of time into the triumphs of eternity.
	> “He has very nearly mastered the technique of utilizing the energy of the spiritual drive to turn the mechanism of material achievement. He is slowly learning how to live the heavenly life while he continues on with the earthly existence. More and more he depends upon the ultimate guidance of his heavenly Father while he assumes the fatherly role of guiding and directing the children of his earth family. He is becoming experienced in the skillful wresting of victory from the very jaws of defeat; he is learning how to transform the difficulties of time into the triumphs of eternity.” [UB 127:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_12)

17. **Proposition**. Jesus lived to the full the life in the flesh. He is an understanding brother, sympathetic friend, experienced sovereign, and merciful father.
	> “And so, as the years pass, this young man of Nazareth continues to experience life as it is lived in mortal flesh on the worlds of time and space. He lives a full, representative, and replete life on Urantia. He left this world ripe in the experience which his creatures pass through during the short and strenuous years of their first life, the life in the flesh. And all this human experience is an eternal possession of the Universe Sovereign. He is our understanding brother, sympathetic friend, experienced sovereign, and merciful father.” [UB 127:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_13)

18. **Proposition.** Jesus stands on the threshold of manhood, rich in human experience and full of sympathy for the frailties of human nature.
	> “Born into the world a babe of the realm, he has lived his childhood life and passed through the successive stages of youth and young manhood; he now stands on the threshold of full manhood, rich in the experience of human living, replete in the understanding of human nature, and full of sympathy for the frailties of human nature. He is becoming expert in the divine art of revealing his Paradise Father to all ages and stages of mortal creatures.” [UB 127:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_15)

19. **Proposition.** He lived a normal and average human 1ife - wrestling with the vicissitudes of mortal environment.
	> “As Jesus of Nazareth entered upon the early years of his adult life, he had lived, and continued to live, a normal and average human life on earth. Jesus came into this world just as other children come; he had nothing to do with selecting his parents. He did choose this particular world as the planet whereon to carry out his seventh and final bestowal, his incarnation in the likeness of mortal flesh, but otherwise he entered the world in a natural manner, growing up as a child of the realm and wrestling with the vicissitudes of his environment just as do other mortals on this and on similar worlds.” [UB 128:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p0_1)

20. **Proposition.** Always he mindful of the twofold purpose of the Michael bestowal.
	> “Always be mindful of the twofold purpose of Michael's bestowal on Urantia:
	> 
	> 1. The mastering of the experience of living the full life of a human creature in mortal flesh, the completion of his sovereignty in Nebadon.
	> 
	> 2. The revelation of the Universal Father to the mortal dwellers on the worlds of time and space and the more effective leading of these same mortals to a better understanding of the Universal Father.” [UB 128:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p0_2)

21. **Proposition.** As a man he entered upon the stupendous task of realizing his dual nature - the personality of Jesus of Nazareth.
	> “With the attainment of adult years Jesus began in earnest and with full self-consciousness the task of completing the experience of mastering the knowledge of the life of his lowest form of intelligent creatures, thereby finally and fully earning the right of unqualified rulership of his self-created universe. He entered upon this stupendous task fully realizing his dual nature. But he had already effectively combined these two natures into one — Jesus of Nazareth.” [UB 128:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_1)

22. **Proposition.** Jesus was made flesh and dwelt among us - experienced the full gamut of human emotions - "in all things tested, even as you are.” He still bears the title ”Son of Man.”
	> “Joshua ben Joseph knew full well that he was a man, a mortal man, born of woman. This is shown in the selection of his first title, the _Son of Man._ He was truly a partaker of flesh and blood, and even now, as he presides in sovereign authority over the destinies of a universe, he still bears among his numerous well-earned titles that of Son of Man. It is literally true that the creative Word — the Creator Son — of the Universal Father was ”made flesh and dwelt as a man of the realm on Urantia.“ He labored, grew weary, rested, and slept. He hungered and satisfied such cravings with food; he thirsted and quenched his thirst with water. He experienced the full gamut of human feelings and emotions; he was ”in all things tested, even as you are,“ and he suffered and died.” [UB 128:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_2)

3. **Proposition.** He gained wisdom by experience and before his baptism he utilized no superhuman power. He was a true man among men.
	> “He obtained knowledge, gained experience, and combined these into wisdom, just as do other mortals of the realm. Until after his baptism he availed himself of no supernatural power. He employed no agency not a part of his human endowment as a son of Joseph and Mary.
	> 
	> “As to the attributes of his prehuman existence, he emptied himself. Prior to the beginning of his public work his knowledge of men and events was wholly self-limited. He was a true man among men.” [UB 128:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_3)

4. **Proposition.** It is forever true: “We have a high ruler who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.”
	> “It is forever and gloriously true: ”We have a high ruler who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. We have a Sovereign who was in all points tested and tempted like as we are, yet without sin.“ And since he himself has suffered, being tested and tried, he is abundantly able to understand and minister to those who are confused and distressed.” [UB 128:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_5)

## XVI. THE ROME TRIP

1. **Proposition**. One of the touching episodes of the Rome trip was Ganid's proposal that they make a new religion. He was intrigued by Jesus' broadmindedness, fairness, and tolerance.
	> “Then exclaimed Ganid: ‘Teacher, let's you and I make a new religion, one good enough for India and big enough for Rome, and maybe we can trade it to the Jews for Yahweh.’ And Jesus replied: ‘Ganid, religions are not made. The religions of men grow up over long periods of time, while the revelations of God flash upon earth in the lives of the men who reveal God to their fellows.’ But they did not comprehend the meaning of these prophetic words.
	> 
	> “That night after they had retired, Ganid could not sleep. He talked a long time with his father and finally said, ‘You know, father, I sometimes think Joshua is a prophet.’ And his father only sleepily replied, ‘My son, there are others — ’”
	> 
	> “From this day, for the remainder of his natural life, Ganid continued to evolve a religion of his own. He was mightily moved in his own mind by Jesus' broadmindedness, fairness, and tolerance. In all their discussions of philosophy and religion this youth never experienced feelings of resentment or reactions of antagonism..”From this day, for the remainder of his natural life, Ganid continued to evolve a religion of his own. He was mightily moved in his own mind by Jesus' broadmindedness, fairness, and tolerance. In all their discussions of philosophy and religion this youth never experienced feelings of resentment or reactions of antagonism..” [UB 132:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_6)

2. **Proposition**. Ganid did not know - but they were making a new religion - the new way of salvation, the revelation of God to man in Jesus.
	> “What a scene for the celestial intelligences to behold, this spectacle of the Indian lad proposing to the Creator of a universe that they make a new religion! And though the young man did not know it, they were making a new and everlasting religion right then and there — this new way of salvation, the revelation of God to man through, and in, Jesus. That which the lad wanted most to do he was unconsciously actually doing. And it was, and is, ever thus. That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father's will. When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do, happen.” [UB 132:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9)

## XVII. ON MOUNT HERMON

1. **Proposition.** This isolation on Mount Hermon marked the end of Jesus' purely human career, and his full consecration to the remainder of his lifework.
	> “The indwelling Thought Adjuster now led Jesus to forsake the dwelling places of men and betake himself up to Mount Hermon that he might finish his work of mastering his human mind and complete the task of effecting his full consecration to the remainder of his lifework on earth.
	> 
	> “This was one of those unusual and extraordinary epochs in the Master's earth life on Urantia. Another and very similar one was the experience he passed through when alone in the hills near Pella just subsequent to his baptism. This period of isolation on Mount Hermon marked the termination of his purely human career, that is, the technical termination of the mortal bestowal, while the later isolation marked the beginning of the more divine phase of the bestowal. And Jesus lived alone with God for six weeks on the slopes of Mount Hermon.” [UB 134:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p7_6)

2. **Proposition**. Jesus dismissed his guardian seraphim and entered the great test with only his Adjuster to guide him.
	> “The first day, after he had left Tiglath, Jesus had ascended the mountain only a short way when he paused to pray. Among other things he asked his Father to send back the guardian seraphim to ‘be with Tiglath.’ He requested that he be permitted to go up to his last struggle with the realities of mortal existence alone. And his request was granted. He went into the great test with only his indwelling Adjuster to guide and sustain him.” [UB 134:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_2)

3. **Proposition**. Jesus contended with real enemies - not the phantasms of a weakened and starving mind.
	> “Jesus ate frugally while on the mountain; he abstained from all food only a day or two at a time. The superhuman beings who confronted him on this mountain, and with whom he wrestled in spirit, and whom he defeated in power, were real; they were his archenemies in the system of Satania; they were not phantasms of the imagination evolved out of the intellectual vagaries of a weakened and starving mortal who could not distinguish reality from the visions of a disordered mind.” [UB 134:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_3)

4. **Proposition**. On Mount Hermon, Jesus completed the mastery of mind and attained the goal of human achievement. He could assert the ascendancy of his divine nature over his human nature.
	> “Jesus spent the last three weeks of August and the first three weeks of September on Mount Hermon. During these weeks he finished the mortal task of achieving the circles of mind-understanding and personality-control. Throughout this period of communion with his heavenly Father the indwelling Adjuster also completed the assigned services. The mortal goal of this earth creature was there attained. Only the final phase of mind and Adjuster attunement remained to be consummated.
	> 
	> “After more than five weeks of unbroken communion with his Paradise Father, Jesus became absolutely assured of his nature and of the certainty of his triumph over the material levels of time-space personality manifestation. He fully believed in, and did not hesitate to assert, the ascendancy of his divine nature over his human nature.” [UB 134:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_4)

5. **Proposition.** On the mount the great temptation - the universe trial - occurred. And Jesus won.
	> “Near the end of the mountain sojourn Jesus asked his Father if he might be permitted to hold conference with his Satania enemies as the Son of Man, as Joshua ben Joseph. This request was granted. During the last week on Mount Hermon the great temptation, the universe trial, occurred. Satan (representing Lucifer) and the rebellious Planetary Prince, Caligastia, were present with Jesus and were made fully visible to him. And this ‘temptation,’ this final trial of human loyalty in the face of the misrepresentations of rebel personalities, had not to do with food, temple pinnacles, or presumptuous acts. It had not to do with the kingdoms of this world but with the sovereignty of a mighty and glorious universe. The symbolism of your records was intended for the backward ages of the world's childlike thought. And subsequent generations should understand what a great struggle the Son of Man passed through that eventful day on Mount Hermon.” [UB 134:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_6)

6. **Proposition**. On a summer's day, amid the silence of nature, Michael of Nebadon won the unquestioned sovereignty of his universe.
	> “On an afternoon in late summer, amid the trees and in the silence of nature, Michael of Nebadon won the unquestioned sovereignty of his universe. On that day he completed the task set for Creator Sons to live to the full the incarnated life in the likeness of mortal flesh on the evolutionary worlds of time and space. The universe announcement of this momentous achievement was not made until the day of his baptism, months afterward, but it all really took place that day on the mountain. And when Jesus came down from his sojourn on Mount Hermon, the Lucifer rebellion in Satania and the Caligastia secession on Urantia were virtually settled. Jesus had paid the last price required of him to attain the sovereignty of his universe, which in itself regulates the status of all rebels and determines that all such future upheavals (if they ever occur) may be dealt with summarily and effectively. Accordingly, it may be seen that the so-called ‘great temptation’ of Jesus took place some time before his baptism and not just after that event.” [UB 134:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_9)

## XVIII. BAPTISM

1. **Proposition.** Jesus was baptized as an example for his brothers and that all might know his hour had come.
	> “Being engrossed with the details of rapidly baptizing such a large number of converts, John did not look up to see Jesus until the Son of Man stood in his immediate presence. When John recognized Jesus, the ceremonies were halted for a moment while he greeted his cousin in the flesh and asked, ‘But why do you come down into the water to greet me?’ And Jesus answered, ‘To be subject to your baptism.’ John replied: ‘But I have need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?’ And Jesus whispered to John: ‘Bear with me now, for it becomes us to set this example for my brothers standing here with me, and that the people may know that my hour has come.’” [UB 135:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p8_5)

2. **Proposition.** John baptized Jesus and his brothers and heard the voice: “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.”
	> “There was a tone of finality and authority in Jesus' voice. John was atremble with emotion as he made ready to baptize Jesus of Nazareth in the Jordan at noon on Monday, January 14, A.D. 26. Thus did John baptize Jesus and his two brothers James and Jude. And when John had baptized these three, he dismissed the others for the day, announcing that he would resume baptisms at noon the next day. As the people were departing, the four men still standing in the water heard a strange sound, and presently there appeared for a moment an apparition immediately over the head of Jesus, and they heard a voice saying, ‘This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.’ A great change came over the countenance of Jesus, and coming up out of the water in silence he took leave of them, going toward the hills to the east. And no man saw Jesus again for forty days.” [UB 135:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p8_6)

3. **Proposition**. Jesus stood in the Jordan a perfected mortal of the evolutionary worlds. Perfect synchrony existed between Jesus and his Adjuster.
	> “When Jesus of Nazareth went down into the Jordan to be baptized, he was a mortal of the realm who had attained the pinnacle of human evolutionary ascension in all matters related to the conquest of mind and to self-identification with the spirit. He stood in the Jordan that day a perfected mortal of the evolutionary worlds of time and space. Perfect synchrony and full communication had become established between the mortal mind of Jesus and the indwelling spirit Adjuster, the divine gift of his Father in Paradise. And just such an Adjuster indwells all normal beings living on Urantia since the ascension of Michael to the headship of his universe, except that Jesus' Adjuster had been previously prepared for this special mission by similarly indwelling another superhuman incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, Machiventa Melchizedek.” [UB 136:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_2)

4. **Proposition.** Ordinarily, when man and his Adjuster are synchronized, fusion occurs. Jesus' Adjuster was personalized and appeared as an apparition.
	> “Ordinarily, when a mortal of the realm attains such high levels of personality perfection, there occur those preliminary phenomena of spiritual elevation which terminate in eventual fusion of the matured soul of the mortal with its associated divine Adjuster. And such a change was apparently due to take place in the personality experience of Jesus of Nazareth on that very day when he went down into the Jordan with his two brothers to be baptized by John. This ceremony was the final act of his purely human life on Urantia, and many superhuman observers expected to witness the fusion of the Adjuster with its indwelt mind, but they were all destined to suffer disappointment. Something new and even greater occurred. As John laid his hands upon Jesus to baptize him, the indwelling Adjuster took final leave of the perfected human soul of Joshua ben Joseph. And in a few moments this divine entity returned from Divinington as a Personalized Adjuster and chief of his kind throughout the entire local universe of Nebadon. Thus did Jesus observe his own former divine spirit descending on its return to him in personalized form. And he heard this same spirit of Paradise origin now speak, saying, ‘This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.’ And John, with Jesus' two brothers, also heard these words. John's disciples, standing by the water's edge, did not hear these words, neither did they see the apparition of the Personalized Adjuster. Only the eyes of Jesus beheld the Personalized Adjuster.” [UB 136:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3)

5. **Proposition.** After the baptism, the Personalized Adjuster presented Jesus with a vision of his prebestowal status as the Son of God.
	> “When the returned and now exalted Personalized Adjuster had thus spoken, all was silence. And while the four of them tarried in the water, Jesus, looking up to the near-by Adjuster, prayed: ‘My Father who reigns in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come! Your will be done on earth, even as it is in heaven.’ When he had prayed, the “heavens were opened,” and the Son of Man saw the vision, presented by the now Personalized Adjuster, of himself as a Son of God as he was before he came to earth in the likeness of mortal flesh, and as he would be when the incarnated life should be finished. This heavenly vision was seen only by Jesus.” [UB 136:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_4)

6. **Proposition.** The baptism ended the purely human life of Jesus.
	> “This day of baptism ended the purely human life of Jesus. The divine Son has found his Father, the Universal Father has found his incarnated Son, and they speak the one to the other.” [UB 136:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_7)

## XIX. THE FORTY DAYS

1. **Proposition**. Jesus endured the great temptation on Mount Hermon. After baptism he spent forty days formulating his technique of proclaiming the new gospel.
	> “Jesus had endured the great temptation of his mortal bestowal before his baptism when he had been wet with the dews of Mount Hermon for six weeks. There on Mount Hermon, as an unaided mortal of the realm, he had met and defeated the Urantia pretender, Caligastia, the prince of this world. That eventful day, on the universe records, Jesus of Nazareth had become the Planetary Prince of Urantia. And this Prince of Urantia, so soon to be proclaimed supreme Sovereign of Nebadon, now went into forty days of retirement to formulate the plans and determine upon the technique of proclaiming the new kingdom of God in the hearts of men.” [UB 136:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p3_1)

2. **Proposition.** Gabriel and the Constellation Father, informed Jesus of the completion of his sovereignty and the bestowal release of Immanuel.
	> “While he tarried on the mountain, talking with Gabriel, the Constellation Father of Edentia appeared to Jesus and Gabriel in person, saying: ‘The records are completed. The sovereignty of Michael No. 611,121 over his universe of Nebadon rests in completion at the right hand of the Universal Father. I bring to you the bestowal release of Immanuel, your sponsor-brother for the Urantia incarnation. You are at liberty now or at any subsequent time, in the manner of your own choosing, to terminate your incarnation bestowal, ascend to the right hand of your Father, receive your sovereignty, and assume your well-earned unconditional rulership of all Nebadon. I also testify to the completion of the records of the superuniverse, by authorization of the Ancients of Days, having to do with the termination of all sin-rebellion in your universe and endowing you with full and unlimited authority to deal with any and all such possible upheavals in the future. Technically, your work on Urantia and in the flesh of the mortal creature is finished. Your course from now on is a matter of your own choosing.’” [UB 136:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p3_5)

3. **Proposition.** The forty days were the period of his great decisions.
	> “The forty days in the mountain wilderness were not a period of great temptation but rather the period of the Master's _great decisions_. During these days of lone communion with himself and his Father's immediate presence — the Personalized Adjuster (he no longer had a personal seraphic guardian) — he arrived, one by one, at the great decisions which were to control his policies and conduct for the remainder of his earth career. Subsequently the tradition of a great temptation became attached to this period of isolation through confusion with the fragmentary narratives of the Mount Hermon struggles, and further because it was the custom to have all great prophets and human leaders begin their public careers by undergoing these supposed seasons of fasting and prayer. It had always been Jesus' practice, when facing any new or serious decisions, to withdraw for communion with his own spirit that he might seek to know the will of God.” [UB 136:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_10)

4. **Proposition.** Jesus decided that he would not utilize the superhuman resources at his disposal unless it was his Father's will.
	> “Jesus decided that he would _not_ utilize a single personality of this vast assemblage unless it should become evident that this was his _Father's will_. Notwithstanding this general decision, this vast host remained with him throughout the balance of his earth life, always in readiness to obey the least expression of their Sovereign's will. Although Jesus did not constantly behold these attendant personalities with his human eyes, his associated Personalized Adjuster did constantly behold, and could communicate with, all of them.” [UB 136:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_2)

5. **Proposition.** The Personalized Adjuster, in taking command of the celestial hosts, reminded Jesus of his inability to limit his life as regards time.
	> “In accepting this command of the universe hosts in attendance upon Christ Michael, the Personalized Adjuster took great pains to point out to Jesus that, while such an assembly of universe creatures could be limited in their _space_ activities by the delegated authority of their Creator, such limitations were not operative in connection with their function in _time_. And this limitation was dependent on the fact that Adjusters are nontime beings when once they are personalized. Accordingly was Jesus admonished that, while the Adjuster's control of the living intelligences placed under his command would be complete and perfect as to all matters involving space, there could be no such perfect limitations imposed regarding _time_. Said the Adjuster: ‘I will, as you have directed, enjoin the employment of this attendant host of universe intelligences in any manner in connection with your earth career except in those cases where the Paradise Father directs me to release such agencies in order that his divine will of your choosing may be accomplished, and in those instances where you may engage in any choice or act of your divine-human will which shall only involve departures from the natural earth order as to time. In all such events I am powerless, and your creatures here assembled in perfection and unity of power are likewise helpless. If your united natures once entertain such desires, these mandates of your choice will be forthwith executed. Your wish in all such matters will constitute the abridgment of time, and the thing projected is existent. Under my command this constitutes the fullest possible limitation which can be imposed upon your potential sovereignty. In my self-consciousness time is nonexistent, and therefore I cannot limit your creatures in anything related thereto.’” [UB 136:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_4)

6. **Proposition.** Jesus could easily limit his activities with reference to space, but not with regard to time.
	> “Through the supervising control of his associated and Personalized Adjuster it was possible for Michael perfectly to limit his personal earth activities with reference to space, but it was not possible for the Son of Man thus to limit his new earth status as potential Sovereign of Nebadon as regards _time_. And this was the actual status of Jesus of Nazareth as he went forth to begin his public ministry on Urantia.” [UB 136:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_6)

## XX. MIRACLES

1. **Proposition.** Jesus refused to be a wonder-worker. He knew that miracles would call forth only superficial a1legiance.
	> “Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.” [UB 136:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p8_2)

2. **Proposition.** Out of tender feelings for his mother, Jesus was led unwittingly to transform water into wine.
	> “Throughout a period of many years, Mary had always turned to Jesus for help in every crisis of their home life at Nazareth so that it was only natural for her to think of him at this time. But this ambitious mother had still other motives for appealing to her eldest son on this occasion. As Jesus was standing alone in a corner of the garden, his mother approached him, saying, ‘My son, they have no wine.’ And Jesus answered, ‘My good woman, what have I to do with that?’ Said Mary, ‘But I believe your hour has come; cannot you help us?’ Jesus replied: ‘Again I declare that I have not come to do things in this wise. Why do you trouble me again with these matters?’ And then, breaking down in tears, Mary entreated him, ‘But, my son, I promised them that you would help us; won't you please do something for me?’ And then spoke Jesus: ‘Woman, what have you to do with making such promises? See that you do it not again. We must in all things wait upon the will of the Father in heaven.’
	> 
	> “Mary the mother of Jesus was crushed; she was stunned! As she stood there before him motionless, with the tears streaming down her face, the human heart of Jesus was overcome with compassion for the woman who had borne him in the flesh; and bending forward, he laid his hand tenderly upon her head, saying: ‘Now, now, Mother Mary, grieve not over my apparently hard sayings, for have I not many times told you that I have come only to do the will of my heavenly Father? Most gladly would I do what you ask of me if it were a part of the Father's will — ’ and Jesus stopped short, he hesitated. Mary seemed to sense that something was happening. Leaping up, she threw her arms around Jesus' neck, kissed him, and rushed off to the servants' quarters, saying, ‘Whatever my son says, that do.’ But Jesus said nothing. He now realized that he had already said — or rather desirefully thought — too much.” [UB 137:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_9)

3. **Proposition**. Mary was gleeful, thinking she had at last induced her son to assert his power.
	> “Mary was dancing with glee. She did not know how the wine would be produced, but she confidently believed that she had finally persuaded her first-born son to assert his authority, to dare to step forth and claim his position and exhibit his Messianic power. And, because of the presence and association of certain universe powers and personalities, of which all those present were wholly ignorant, she was not to be disappointed. The wine Mary desired and which Jesus, the God-man, humanly and sympathetically wished for, was forthcoming.” [UB 137:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_10)

4. **Proposition.** The timeless thing happened - water was turned to wine.
	> “Near at hand stood six waterpots of stone, filled with water, holding about twenty gallons apiece. This water was intended for subsequent use in the final purification ceremonies of the wedding celebration. The commotion of the servants about these huge stone vessels, under the busy direction of his mother, attracted Jesus' attention, and going over, he observed that they were drawing wine out of them by the pitcherful.” [UB 137:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_11)

5. **Proposition**. It dawned upon Jesus what had happened and of all the guests he was the most surprised.
	> “It was gradually dawning upon Jesus what had happened. Of all persons present at the marriage feast of Cana, Jesus was the most surprised. Others had expected him to work a wonder, but that was just what he had purposed not to do. And then the Son of Man recalled the admonition of his Personalized Thought Adjuster in the hills. He recounted how the Adjuster had warned him about the inability of any power or personality to deprive him of the creator prerogative of independence of time. On this occasion power transformers, midwayers, and all other required personalities were assembled near the water and other necessary elements, and in the face of the expressed wish of the Universe Creator Sovereign, there was no escaping the instantaneous appearance of wine. And this occurrence was made doubly certain since the Personalized Adjuster had signified that the execution of the Son's desire was in no way a contravention of the Father's will.” [UB 137:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_12)

6. **Proposition.** The curing of the man with a withered hand is the first miracle wrought in response to the challenge of his enemies and was designed as a protest against Sabbath bondage.
	> “This is the first case of a miracle to be wrought by Jesus in response to the challenge of his enemies. And the Master performed this so-called miracle, not as a demonstration of his healing power, but as an effective protest against making the Sabbath rest of religion a veritable bondage of meaningless restrictions upon all mankind. This man returned to his work as a stone mason, proving to be one of those whose healing was followed by a life of thanksgiving and righteousness.” [UB 148:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p7_4)

7. **Proposition.** Throughout Jesus' ministry there occurred a succession of unexplained healing phenomena. A probable explanation is suggested.” [UB 149:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_2)

8. **Proposition**. Jesus miraculously fed five thousand men, women, and children.
	> “Jesus took up the loaves in his hands, and after he had given thanks, he broke the bread and gave to his apostles, who passed it on to their associates, who in turn carried it to the multitude. Jesus in like manner broke and distributed the fishes. And this multitude did eat and were filled. And when they had finished eating, Jesus said to the disciples: ”Gather up the broken pieces that remain over so that nothing will be lost.“ And when they had finished gathering up the fragments, they had twelve basketfuls. They who ate of this extraordinary feast numbered about five thousand men, women, and children.” [UB 152:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_9)

9. **Proposition.** This is the first and only nature miracle that Jesus performed.
	> “And this is the first and only nature miracle which Jesus performed as a result of his conscious preplanning. It is true that his disciples were disposed to call many things miracles which were not, but this was a genuine supernatural ministration. In this case, so we were taught, Michael multiplied food elements as he always does except for the elimination of the time factor and the visible life channel” [UB 152:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_10)

10. **Proposition**. Jesus refused to be king and exhorted the multitude to let the Father of lights be enthroned in their hearts.
	> “This mighty shout enthused Peter and those of the apostles who still retained the hope of seeing Jesus assert his right to rule. But these false hopes were not to live for long. This mighty shout of the multitude had hardly ceased to reverberate from the near-by rocks when Jesus stepped upon a huge stone and, lifting up his right hand to command their attention, said: ‘My children, you mean well, but you are short-sighted and material-minded.’ There was a brief pause; this stalwart Galilean was there majestically posed in the enchanting glow of that eastern twilight. Every inch he looked a king as he continued to speak to this breathless multitude: ‘You would make me king, not because your souls have been lighted with a great truth, but because your stomachs have been filled with bread. How many times have I told you that my kingdom is not of this world? This kingdom of heaven which we proclaim is a spiritual brotherhood, and no man rules over it seated upon a material throne. My Father in heaven is the all-wise and the all-powerful Ruler over this spiritual brotherhood of the sons of God on earth. Have I so failed in revealing to you the Father of spirits that you would make a king of his Son in the flesh! Now all of you go hence to your own homes. If you must have a king, let the Father of lights be enthroned in the heart of each of you as the spirit Ruler of all things.’” [UB 152:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p3_2)

## XXI. PETER'S CONFESSION

1. **Proposition.** As they paused for lunch, Jesus asked a surprising question: “Who do men say that I am?”
	> “As they paused for lunch, Jesus suddenly confronted the twelve with the first question he had ever addressed to them concerning himself. He asked this surprising question, ‘Who do men say that I am?’” [UB 157:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_3)

2. **Proposition**. After hearing that he had been compared to many of the olden prophets Jesus asked: “But who say you that I am?” Peter replied: ”You are the Deliverer, the Son of the living God."
	> “Peter explained that he had been, at sundry times and by various persons, compared with Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. When Jesus had listened to this report, he drew himself upon his feet, and looking down upon the twelve sitting about him in a semicircle, with startling emphasis he pointed to them with a sweeping gesture of his hand and asked, ‘But who say you that I am?’ There was a moment of tense silence. The twelve never took their eyes off the Master, and then Simon Peter, springing to his feet, exclaimed: ‘You are the Deliverer, the Son of the living God.’ And the eleven sitting apostles arose to their feet with one accord, thereby indicating that Peter had spoken for all of them.” [UB 157:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_5)

3. **Proposition.** Replying to Peter, Jesus said: ”This has been revealed to you by my Father."
	> “When Jesus had beckoned them again to be seated, and while still standing before them, he said: ‘This has been revealed to you by my Father. The hour has come when you should know the truth about me. But for the time being I charge you that you tell this to no man. Let us go hence.’” [UB 157:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_6)

4. **Proposition**. Jesus declared that he would build the Father's kingdom upon this rock of spiritual reality.
	> “Jesus, still standing, then said to the twelve: ‘You are my chosen ambassadors, but I know that, in the circumstances, you could not entertain this belief as a result of mere human knowledge. This is a revelation of the spirit of my Father to your inmost souls. And when, therefore, you make this confession by the insight of the spirit of my Father which dwells within you, I am led to declare that upon this foundation will I build the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven. Upon this rock of spiritual reality will I build the living temple of spiritual fellowship in the eternal realities of my Father's kingdom. All the forces of evil and the hosts of sin shall not prevail against this human fraternity of the divine spirit.’” [UB 157:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_5)

5. **Proposition.** Jesus delivered the keys of the outward kingdom - authority over things temporal - to his human associates.
	> “And while my Father's spirit shall ever be the divine guide and mentor of all who enter the bonds of this spirit fellowship, to you and your successors I now deliver the keys of the outward kingdom — the authority over things temporal — the social and economic features of this association of men and women as fellows of the kingdom. And again he charged them, for the time being, that they should tell no man that he was the Son of God.” [UB 157:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_5)

6. **Proposition.** Ever since that day Jesus has been building the living temple upon that eternal foundation of divine sonship.
	> “And ever since that day this same Jesus has been building that living temple upon that same eternal foundation of his divine sonship, and those who thereby become self-conscious sons of God are the human stones which constitute this living temple of sonship erecting to the glory and honor of the wisdom and love of the eternal Father of spirits.” [UB 157:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_7)

7. **Proposition.** The new and vital feature of Peter's confession was the clear-cut recognition of Jesus' divinity. The second confession revealed his combined human and divine natures - and upon that truth he would establish the kingdom.
	> “The new and vital feature of Peter's confession was the clear-cut recognition that Jesus was the Son of God, of his unquestioned divinity. Ever since his baptism and the wedding at Cana these apostles had variously regarded him as the Messiah, but it was not a part of the Jewish concept of the national deliverer that he should be _divine_. The Jews had not taught that the Messiah would spring from divinity; he was to be the ”anointed one,“ but hardly had they contemplated him as being ”the Son of God.“ In the second confession more emphasis was placed upon the _combined nature_, the supernal fact that he was the Son of Man _and_ the Son of God, and it was upon this great truth of the union of the human nature with the divine nature that Jesus declared he would build the kingdom of heaven.” [UB 157:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_1)

8. **Proposition**. For three years Jesus had proclaimed himself the ”Son of Man.” His apostles had insisted he was the Messiah. Now he revealed that he is the Son of God.
	> “For three years Jesus had been proclaiming that he was the ”Son of Man,“ while for these same three years the apostles had been increasingly insistent that he was the expected Jewish Messiah. He now disclosed that he was the Son of God, and upon the concept of the _combined nature_ of the Son of Man and the Son of God, he determined to build the kingdom of heaven. He had decided to refrain from further efforts to convince them that he was not the Messiah. He now proposed boldly to reveal to them what he _is_, and then to ignore their determination to persist in regarding him as the Messiah.” [UB 157:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_3)

9. **Proposition.** Jesus now entered upon the fourth and last stage of his bestowal.
	> “Jesus now entered upon the fourth and last stage of his human life in the flesh. The first stage was that of his childhood, the years when he was only dimly conscious of his origin, nature, and destiny as a human being. The second stage was the increasingly self-conscious years of youth and advancing manhood, during which he came more clearly to comprehend his divine nature and human mission. This second stage ended with the experiences and revelations associated with his baptism. The third stage of the Master's earth experience extended from the baptism through the years of his ministry as teacher and healer and up to this momentous hour of Peter's confession at Caesarea-Philippi. This third period of his earth life embraced the times when his apostles and his immediate followers knew him as the Son of Man and regarded him as the Messiah. The fourth and last period of his earth career began here at Caesarea-Philippi and extended on to the crucifixion. This stage of his ministry was characterized by his acknowledgment of divinity and embraced the labors of his last year in the flesh. During the fourth period, while the majority of his followers still regarded him as the Messiah, he became known to the apostles as the Son of God. Peter's confession marked the beginning of the new period of the more complete realization of the truth of his supreme ministry as a bestowal Son on Urantia and for an entire universe, and the recognition of that fact, at least hazily, by his chosen ambassadors.” [UB 157:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p6_3)

10. **Proposition.** Jesus disclaimed being the Messiah and foretold his death and resurrection, while Peter contended with him.
	> “In answer to Andrew, Jesus said: ‘My brethren, it is because you have confessed that I am the Son of God that I am constrained to begin to unfold to you the truth about the end of the bestowal of the Son of Man on earth. You insist on clinging to the belief that I am the Messiah, and you will not abandon the idea that the Messiah must sit upon a throne in Jerusalem; wherefore do I persist in telling you that the Son of Man must presently go to Jerusalem, suffer many things, be rejected by the scribes, the elders, and the chief priests, and after all this be killed and raised from the dead. And I speak not a parable to you; I speak the truth to you that you may be prepared for these events when they suddenly come upon us.’ And while he was yet speaking, Simon Peter, rushing impetuously toward him, laid his hand upon the Master's shoulder and said: ‘Master, be it far from us to contend with you, but I declare that these things shall never happen to you.’” [UB 158:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p7_3)

11. **Proposition**. Jesus rebuked Peter's well-meant affection because it was blind to the Father's will.
	> “Peter spoke thus because he loved Jesus; but the Master's human nature recognized in these words of well-meant affection the subtle suggestion of temptation that he change his policy of pursuing to the end his earth bestowal in accordance with the will of his Paradise Father. And it was because he detected the danger of permitting the suggestions of even his affectionate and loyal friends to dissuade him, that he turned upon Peter and the other apostles, saying: ‘Get you behind me. You savor of the spirit of the adversary, the tempter. When you talk in this manner, you are not on my side but rather on the side of our enemy. In this way do you make your love for me a stumbling block to my doing the Father's will. Mind not the ways of men but rather the will of God.’” [UB 158:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p7_4)

## XXII. THE TRANSFIGURATION

1. **Proposition**. Jesus prepared to begin his fourth and final phase of bestowal on the mount of transfiguration.
	> “And now Jesus would take his apostles along with him to Mount Hermon, where he had appointed to inaugurate his fourth phase of earth ministry as the Son of God. Some of them were present at his baptism in the Jordan and had witnessed the beginning of his career as the Son of Man, and he desired that some of them should also be present to hear his authority for the assumption of the new and public role of a Son of God. Accordingly, on the morning of Friday, August 12, Jesus said to the twelve: ‘Lay in provisions and prepare yourselves for a journey to yonder mountain, where the spirit bids me go to be endowed for the finish of my work on earth. And I would take my brethren along that they may also be strengthened for the trying times of going with me through this experience.’” [UB 157:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_5)

2. **Proposition.** By special arrangement the three apostles observed Jesus conferring with Gabriel and the Father Melchizedek.
	> “When the three had been fast asleep for about half an hour, they were suddenly awakened by a near-by crackling sound, and much to their amazement and consternation, on looking about them, they beheld Jesus in intimate converse with two brilliant beings clothed in the habiliments of the light of the celestial world. And Jesus' face and form shone with the luminosity of a heavenly light. These three conversed in a strange language, but from certain things said, Peter erroneously conjectured that the beings with Jesus were Moses and Elijah; in reality, they were Gabriel and the Father Melchizedek. The physical controllers had arranged for the apostles to witness this scene because of Jesus' request.” [UB 158:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_8)

3. **Proposition.** The bewildered Peter proposed to put up three tents - one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
	> “The three apostles were so badly frightened that they were slow in collecting their wits, but Peter, who was first to recover himself, said, as the dazzling vision faded from before them and they observed Jesus standing alone: ”Jesus, Master, it is good to have been here. We rejoice to see this glory. We are loath to go back down to the inglorious world. If you are willing, let us abide here, and we will erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.“ And Peter said this because of his confusion, and because nothing else came into his mind at just that moment.” [UB 158:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_9)

4. **Proposition.** Enshrouded by a silvery cloud, the frightened apostles heard a voice say: “This is my beloved Son; give heed to him.”
	> “While Peter was yet speaking, a silvery cloud drew near and overshadowed the four of them. The apostles now became greatly frightened, and as they fell down on their faces to worship, they heard a voice, the same that had spoken on the occasion of Jesus' baptism, say: ‘This is my beloved Son; give heed to him.’ And when the cloud vanished, again was Jesus alone with the three, and he reached down and touched them, saying: ‘Arise and be not afraid; you shall see greater things than this.’ But the apostles were truly afraid; they were a silent and thoughtful trio as they made ready to descend the mountain shortly before midnight.” [UB 158:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_10)

5. **Proposition**. The transfiguration was the occasion of a double transaction.
	> “That which Peter, James, and John witnessed on the mount of transfiguration was a fleeting glimpse of a celestial pageant which transpired that eventful day on Mount Hermon. The transfiguration was the occasion of:
	> 
	> 1. The acceptance of the fullness of the bestowal of the incarnated life of Michael on Urantia by the Eternal Mother-Son of Paradise. As far as concerned the requirements of the Eternal Son, Jesus had now received assurance of their fulfillment. And Gabriel brought Jesus that assurance.
	> 
	> 2. The testimony of the satisfaction of the Infinite Spirit as to the fullness of the Urantia bestowal in the likeness of mortal flesh. The universe representative of the Infinite Spirit, the immediate associate of Michael on Salvington and his ever-present coworker, on this occasion spoke through the Father Melchizedek."[UB 158:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p3_1)

## XXIII. REVELATION OF THE FATHER

1. **Proposition.** Jesus was dedicated to revealing the Paradise Father and consecrated to living his divine will.
	> “In all your efforts to decipher the meaning of Jesus' life on Urantia, you must be mindful of the motivation of the Michael bestowal. If you would comprehend the meaning of many of his apparently strange doings, you must discern the purpose of his sojourn on your world. He was consistently careful not to build up an overattractive and attention-consuming personal career. He wanted to make no unusual or overpowering appeals to his fellow men. He was dedicated to the work of revealing the heavenly Father to his fellow mortals and at the same time was consecrated to the sublime task of living his mortal earth life all the while subject to the will of the same Paradise Father.”In all your efforts to decipher the meaning of Jesus' life on Urantia, you must be mindful of the motivation of the Michael bestowal. If you would comprehend the meaning of many of his apparently strange doings, you must discern the purpose of his sojourn on your world. He was consistently careful not to build up an overattractive and attention-consuming personal career. He wanted to make no unusual or overpowering appeals to his fellow men. He was dedicated to the work of revealing the heavenly Father to his fellow mortals and at the same time was consecrated to the sublime task of living his mortal earth life all the while subject to the will of the same Paradise Father.” [UB 129:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_5)

2. **Proposition.** When confronted with the occasion of an en masse healing - Jesus deferred to the Father's will.
	> “When Peter implored the Master to heed their cry for help, Jesus, looking down upon the afflicted throng, answered: ‘I have come into the world to reveal the Father and establish his kingdom. For this purpose have I lived my life to this hour. If, therefore, it should be the will of Him who sent me and not inconsistent with my dedication to the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, I would desire to see my children made whole — and — ’ but the further words of Jesus were lost in the tumult.” [UB 145:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_9)

3. **Proposition**. As the Father's will interposed no objection - the 683 mortals were healed.
	> “Jesus had passed the responsibility of this healing decision to the ruling of his Father. Evidently the Father's will interposed no objection, for the words of the Master had scarcely been uttered when the assembly of celestial personalities serving under the command of Jesus' Personalized Thought Adjuster was mightily astir. The vast retinue descended into the midst of this motley throng of afflicted mortals, and in a moment of time 683 men, women, and children were made whole, were perfectly healed of all their physical diseases and other material disorders. Such a scene was never witnessed on earth before that day, nor since. And for those of us who were present to behold this creative wave of healing, it was indeed a thrilling spectacle.” [UB 145:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_10)

4. **Proposition.** The revelation of God to the world, through Jesus, shall not fail.
	> “Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.” [UB 196:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_3)

## THE BIBLE: JESUS' LOVE

> “But I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.”But I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.” [John 14:31](/en/Bible/John/14#v31)
> 
> “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.” [John 15:9](/en/Bible/John/15#v9)
> 
> “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” [Luke 19:10](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v10)
> 
> “So the Jews said, ‘See how he loved him.’” [John 11:36](/en/Bible/John/11#v36)
> 
> “And as he landed he saw a great throng. and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd.” [Mark 6:34](/en/Bible/Mark/6#v34)

## XXIV. JESUS' HUMAN NATURE

1. **Proposition**. Jesus was sincere, genuine, and free from affectation. He lived the truth.
	> “The unfailing kindness of Jesus touched the hearts of men, but his stalwart strength of character amazed his followers. He was truly sincere; there was nothing of the hypocrite in him. He was free from affectation; he was always so refreshingly genuine. He never stooped to pretense, and he never resorted to shamming. He lived the truth, even as he taught it. He was the truth. He was constrained to proclaim saving truth to his generation, even though such sincerity sometimes caused pain. He was unquestioningly loyal to all truth.””The unfailing kindness of Jesus touched the hearts of men, but his stalwart strength of character amazed his followers. He was truly sincere; there was nothing of the hypocrite in him. He was free from affectation; he was always so refreshingly genuine. He never stooped to pretense, and he never resorted to shamming. He lived the truth, even as he taught it. He was the truth. He was constrained to proclaim saving truth to his generation, even though such sincerity sometimes caused pain. He was unquestioningly loyal to all truth.” [UB 100:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_2)

2. **Proposition**. He was free from all freakish, erratic, and eccentric tendencies. He was never capricious, whimsical, or hysterical.
	> “But the Master was so reasonable, so approachable. He was so practical in all his ministry, while all his plans were characterized by such sanctified common sense. He was so free from all freakish, erratic, and eccentric tendencies. He was never capricious, whimsical, or hysterical. In all his teaching and in everything he did there was always an exquisite discrimination associated with an extraordinary sense of propriety.” [UB 100:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_3)

3. **Proposition.** Jesus was emotionally well-balanced. He was so well-poised because he was so perfectly unified.
	> “The Son of Man was always a well-poised personality. Even his enemies maintained a wholesome respect for him; they even feared his presence. Jesus was unafraid. He was surcharged with divine enthusiasm, but he never became fanatical. He was emotionally active but never flighty. He was imaginative but always practical. He frankly faced the realities of life, but he was never dull or prosaic. He was courageous but never reckless; prudent but never cowardly. He was sympathetic but not sentimental; unique but not eccentric. He was pious but not sanctimonious. And he was so well-poised because he was so perfectly unified.” [UB 100:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_4)

4. **Proposition.** He was a cheerful person. He unswervingly trusted God and was touchingly considerate of men.
	> “Jesus was an unusually cheerful person, but he was not a blind and unreasoning optimist. His constant word of exhortation was, ‘Be of good cheer.’ He could maintain this confident attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and his unshakable confidence in man. He was always touchingly considerate of all men because he loved them and believed in them. Still he was always true to his convictions and magnificently firm in his devotion to the doing of his Father's will.” [UB 100:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_9)

5. **Proposition.** Jesus was generous but never wasteful; he taught: “Freely you have received, freely give.”
	> “The Master was always generous. He never grew weary of saying, ”It is more blessed to give than to receive.“ Said he, ‘Freely you have received, freely give.’ And yet, with all of his unbounded generosity, he was never wasteful or extravagant. He taught that you must believe to receive salvation. ‘For every one who seeks shall receive.’” [UB 100:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_10)

6. **Proposition.** He was candid and frank, but always friendly and fair.
	> “He was candid, but always kind. Said he, ‘If it were not so, I would have told you.’ He was frank, but always friendly. He was outspoken in his love for the sinner and in his hatred for sin. But throughout all this amazing frankness he was unerringly fair.” [UB 100:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_11)

7. **Proposition.** He was filled with enthusiasm for the gospel, and this controlled enthusiasm was contagious.
	> “Jesus was consistently cheerful, notwithstanding he sometimes drank deeply of the cup of human sorrow. He fearlessly faced the realities of existence, yet was he filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom. But he controlled his enthusiasm; it never controlled him. He was unreservedly dedicated to ‘the Father's business.’ This divine enthusiasm led his unspiritual brethren to think he was beside himself, but the onlooking universe appraised him as the model of sanity and the pattern of supreme mortal devotion to the high standards of spiritual living. And his controlled enthusiasm was contagious; his associates were constrained to share his divine optimism.” [UB 100:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_12)

8. **Proposition.** He was not a man of sorrows, he was the soul of gladness.
	> “This man of Galilee was not a man of sorrows; he was a soul of gladness. Always was he saying, ‘Rejoice and be exceedingly glad.’ But when duty required, he was willing to walk courageously through the ‘valley of the shadow of death.’ He was gladsome but at the same time humble.” [UB 100:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_13)

9. **Proposition.** His courage was equaled only by his patience. His indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.
	> “His courage was equaled only by his patience. When pressed to act prematurely, he would only reply, ‘My hour has not yet come.’ He was never in a hurry; his composure was sublime. But he was often indignant at evil, intolerant of sin. He was often mightily moved to resist that which was inimical to the welfare of his children on earth. But his indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.” [UB 100:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_14)

10. **Proposition.** His courage was always linked with discretion and controlled by reason. His watchword was ”Fear not."
	> “His courage was magnificent, but he was never foolhardy. His watchword was, ‘Fear not.’ His bravery was lofty and his courage often heroic. But his courage was linked with discretion and controlled by reason. It was courage born of faith, not the recklessness of blind presumption. He was truly brave but never audacious.” [UB 100:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_15)

11. **Proposition.** Jesus had great capacity for humor and play. He had difficulty with Sabbath restrictions on play.
	> “It was always difficult for Jesus to comprehend the harm of certain sorts of play which were forbidden on the Sabbath, but he never failed to conform to his parents' wishes. He had a capacity for humor and play which was afforded little opportunity for expression in the environment of his day and generation, but up to the age of fourteen he was cheerful and lighthearted most of the time.” [UB 123:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_3)

12. **Proposition.** "...it behooved him in every respect to be made like his brethren that he might become a merciful and understanding sovereign ruler over them.”
	> “He lived his mortal life just as all others of the human family may live theirs, ‘who in the days of the flesh so frequently offered up prayers and supplications, even with strong feelings and tears, to Him who is able to save from all evil, and his prayers were effective because he believed.’ Wherefore it behooved him _in every respect_ to be made like his brethren that he might become a merciful and understanding sovereign ruler over them.” [UB 128:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_7)

13. **Proposition.** Jesus did not want to be venerated as a person to the neglect of his teaching. He wanted to prevent the formulation of a religion about him.
	> “One purpose which Jesus had in mind, when he sought to segregate certain features of his earthly experience, was to prevent the building up of such a versatile and spectacular career as would cause subsequent generations to venerate the teacher in place of obeying the truth which he had lived and taught. Jesus did not want to build up such a human record of achievement as would attract attention from his teaching. Very early he recognized that his followers would be tempted to formulate a religion about him which might become a competitor of the gospel of the kingdom that he intended to proclaim to the world. Accordingly, he consistently sought to suppress everything during his eventful career which he thought might be made to serve this natural human tendency to exalt the teacher in place of proclaiming his teachings.” [UB 128:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_6)

14. **Proposition.** Jesus is the new and living way from man to God.
	> “And this was his true and supreme purpose. He did not come down to live on Urantia as the perfect and detailed example for any child or adult, any man or woman, in that age or any other. True it is, indeed, that in his full, rich, beautiful, and noble life we may all find much that is exquisitely exemplary, divinely inspiring, but this is because he lived a true and genuinely human life. Jesus did not live his life on earth in order to set an example for all other human beings to copy. He lived this life in the flesh by the same mercy ministry that you all may live your lives on earth; and as he lived his mortal life in his day and _as he was_, so did he thereby set the example for all of us thus to live our lives in our day and _as we are_. You may not aspire to live his life, but you can resolve to _live your lives_ even as, and by the same means that, he lived his. Jesus may not be the technical and detailed example for all the mortals of all ages on all the realms of this local universe, but he is everlastingly the inspiration and guide of all Paradise pilgrims from the worlds of initial ascension up through a universe of universes and on through Havona to Paradise. Jesus is the _new and living way_ from man to God, from the partial to the perfect, from the earthly to the heavenly, from time to eternity.” [UB 129:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_7)

15. **Proposition.** He lived the mortal life from the bottom to the top; from the beginning to the end.
	> “The Son of Man experienced those wide ranges of human emotion which reach from superb joy to profound sorrow. He was a child of joy and a being of rare good humor; likewise was he a ‘man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.’ In a spiritual sense, he did live through the mortal life from the bottom to the top, from the beginning to the end. From a material point of view, he might appear to have escaped living through both social extremes of human existence, but intellectually he became wholly familiar with the entire and complete experience of humankind.” [UB 129:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_4)

16. **Proposition.** He experienced the full life of mortal man, not only as lived on Urantia, but also as lived on all the evolutionary worlds.
	> “Jesus knows about the thoughts and feelings, the urges and impulses, of the evolutionary and ascendant mortals of the realms, from birth to death. He has lived the human life from the beginnings of physical, intellectual, and spiritual selfhood up through infancy, childhood, youth, and adulthood — even to the human experience of death. He not only passed through these usual and familiar human periods of intellectual and spiritual advancement, but he _also_ fully experienced those higher and more advanced phases of human and Adjuster reconciliation which so few Urantia mortals ever attain. And thus he experienced the full life of mortal man, not only as it is lived on your world, but also as it is lived on all other evolutionary worlds of time and space, even on the highest and most advanced of all the worlds settled in light and life.” [UB 129:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_5)

17. **Proposition.** Before he was thirty years old, he became the fullness of man awaiting to become manifest to God.
	> “By the end of the twenty-ninth year Jesus of Nazareth had virtually finished the living of the life required of mortals as sojourners in the flesh. He came on earth the fullness of God to be manifest to man; he had now become well-nigh the perfection of man awaiting the occasion to become manifest to God. And he did all of this before he was thirty years of age.” [UB 129:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_8)

18. **Proposition.** He prayed for assurance that his death, even as his life, would please his Father.
	> “And when he had fallen down on his face, he prayed: ‘My Father, I came into this world to do your will, and so have I. I know that the hour has come to lay down this life in the flesh, and I do not shrink therefrom, but I would know that it is your will that I drink this cup. Send me the assurance that I will please you in my death even as I have in my life.’” And when he had fallen down on his face, he prayed: ‘My Father, I came into this world to do your will, and so have I. I know that the hour has come to lay down this life in the flesh, and I do not shrink therefrom, but I would know that it is your will that I drink this cup. Send me the assurance that I will please you in my death even as I have in my life.’" [UB 182:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_1)

19. **Proposition**. His humiliation and death were the great proofs of his humanity.
	> “During the years that Jesus lived among his followers, they did, indeed, have much proof of his divine nature, but just now are they about to witness new evidences of his humanity. Just before the greatest of all the revelations of his divinity, his resurrection, must now come the greatest proofs of his mortal nature, his humiliation and crucifixion.” [UB 182:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_5)

20. **Proposition**. By prayer, his humanity laid a firmer faith-hold upon his divinity.
	> “Each time he prayed in the garden, his humanity laid a firmer faith-hold upon his divinity; his human will more completely became one with the divine will of his Father. Among other words spoken to him by the mighty angel was the message that the Father desired his Son to finish his earth bestowal by passing through the creature experience of death just as all mortal creatures must experience material dissolution in passing from the existence of time into the progression of eternity.” [UB 182:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_6)

21. **Proposition.** He was not insensible to emotional situations and he was comforted by memories of sunrise and sunset on the Sea of Galilee.
	> “Jesus' humanity was not insensible to this situation of private loneliness, public shame, and the appearance of the failure of his cause. All these sentiments bore down on him with indescribable heaviness. In this great sorrow his mind went back to the days of his childhood in Nazareth and to his early work in Galilee. At the time of this great trial there came up in his mind many of those pleasant scenes of his earthly ministry. And it was from these old memories of Nazareth, Capernaum, Mount Hermon, and of the sunrise and sunset on the shimmering Sea of Galilee, that he soothed himself as he made his human heart strong and ready to encounter the traitor who should so soon betray him.” [UB 182:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p3_10)

22. **Proposition**. Jesus may be regarded as a valiant and courageous hero.
	> “It is most unfortunate that those who have come to venerate the divine and risen Christ should have overlooked the man — the valiant and courageous hero — Joshua ben Joseph.” [UB 92:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p7_12)

23. **Proposition.** You must not take the human Jesus away from men.
	> “Jesus' devotion to the Father's will and the service of man was even more than mortal decision and human determination; it was a wholehearted consecration of himself to such an unreserved bestowal of love. No matter how great the fact of the sovereignty of Michael, you must not take the human Jesus away from men. The Master has ascended on high as a man, as well as God; he belongs to men; men belong to him. How unfortunate that religion itself should be so misinterpreted as to take the human Jesus away from struggling mortals! Let not the discussions of the humanity or the divinity of the Christ obscure the saving truth that Jesus of Nazareth was a religious man who, by faith, achieved the knowing and the doing of the will of God; he was the most truly religious man who has ever lived on Urantia.” [UB 196:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_1)

## XXV. JESUS' DIVINE NATURE

1. **Proposition.** The babe, the lad, the youth, the man of Nazareth, was the incarnated Creator of a universe.
	> “Between these two celestial visitations, one in his thirteenth year and the other at his baptism, there occurred nothing supernatural or superhuman in the life of this incarnated Creator Son. Notwithstanding this, the babe of Bethlehem, the lad, youth, and man of Nazareth, was in reality the incarnated Creator of a universe; but he never once used aught of this power, nor did he utilize the guidance of celestial personalities, aside from that of his guardian seraphim, in the living of his human life up to the day of his baptism by John. And we who thus testify know whereof we speak.”Between these two celestial visitations, one in his thirteenth year and the other at his baptism, there occurred nothing supernatural or superhuman in the life of this incarnated Creator Son. Notwithstanding this, the babe of Bethlehem, the lad, youth, and man of Nazareth, was in reality the incarnated Creator of a universe; but he never once used aught of this power, nor did he utilize the guidance of celestial personalities, aside from that of his guardian seraphim, in the living of his human life up to the day of his baptism by John. And we who thus testify know whereof we speak.” [UB 128:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_9)

2. **Proposition.** He declared: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end...” He was called the Lord our God and the Captain of our salvation.
	> “And yet, throughout all these years of his life in the flesh he was truly divine. He was actually a Creator Son of the Paradise Father. When once he had espoused his public career, subsequent to the technical completion of his purely mortal experience of sovereignty acquirement, he did not hesitate publicly to admit that he was the Son of God. He did not hesitate to declare, ”I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.“ He made no protest in later years when he was called Lord of Glory, Ruler of a Universe, the Lord God of all creation, the Holy One of Israel, the Lord of all, our Lord and our God, God with us, having a name above every name and on all worlds, the Omnipotence of a universe, the Universe Mind of this creation, the One in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge, the fullness of Him who fills all things, the eternal Word of the eternal God, the One who was before all things and in whom all things consist, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Upholder of a universe, the Judge of all the earth, the Giver of life eternal, the True Shepherd, the Deliverer of the worlds, and the Captain of our salvation.” [UB 128:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_10)

3. **Proposition.** Even while he wrestled with poverty, there was a growing awareness that he was a Son of God. After his baptism his followers worshiped him.
	> “After his baptism he thought nothing of permitting his sincere believers and grateful followers to worship him. Even while he wrestled with poverty and toiled with his hands to provide the necessities of life for his family, his awareness that he was a Son of God was growing; he knew that he was the maker of the heavens and this very earth whereon he was now living out his human existence. And the hosts of celestial beings throughout the great and onlooking universe likewise knew that this man of Nazareth was their beloved Sovereign and Creator-father. A profound suspense pervaded the universe of Nebadon throughout these years; all celestial eyes were continuously focused on Urantia — on Palestine.” [UB 128:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_13)

4. **Proposition.** This incarnated Son came from the Father and lived with man.
	> “Jesus is a divine Son, one in the Universal Father's full confidence. He had been with the Father and comprehended him fully. He had now lived his earth life to the full satisfaction of the Father, and this incarnation in the flesh had enabled him fully to comprehend man. Jesus was the perfection of man; he had attained just such perfection as all true believers are destined to attain in him and through him. Jesus revealed a God of perfection to man and presented in himself the perfected son of the realms to God.” [UB 142:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_15)

5. **Proposition**. Nalda talked of the Deliverer, and Jesus said: "I who speak to you am he.”
	> “But Nalda would make one more effort to avoid the discussion of the embarrassing question of her personal life on earth and the status of her soul before God. Once more she resorted to questions of general religion, saying: ‘Yes, I know, Sir, that John has preached about the coming of the Converter, he who will be called the Deliverer, and that, when he shall come, he will declare to us all things’ — and Jesus, interrupting Nalda, said with startling assurance, ‘I who speak to you am he.’” [UB 143:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p5_7)

6. **Proposition.** Nathaniel and Thomas presented to Rodan nine propositions as proving the divinity of Jesus. See" [UB 161:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p2_1)

7. **Proposition**. When Josiah asked about the Son of God, Jesus said: “You have both seen and heard him, and it is he who now speaks to you.”
	> “Jesus and the two apostles did not go in search of Josiah at his home until they heard he had been cast out of the synagogue. When they came to his house, Thomas called him out in the yard, and Jesus, speaking to him, said: ”Josiah, do you believe in the Son of God?“ And Josiah answered, ”Tell me who he is that I may believe in him.“ And Jesus said: ”You have both seen and heard him, and it is he who now speaks to you.“ And Josiah said, ”Lord, I believe,“ and falling down, he worshiped.” [UB 164:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p5_4)

8. **Proposition.** The Master was known by sixteen names, all indicative of his divinity.
	> “The Master, during the course of this final prayer with his apostles, alluded to the fact that he had manifested the Father's _name_ to the world. And that is truly what he did by the revelation of God through his perfected life in the flesh. The Father in heaven had sought to reveal himself to Moses, but he could proceed no further than to cause it to be said, ‘I AM.’ And when pressed for further revelation of himself, it was only disclosed, ‘I AM that I AM.’ But when Jesus had finished his earth life, this name of the Father had been so revealed that the Master, who was the Father incarnate, could truly say:
	> 
	> I am the bread of life
	> I am the living water.
	> I am the light of the world.
	> I am the desire of all ages.
	> I am the open door to eternal salvation.
	> I am the reality of endless life.
	> I am the good shepherd.
	> I am the pathway of infinite perfection.
	> I am the resurrection and the life.
	> I am the secret of eternal survival.
	> I am the way, the truth, and the life.
	> I am the infinite Father of my finite children.
	> I am the true vine; you are the branches.
	> I am the hope of all who know the living truth.
	> I am the living bridge from one world to another.
	> I am the living link between time and eternity.” [UB 182:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_9)

### THE BIBLE

> In the New Testament Jesus is called the Son of God forty times beside numerous mentions of ”my Son“ and ”his Son."
> 
> “And they all said, ‘Are you the Son of God, then?’ And he said to them, ‘You say that I am.’” [Luke 22:70](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v70)
> 
> He is called Lord several hundred times: “And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.” [Phil 2:11](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v11)
> 
> Jesus is repeatedly called God: “Who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.” [Phil 2:6](/en/Bible/Philippians/2#v6)
> 
> Altogether, Jesus is referred to by sixteen names——all inferring Deity.

> 
> “Who will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power which enables him even to subject all things to himself.” [Phil 3:21](/en/Bible/Philippians/3#v21)

## XXVI. THE LAST SUPPER

1. **Proposition**. The old “cup of blessing,” Jesus renamed the “cup of remembrance.”
	> “As they brought Jesus the third cup of wine, the ‘cup of blessing,’ he arose from the couch and, taking the cup in his hands, blessed it, saying: ‘Take this cup, all of you, and drink of it. This shall be the cup of my remembrance. This is the cup of the blessing of a new dispensation of grace and truth. This shall be to you the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth. And I will not again drink this cup with you until I drink in new form with you in the Father's eternal kingdom.’” [UB 179:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_1)

2. **Proposition**. The “bread of remembrance” is the symbol of the united life of the Father and the Son-—the word of truth incarnated in the flesh.
	> “When they had finished drinking this new cup of remembrance, the Master took up the bread and, after giving thanks, broke it in pieces and, directing them to pass it around, said: ‘Take this bread of remembrance and eat it. I have told you that I am the bread of life. And this bread of life is the united life of the Father and the Son in one gift. The word of the Father, as revealed in the Son, is indeed the bread of life.’ When they had partaken of the bread of remembrance, the symbol of the living word of truth incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, they all sat down.” [UB 179:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_3)

3. **Proposition**. In establishing the remembrance supper Jesus sought to avoid being dogmatic. He rather wanted to set man's reborn soul free upon the joyous wings of a new and living spiritual liberty.
	> “In instituting this remembrance supper, the Master, as was always his habit, resorted to parables and symbols. He employed symbols because he wanted to teach certain great spiritual truths in such a manner as to make it difficult for his successors to attach precise interpretations and definite meanings to his words. In this way he sought to prevent successive generations from crystallizing his teaching and binding down his spiritual meanings by the dead chains of tradition and dogma. In the establishment of the only ceremony or sacrament associated with his whole life mission, Jesus took great pains to _suggest_ his meanings rather than to commit himself to precise _definitions._ He did not wish to destroy the individual's concept of divine communion by establishing a precise form; neither did he desire to limit the believer's spiritual imagination by formally cramping it. He rather sought to set man's reborn soul free upon the joyous wings of a new and living spiritual liberty.” [UB 179:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_4)

4. **Proposition.** Believers of the intervening centuries failed to follow his leading. Of all Jesus' teachings none has become more tradition-standardized.
	> “Notwithstanding the Master's effort thus to establish this new sacrament of the remembrance, those who followed after him in the intervening centuries saw to it that his express desire was effectively thwarted in that his simple spiritual symbolism of that last night in the flesh has been reduced to precise interpretations and subjected to the almost mathematical precision of a set formula. Of all Jesus' teachings none have become more tradition-standardized.” [UB 179:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_5)

## XXVII. THE CRUCIFIXION

1. **Proposition**. It was man, not God, who planned and executed the death of Jesus on the cross.
	> “It was man and not God who planned and executed the death of Jesus on the cross. True, the Father refused to interfere with the march of human events on Urantia, but the Father in Paradise did not decree, demand, or require the death of his Son as it was carried out on earth. It is a fact that in some manner, sooner or later, Jesus would have had to divest himself of his mortal body, his incarnation in the flesh, but he could have executed such a task in countless ways without dying on a cross between two thieves. All of this was man's doing, not God's.” [UB 186:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_2)

2. **Proposition.** The good news that man is a faith-son of God, is not dependent on the death of Jesus.
	> “The gospel of the good news that mortal man may, by faith, become spirit-conscious that he is a son of God, is not dependent on the death of Jesus. True, indeed, all this gospel of the kingdom has been tremendously illuminated by the Master's death, but even more so by his life.” [UB 186:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_4)

3. **Proposition.** Of his own free will Jesus submitted to mortal death on the cross.
	> “What Jesus is now about to do, submit to death on the cross, he does of his own free will. In foretelling this experience, he said: ‘The Father loves and sustains me because I am willing to lay down my life. But I will take it up again. No one takes my life away from me — I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up. I have received such a commandment from my Father.’” [UB 187:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p0_3)

4. **Proposition.** While Jesus did not die as the atonement for man's supposed racial guilt, there is significance attached to the cross. Urantia is known as the “World of the Cross.”
	> “Although Jesus did not die this death on the cross to atone for the racial guilt of mortal man nor to provide some sort of effective approach to an otherwise offended and unforgiving God; even though the Son of Man did not offer himself as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of God and to open the way for sinful man to obtain salvation; notwithstanding that these ideas of atonement and propitiation are erroneous, nonetheless, there are significances attached to this death of Jesus on the cross which should not be overlooked. It is a fact that Urantia has become known among other neighboring inhabited planets as the ‘World of the Cross.’” [UB 188:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_1)

5. **Proposition.** Death is a part of the full mortal life which Jesus desired to live.
	> “Jesus desired to live a full mortal life in the flesh on Urantia. Death is, ordinarily, a part of life. Death is the last act in the mortal drama. In your well-meant efforts to escape the superstitious errors of the false interpretation of the meaning of the death on the cross, you should be careful not to make the great mistake of failing to perceive the true significance and the genuine import of the Master's death.” [UB 188:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_2)

6. **Proposition.** God does not damn man because of the sins of his ancestors. Jesus did not die to ransom man from Satan.
	> “Mortal man was never the property of the archdeceivers. Jesus did not die to ransom man from the clutch of the apostate rulers and fallen princes of the spheres. The Father in heaven never conceived of such crass injustice as damning a mortal soul because of the evildoing of his ancestors. Neither was the Master's death on the cross a sacrifice which consisted in an effort to pay God a debt which the race of mankind had come to owe him.” [UB 188:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_3)

7. **Proposition.** Moses taught the justice of a Creator God; Jesus portrayed the love and mercy of a heavenly Father.
	> “Before Jesus lived on earth, you might possibly have been justified in believing in such a God, but not since the Master lived and died among your fellow mortals. Moses taught the dignity and justice of a Creator God; but Jesus portrayed the love and mercy of a heavenly Father.” [UB 188:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_4)

8. **Proposition.** Jesus lived and died for a whole universe - illuminating the way of salvation for all.
	> “Jesus lived and died for a whole universe, not just for the races of this one world. While the mortals of the realms had salvation even before Jesus lived and died on Urantia, it is nevertheless a fact that his bestowal on this world greatly illuminated the way of salvation; his death did much to make forever plain the certainty of mortal survival after death in the flesh.” [UB 188:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_6)

9. **Proposition.** While it is hardly proper to regard Jesus as a redeemer, it is wholly correct to call him a savior.
	> “Though it is hardly proper to speak of Jesus as a sacrificer, a ransomer, or a redeemer, it is wholly correct to refer to him as a _savior_. He forever made the way of salvation (survival) more clear and certain; he did better and more surely show the way of salvation for all the mortals of all the worlds of the universe of Nebadon.” [UB 188:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_7)

10. **Proposition.** The important thing about the death of Jesus is not the fact, but the superb manner in which he met death.
	> “The great thing about the death of Jesus, as it is related to the enrichment of human experience and the enlargement of the way of salvation, is not the _fact_ of his death but rather the superb manner and the matchless spirit in which he met death.” [UB 188:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_12)

11. **Proposition.** The cross was a supreme expression of love - a completed revelation of mercy.
	> “The sufferings of Jesus were not confined to the crucifixion. In reality, Jesus of Nazareth spent upward of twenty-five years on the cross of a real and intense mortal existence. The real value of the cross consists in the fact that it was the supreme and final expression of his love, the completed revelation of his mercy.” [UB 188:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_4)

12. **Proposition.** The cross was the climax of unfolding the divine love. There was nothing in the cross which God required-only that which Jesus so willingly gave.
	> “See in the death of the Son of Man the climax of the unfolding of the Father's divine love for his sons of the mortal spheres. The cross thus portrays the devotion of willing affection and the bestowal of voluntary salvation upon those who are willing to receive such gifts and devotion. There was nothing in the cross which the Father required — only that which Jesus so willingly gave, and which he refused to avoid.” [UB 188:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_11)

13. **Proposition.** The cross was not to effect man's reconciliation, but to stimulate man's realization of the Father's eternal love and the Son's unending mercy.
	> “We know that the death on the cross was not to effect man's reconciliation to God but to stimulate man's _realization_ of the Father's eternal love and his Son's unending mercy, and to broadcast these universal truths to a whole universe.” [UB 188:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_13)

## XXVIII. THE MEANING OF THE CROSS

1. **Proposition.** The cross portrays the supreme devotion of the true shepherd for even the unworthy members of his flock.
	> “The cross of Jesus portrays the full measure of the supreme devotion of the true shepherd for even the unworthy members of his flock. It forever places all relations between God and man upon the family basis. God is the Father; man is his son. Love, the love of a father for his son, becomes the central truth in the universe relations of Creator and creature — not the justice of a king which seeks satisfaction in the sufferings and punishment of the evil-doing subject.” [UB 188:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_1)

2. **Proposition.** The cross exemplifies a love sufficiently strong to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing.
	> “The cross forever shows that the attitude of Jesus toward sinners was neither condemnation nor condonation, but rather eternal and loving salvation. Jesus is truly a savior in the sense that his life and death do win men over to goodness and righteous survival. Jesus loves men so much that his love awakens the response of love in the human heart. Love is truly contagious and eternally creative. Jesus' death on the cross exemplifies a love which is sufficiently strong and divine to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing. Jesus disclosed to this world a higher quality of righteousness than justice — mere technical right and wrong. Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them.” [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

3. **Proposition**. The forgiveness of love transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets guilt aside, but love destroys sin. Salvation does not slight wrongs - it makes them right.
	> “The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom. Jesus brought a new method of living to Urantia. He taught us not to resist evil but to find through him a goodness which effectually destroys evil. The forgiveness of Jesus is not condonation; it is salvation from condemnation. Salvation does not slight wrongs; it _makes them right_.” [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

4. **Proposition**. Love does not condone hate -it destroys it. Salvation is redemption if you mean eternal rehabilitation.
	> “True love does not compromise nor condone hate; it destroys it. The love of Jesus is never satisfied with mere forgiveness. The Master's love implies rehabilitation, eternal survival. It is altogether proper to speak of salvation as redemption if you mean this eternal rehabilitation.” [UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)

5. **Proposition.** The cross is the symbol of wholehearted, unselfish, and sacred service - the devotion of love. The devoted bestowal of the good upon the evil - even unto death.
	> “The cross is that high symbol of sacred service, the devotion of one's life to the welfare and salvation of one's fellows. The cross is not the symbol of the sacrifice of the innocent Son of God in the place of guilty sinners and in order to appease the wrath of an offended God, but it does stand forever, on earth and throughout a vast universe, as a sacred symbol of the good bestowing themselves upon the evil and thereby saving them by this very devotion of love. The cross does stand as the token of the highest form of unselfish service, the supreme devotion of the full bestowal of a righteous life in the service of wholehearted ministry, even in death, the death of the cross. And the very sight of this great symbol of the bestowal life of Jesus truly inspires all of us to want to go and do likewise.” [UB 188:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_9)

## XXIX. THE RESURRECTION

1. **Proposition**. Following commingled material and morontia activities in the tomb, the resurrected morontia form of Jesus came forth.
	> “At two forty-five Sunday morning, the Paradise incarnation commission, consisting of seven unidentified Paradise personalities, arrived on the scene and immediately deployed themselves about the tomb. At ten minutes before three, intense vibrations of commingled material and morontia activities began to issue from Joseph's new tomb, and at two minutes past three o'clock, this Sunday morning, April 9, A.D. 30, the resurrected morontia form and personality of Jesus of Nazareth came forth from the tomb.” [UB 189:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_1)

2. **Proposition.** After the morontia resurrection of Jesus, his physical body was still in the tomb.
	> “After the resurrected Jesus emerged from his burial tomb, the body of flesh in which he had lived and wrought on earth for almost thirty-six years was still lying there in the sepulchre niche, undisturbed and wrapped in the linen sheet, just as it had been laid to rest by Joseph and his associates on Friday afternoon. Neither was the stone before the entrance of the tomb in any way disturbed; the seal of Pilate was still unbroken; the soldiers were still on guard. The temple guards had been on continuous duty; the Roman guard had been changed at midnight. None of these watchers suspected that the object of their vigil had risen to a new and higher form of existence, and that the body which they were guarding was now a discarded outer covering which had no further connection with the delivered and resurrected morontia personality of Jesus.” [UB 189:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_2)

3. **Proposition.** Three statements are offered in clarification of Jesus' resurrection.
	> “Let us forever clarify the concept of the resurrection of Jesus by making the following statements:
	> 
	> “1. His material or physical body was not a part of the resurrected personality. When Jesus came forth from the tomb, his body of flesh remained undisturbed in the sepulchre. He emerged from the burial tomb without moving the stones before the entrance and without disturbing the seals of Pilate.
	> 
	> “2. He did not emerge from the tomb as a spirit nor as Michael of Nebadon; he did not appear in the form of the Creator Sovereign, such as he had had before his incarnation in the likeness of mortal flesh on Urantia.
	> 
	> “3. He did come forth from this tomb of Joseph in the very likeness of the morontia personalities of those who, as resurrected morontia ascendant beings, emerge from the resurrection halls of the first mansion world of this local system of Satania. And the presence of the Michael memorial in the center of the vast court of the resurrection halls of mansonia number one leads us to conjecture that the Master's resurrection on Urantia was in some way fostered on this, the first of the system mansion worlds.” [UB 189:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_6)

4. **Proposition.** The risen Jesus gave orders to his universe aids, asked for the certification of his mortal transit, and greeted the morontians who were present to welcome him.
	> “The first act of Jesus on arising from the tomb was to greet Gabriel and instruct him to continue in executive charge of universe affairs under Immanuel, and then he directed the chief of the Melchizedeks to convey his brotherly greetings to Immanuel. He thereupon asked the Most High of Edentia for the certification of the Ancients of Days as to his mortal transit; and turning to the assembled morontia groups of the seven mansion worlds, here gathered together to greet and welcome their Creator as a creature of their order, Jesus spoke the first words of the postmortal career. Said the morontia Jesus: ‘Having finished my life in the flesh, I would tarry here for a short time in transition form that I may more fully know the life of my ascendant creatures and further reveal the will of my Father in Paradise.’” [UB 189:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_10)

5. **Proposition.** The chief of archangels was granted a mandate empowering him to proceed with the immediate dissolution of the physical body of Jesus.
	> “At ten minutes past three o'clock, as the resurrected Jesus fraternized with the assembled morontia personalities from the seven mansion worlds of Satania, the chief of archangels — the angels of the resurrection — approached Gabriel and asked for the mortal body of Jesus. Said the chief of the archangels: ‘We may not participate in the morontia resurrection of the bestowal experience of Michael our sovereign, but we would have his mortal remains put in our custody for immediate dissolution. We do not propose to employ our technique of dematerialization; we merely wish to invoke the process of accelerated time. It is enough that we have seen the Sovereign live and die on Urantia; the hosts of heaven would be spared the memory of enduring the sight of the slow decay of the human form of the Creator and Upholder of a universe. In the name of the celestial intelligences of all Nebadon, I ask for a mandate giving me the custody of the mortal body of Jesus of Nazareth and empowering us to proceed with its immediate dissolution.’” [UB 189:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_1)

6. **Proposition.** The celestial hosts, with aid from midwayers, removed the body of Jesus from the tomb for its disposal.
	> “After the chief of archangels had been granted this request, he summoned to his assistance many of his fellows, together with a numerous host of the representatives of all orders of celestial personalities, and then, with the aid of the Urantia midwayers, proceeded to take possession of Jesus' physical body. This body of death was a purely material creation; it was physical and literal; it could not be removed from the tomb as the morontia form of the resurrection had been able to escape the sealed sepulchre. By the aid of certain morontia auxiliary personalities, the morontia form can be made at one time as of the spirit so that it can become indifferent to ordinary matter, while at another time it can become discernible and contactable to material beings, such as the mortals of the realm.” [UB 189:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_3)

7. **Proposition.** Rolling away the entrance stone by the midwayers dispersed the guards.
	> “As they made ready to remove the body of Jesus from the tomb preparatory to according it the dignified and reverent disposal of near-instantaneous dissolution, it was assigned the secondary Urantia midwayers to roll away the stones from the entrance of the tomb. The larger of these two stones was a huge circular affair, much like a millstone, and it moved in a groove chiseled out of the rock, so that it could be rolled back and forth to open or close the tomb. When the watching Jewish guards and the Roman soldiers, in the dim light of the morning, saw this huge stone begin to roll away from the entrance of the tomb, apparently of its own accord — without any visible means to account for such motion — they were seized with fear and panic, and they fled in haste from the scene. The Jews fled to their homes, afterward going back to report these doings to their captain at the temple. The Romans fled to the fortress of Antonia and reported what they had seen to the centurion as soon as he arrived on duty.” [UB 189:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_4)

8. **Proposition.** Belief in the resurrection based on the "empty tomb” is indeed a fact - but it is not the truth.
	> “The Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus has been based on the fact of the ‘empty tomb.’ It was indeed a _fact_ that the tomb was empty, but this is not the _truth_ of the resurrection. The tomb was truly empty when the first believers arrived, and this fact, associated with that of the undoubted resurrection of the Master, led to the formulation of a belief which was not true: the teaching that the material and mortal body of Jesus was raised from the grave. Truth having to do with spiritual realities and eternal values cannot always be built up by a combination of apparent facts. Although individual facts may be materially true, it does not follow that the association of a group of facts must necessarily lead to truthful spiritual conclusions.” [UB 189:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_6)

9. **Proposition**. The body of Jesus underwent the same dissolution characteristic of all human bodies - except for the acceleration of time.
	> “The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated, hastened to that point where it became well-nigh instantaneous.” [UB 189:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_8)

10. **Proposition.** Notwithstanding the doubting apostles, David sent forth his messengers as heralds of the resurrection.
	> “From the tomb David and Joseph went immediately to the home of Elijah Mark, where they held a conference with the ten apostles in the upper chamber. Only John Zebedee was disposed to believe, even faintly, that Jesus had risen from the dead. Peter had believed at first but, when he failed to find the Master, fell into grave doubting. They were all disposed to believe that the Jews had removed the body. David would not argue with them, but when he left, he said: ‘You are the apostles, and you ought to understand these things. I will not contend with you; nevertheless, I now go back to the home of Nicodemus, where I have appointed with the messengers to assemble this morning, and when they have gathered together, I will send them forth on their last mission, as heralds of the Master's resurrection. I heard the Master say that, after he should die, he would rise on the third day, and I believe him.’ And thus speaking to the dejected and forlorn ambassadors of the kingdom, this self-appointed chief of communication and intelligence took leave of the apostles. On his way from the upper chamber he dropped the bag of Judas, containing all the apostolic funds, in the lap of Matthew Levi.” [UB 190:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_3)

11. **Proposition.** David's last charge to his messenger corps was: The message which you shall bear to the believers is: "Jesus has risen from the dead; the tomb is empty.”
	> “It was about half past nine o'clock when the last of David's twenty-six messengers arrived at the home of Nicodemus. David promptly assembled them in the spacious courtyard and addressed them:
	> 
	> “ Men and brethren, all this time you have served me in accordance with your oath to me and to one another, and I call you to witness that I have never yet sent out false information at your hands. I am about to send you on your last mission as volunteer messengers of the kingdom, and in so doing I release you from your oaths and thereby disband the messenger corps. Men, I declare to you that we have finished our work. No more does the Master have need of mortal messengers; he has risen from the dead. He told us before they arrested him that he would die and rise again on the third day. I have seen the tomb — it is empty. I have talked with Mary Magdalene and four other women, who have talked with Jesus. I now disband you, bid you farewell, and send you on your respective assignments, and the message which you shall bear to the believers is: ‘Jesus has risen from the dead; the tomb is empty.’” [UB 190:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_4)

## XXX. MORONTIA APPEARANCES

1. **Proposition**. It was by the help of transformers and midwayers that human eyes could see the morontia form of Jesus.
	> “These human eyes were enabled to see the morontia form of Jesus because of the special ministry of the transformers and the midwayers in association with certain of the morontia personalities then accompanying Jesus.” [UB 189:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p4_11)

2. **Proposition.** Said Jesus to Mary: Touch me not - but go and tell my apostles - and Peter-that I have risen.
	> “As Mary sought to embrace his feet, Jesus said: ‘Touch me not, Mary, for I am not as you knew me in the flesh. In this form will I tarry with you for a season before I ascend to the Father. But go, all of you, now and tell my apostles — and Peter — that I have risen, and that you have talked with me.’” [UB 189:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p4_12)

3. **Proposition**. His seventh appearance was to the brothers on the way to Emmaus.
	> “While they thus argued and debated as they made their way toward home, the morontia manifestation of Jesus, his seventh appearance, came alongside them as they journeyed on. Cleopas had often heard Jesus teach and had eaten with him at the homes of Jerusalem believers on several occasions. But he did not recognize the Master even when he spoke freely with them.” [UB 190:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_2)

4. **Proposition.** As Jesus progressed in morontia form it became more and more difficult to see him.
	> “About midnight of this Monday the Master's morontia form was adjusted for transition to the second stage of morontia progression. When he next appeared to his mortal children on earth, it was as a second-stage morontia being. As the Master progressed in the morontia career, it became, technically, more and more difficult for the morontia intelligences and their transforming associates to visualize the Master to mortal and material eyes.
	> 
	> “Jesus made the transit to the third stage of morontia on Friday, April 14; to the fourth stage on Monday, the 17th; to the fifth stage on Saturday, the 22nd; to the sixth stage on Thursday, the 27th; to the seventh stage on Tuesday, May 2; to Jerusem citizenship on Sunday, the 7th; and he entered the embrace of the Most Highs of Edentia on Sunday, the 14th.” [UB 191:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p3_2)

5. **Proposition.** Jesus appeared during the evening meal to Thomas and others.
	> “They were having their evening meal a little after six o'clock, with Peter sitting on one side of Thomas and Nathaniel on the other, when the doubting apostle said: ‘I will not believe unless I see the Master with my own eyes and put my finger in the mark of the nails.’ As they thus sat at supper, and while the doors were securely shut and barred, the morontia Master suddenly appeared inside the curvature of the table and, standing directly in front of Thomas, said:” [UB 191:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_2)

6. **Proposition.** Thomas believed - even without the nail prints.
	> “When Thomas heard these words, he fell on his knees before the morontia Master and exclaimed, ‘I believe! My Lord and my Master!’ Then said Jesus to Thomas: ‘You have believed, Thomas, because you have really seen and heard me. Blessed are those in the ages to come who will believe even though they have not seen with the eye of flesh nor heard with the mortal ear.’” [UB 191:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_5)

7. **Proposition**. He appeared to the eleven and prayed with them on their mount of consecration.
	> “At noon on Saturday, April 22, the eleven apostles assembled by appointment on the hill near Capernaum, and Jesus appeared among them. This meeting occurred on the very mount where the Master had set them apart as his apostles and as ambassadors of the Father's kingdom on earth. And this was the Master's fourteenth morontia manifestation.
	> 
	> “At this time the eleven apostles knelt in a circle about the Master and heard him repeat the charges and saw him re-enact the ordination scene even as when they were first set apart for the special work of the kingdom. And all of this was to them as a memory of their former consecration to the Father's service, except the Master's prayer. When the Master — the morontia Jesus — now prayed, it was in tones of majesty and with words of power such as the apostles had never before heard. Their Master now spoke with the rulers of the universes as one who, in his own universe, had had all power and authority committed to his hand. And these eleven men never forgot this experience of the morontia rededication to the former pledges of ambassadorship. The Master spent just one hour on this mount with his ambassadors, and when he had taken an affectionate farewell of them, he vanished from their sight.” [UB 192:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p3_1)

## XXXI. JESUS' ASCENSION

1. **Proposition.** Jesus gathered with the eleven on Mount Olivet before his ascension.
	> “It was almost half past seven o'clock this Thursday morning, May 18, when Jesus arrived on the western slope of Mount Olivet with his eleven silent and somewhat bewildered apostles. From this location, about two thirds the way up the mountain, they could look out over Jerusalem and down upon Gethsemane. Jesus now prepared to say his last farewell to the apostles before he took leave of Urantia. As he stood there before them, without being directed they knelt about him in a circle, and the Master said:” [UB 193:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_1)

2. **Proposition.** The Master spoke a farewell message and vanished.
	> “ ‘I bade you tarry in Jerusalem until you were endowed with power from on high. I am now about to take leave of you; I am about to ascend to my Father, and soon, very soon, will we send into this world of my sojourn the Spirit of Truth; and when he has come, you shall begin the new proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom, first in Jerusalem and then to the uttermost parts of the world. Love men with the love wherewith I have loved you and serve your fellow mortals even as I have served you. By the spirit fruits of your lives impel souls to believe the truth that man is a son of God, and that all men are brethren. Remember all I have taught you and the life I have lived among you. My love overshadows you, my spirit will dwell with you, and my peace shall abide upon you. Farewell.’
	> 
	> “When the morontia Master had thus spoken, he vanished from their sight. This so-called ascension of Jesus was in no way different from his other disappearances from mortal vision during the forty days of his morontia career on Urantia.” [UB 193:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_2)

## XXXII. SOVEREIGNTY

1. **Proposition**. The bestowal of Michael on Urantia was necessary to his earning the experiential sovereignty of his universe.
	> “The bestowal of a Paradise Son on your world was inherent in the situation of closing a planetary age; it was inescapable, and it was not made necessary for the purpose of winning the favor of God. This bestowal also happened to be the final personal act of a Creator Son in the long adventure of earning the experiential sovereignty of his universe. What a travesty upon the infinite character of God! this teaching that his fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of his creatures that his tender mercies were not forthcoming until he saw his blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Calvary!” [UB 4:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_6)

2. **Proposition.** Bestowal Sons are understanding rulers because, by living experience, they possess themselves of practical mercy, fair judgment, and patience born of experiential creature living.
	> “The Michael Sons begin their work of universe organization with a full and just sympathy for the various orders of beings whom they have created. They have vast stores of mercy for all these differing creatures, even pity for those who err and flounder in the selfish mire of their own production. But such endowments of justice and righteousness will not suffice in the estimate of the Ancients of Days. These triune rulers of the superuniverses will never certify a Creator Son as Universe Sovereign until he has really acquired the viewpoint of his own creatures by actual experience in the environment of their existence and as these very creatures themselves. In this way such Sons become intelligent and understanding rulers; they come to _know_ the various groups over which they rule and exercise universe authority. By living experience they possess themselves of practical mercy, fair judgment, and the patience born of experiential creature existence.” [UB 119:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_6)

3. **Proposition.** The sovereignty bestowals of Michael covered a billion years of Urantia time.
	> “The local universe of Nebadon is now ruled by a Creator Son who has completed his service of bestowal; he reigns in just and merciful supremacy over all the vast realms of his evolving and perfecting universe. Michael of Nebadon is the 611,121st bestowal of the Eternal Son upon the universes of time and space, and he began the organization of your local universe about four hundred billion years ago. Michael made ready for his first bestowal adventure about the time Urantia was taking on its present form, one billion years ago. His bestowals have occurred about one hundred and fifty million years apart, the last taking place on Urantia nineteen hundred years ago.” [UB 119:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_7)

4. **Proposition**. Michael's sovereignty is supreme because:
	1. It embodies the sevenfold attitudes of Paradise Deity.
	2. It embodies the creature viewpoint of time and space.
	> “Michael, therefore, combines in his personal sovereignty the divine will of the sevenfold phases of the universal Creators with the understanding experience of his local universe creatures. Thus has his administration become representative of the greatest possible power and authority although divested of all arbitrary assumptions. His power is unlimited since it is derived from experienced association with the Paradise Deities; his authority is unquestioned inasmuch as it was acquired through actual experience in the likeness of universe creatures; his sovereignty is supreme since it embodies at one and the same time the sevenfold viewpoint of Paradise Deity with the creature viewpoint of time and space.” [UB 120:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_5)

## XXXIII. THE SECOND ADVENT

1. **Proposition.** Urantia is the sentimental shrine of all Nebadon - and Jesus has promised to come again.
	> “Urantia is the sentimental shrine of all Nebadon, the chief of ten million inhabited worlds, the mortal home of Christ Michael, sovereign of all Nebadon, a Melchizedek minister to the realms, a system savior, an Adamic redeemer, a seraphic fellow, an associate of ascending spirits, a morontia progressor, a Son of Man in the likeness of mortal flesh, and the Planetary Prince of Urantia. And your record tells the truth when it says that this same Jesus has promised some time to return to the world of his terminal bestowal, the World of the Cross.” [UB 119:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_8)

2. **Proposition**. The doctrine of the second advent was early made a part of Christianity and subsequent generations have confidently looked for his coming.
	> “On several occasions Jesus had made statements which led his hearers to infer that, while he intended presently to leave this world, he would most certainly return to consummate the work of the heavenly kingdom. As the conviction grew on his followers that he was going to leave them, and after he had departed from this world, it was only natural for all believers to lay fast hold upon these promises to return. The doctrine of the second coming of Christ thus became early incorporated into the teachings of the Christians, and almost every subsequent generation of disciples has devoutly believed this truth and has confidently looked forward to his sometime coming.” [UB 176:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_1)

3. **Proposition.** Jesus was at great pains to prevent the association of his second coming with the destruction of Jerusalem.
	> “If they were to part with their Master and Teacher, how much more did these first disciples and the apostles grasp at this promise to return, and they lost no time in associating the predicted destruction of Jerusalem with this promised second coming. And they continued thus to interpret his words notwithstanding that, throughout this evening of instruction on Mount Olivet, the Master took particular pains to prevent just such a mistake.” [UB 176:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_2)

4. **Proposition**. Said Jesus: “...be of good courage, for I will sometime return.”
	> “...I also promise that I will sometime return to this world, where I have lived this life in the flesh and achieved the experience of simultaneously revealing God to man and leading man to God. Very soon must I leave you and take up the work the Father has intrusted to my hands, but be of good courage, for I will sometime return. In the meantime, my Spirit of the Truth of a universe shall comfort and guide you.” [UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3)

5. **Proposition.** Said Jesus: “...when I return, it shall be with power and in the spirit...only the eye of the spirit will behold the Son of Man glorified...”
	> “‘You behold me now in weakness and in the flesh, but when I return, it shall be with power and in the spirit. The eye of flesh beholds the Son of Man in the flesh, but only the eye of the spirit will behold the Son of Man glorified by the Father and appearing on earth in his own name.’” [UB 176:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_4)

6. **Proposition**. The times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise.
	> “‘But the times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise; not even the angels of heaven know when this will occur. However, you should understand that, when this gospel of the kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the world for the salvation of all peoples, and when the fullness of the age has come to pass, the Father will send you another dispensational bestowal, or else the Son of Man will return to adjudge the age.’” [UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5)

7. **Proposition.** You would do well to disassociate the Master’s return from all set events or settled epochs.
	> “You would do well, therefore, to disassociate the Master's personal return to earth from any and all set events or settled epochs. We are sure of only one thing: He has promised to come back. We have no idea as to when he will fulfill this promise or in what connection. As far as we know, he may appear on earth any day, and he may not come until age after age has passed and been duly adjudicated by his associated Sons of the Paradise corps.” [UB 176:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_6)

8. **Proposition**. It is of no serious concern whether we go to him or whether he should first come to us.
	> “The second advent of Michael on earth is an event of tremendous sentimental value to both midwayers and humans; but otherwise it is of no immediate moment to midwayers and of no more practical importance to human beings than the common event of natural death, which so suddenly precipitates mortal man into the immediate grasp of that succession of universe events which leads directly to the presence of this same Jesus, the sovereign ruler of our universe. The children of light are all destined to see him, and it is of no serious concern whether we go to him or whether he should chance first to come to us. Be you therefore ever ready to welcome him on earth as he stands ready to welcome you in heaven. We confidently look for his glorious appearing, even for repeated comings, but we are wholly ignorant as to how, when, or in what connection he is destined to appear.” [UB 176:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_7)


The second advent is mentioned 318 times in the New Testament.

### THE BIBLE

> “And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.”And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.” [John 14:3](/en/Bible/John/14#v3)
> 
> “For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done.” [Matt 16:27](/en/Bible/Matthew/16#v27)
> 
> “It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.” [1 John 3:2](/en/Bible/1_John/3#v2)
> 
> “This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same as you saw him go into heaven.” [Acts 1:11](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/1#v11)
> 
> “Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see him.” [Rev 1:7](/en/Bible/Revelation/1#v7)

> 
> “But our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.” [Phil 3:20](/en/Bible/Philippians/3#v20)

## XXXIV. THE FAITH OF JESUS

1. **Proposition**. Jesus experienced the tranquillity of unquestioned trust in God and felt the tremendous thrill of living in the very presence of the heavenly Father.
	> “Jesus did not cling to faith in God as would a struggling soul at war with the universe and at death grips with a hostile and sinful world; he did not resort to faith merely as a consolation in the midst of difficulties or as a comfort in threatened despair; faith was not just an illusory compensation for the unpleasant realities and the sorrows of living. In the very face of all the natural difficulties and the temporal contradictions of mortal existence, he experienced the tranquillity of supreme and unquestioned trust in God and felt the tremendous thrill of living, by faith, in the very presence of the heavenly Father.” [UB 196:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_3)

2. **Proposition.** Jesus humanly demonstrated a new and higher type of living faith in God - God became a living reality in his human experience.
	> “And this triumphant faith was a living experience of actual spirit attainment. Jesus' great contribution to the values of human experience was not that he revealed so many new ideas about the Father in heaven, but rather that he so magnificently and humanly demonstrated a new and higher type of _living faith in God_. Never on all the worlds of this universe, in the life of any one mortal, did God ever become such a _living reality_ as in the human experience of Jesus of Nazareth.” [UB 196:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_3)

3. **Proposition.** In Jesus' life all worlds discover a new religion based on personal spiritual relations with the Universal Father.
	> “In the Master's life on Urantia, this and all other worlds of the local creation discover a new and higher type of religion, religion based on personal spiritual relations with the Universal Father and wholly validated by the supreme authority of genuine personal experience. This living faith of Jesus was more than an intellectual reflection, and it was not a mystic meditation.” [UB 196:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_4)

4. **Proposition.** Theology may fix and dogmatize faith, but Jesus had a personal and original faith that securely held him. This faith was undaunted by the cruel threat of an ignominious death.
	> “Theology may fix, formulate, define, and dogmatize faith, but in the human life of Jesus faith was personal, living, original, spontaneous, and purely spiritual. This faith was not reverence for tradition nor a mere intellectual belief which he held as a sacred creed, but rather a sublime experience and a profound conviction which _securely held him_. His faith was so real and all-encompassing that it absolutely swept away any spiritual doubts and effectively destroyed every conflicting desire. Nothing was able to tear him away from the spiritual anchorage of this fervent, sublime, and undaunted faith. Even in the face of apparent defeat or in the throes of disappointment and threatening despair, he calmly stood in the divine presence free from fear and fully conscious of spiritual invincibility. Jesus enjoyed the invigorating assurance of the possession of unflinching faith, and in each of life's trying situations he unfailingly exhibited an unquestioning loyalty to the Father's will. And this superb faith was undaunted even by the cruel and crushing threat of an ignominious death.” [UB 196:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_5)

5. **Proposition.** His faith was neither traditional nor merely intellectual; it was wholly personal and purely spiritual.
	> “Jesus enjoyed a sublime and wholehearted faith in God. He experienced the ordinary ups and downs of mortal existence, but he never religiously doubted the certainty of God's watchcare and guidance. His faith was the outgrowth of the insight born of the activity of the divine presence, his indwelling Adjuster. His faith was neither traditional nor merely intellectual; it was wholly personal and purely spiritual.” [UB 196:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_1)

6. **Proposition.** He devoted himself to the doing of the will of God with amazing and unbounded enthusiasm, but throughout all his extraordinary life there never appeared the fury of the fanatic nor the superficial frothiness of the religious egotist.
	> “The faith of Jesus visualized all spirit values as being found in the kingdom of God; therefore he said, ‘Seek first the kingdom of heaven.’ Jesus saw in the advanced and ideal fellowship of the kingdom the achievement and fulfillment of the ‘will of God.’ The very heart of the prayer which he taught his disciples was, ‘Your kingdom come; your will be done.’ Having thus conceived of the kingdom as comprising the will of God, he devoted himself to the cause of its realization with amazing self-forgetfulness and unbounded enthusiasm. But in all his intense mission and throughout his extraordinary life there never appeared the fury of the fanatic nor the superficial frothiness of the religious egotist.” [UB 196:0.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_8)
