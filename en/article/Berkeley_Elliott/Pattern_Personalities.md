The Eternal Son is the pattern personality, but only the Universal Father—the ancestor and source of this absolute pattern—can bestow personality. “Pattern” indicates an original (a model, guide, or archetype), and since the Eternal Son is the pattern personality, what an excellent model for all personalities in God's universe.

Pattern personalities seem to be the first of their order-like the original pattern angel (supernaphim) of Paradise and the original (first-born) pattern angel (seraphim) of the local universe, In Havona there are many classes of pattern beings-actually a pattern being for all personalities in all universes. The outer circuits contain patterns for time and space mortals' goal attainment.

Personalities of the same _series_, _order_, _type_, or pattern will be similar, but never exactly alike. Personalities on Urantia do function in a framework of superuniverse, local universe, and planet series, order, type, and pattern of personality, so there must be a resemblance of Urantia personalities, as compared to other planets, local universes, and even superuniverses, Although there may be similarities, each is exclusive and is further qualified by the material, mindal, and spiritual energies upon which personality is bestowed.

Personalities may follow series, types, orders, and patterns, but each is unique, the only one of its kind. No two are alike, ever have been, or ever will be! Personality is an individual's identity throughout eternity.

Every personality has a direct line to the Universal Father through the personality circuit, in addition to self-consciousness, and the priceless gift of tree will. Since each personality on Urantia (and throughout God's universe) is original, it follows that each could be considered a “pattern personality.”
