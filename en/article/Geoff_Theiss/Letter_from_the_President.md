Dear friends of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship,

Because relationship between Urantia Book students is at the center of what makes up this community, we are working on creative ways to engage, support, connect, inspire, learn from, teach, and serve one another.

Aside from the inspiring efforts you will read about below, the Executive Committee has been working on the following projects this summer:

- exploring ways to support local and online community
- the redesign of our website
- printing of the next edition of the Uversa Press Urantia Book
- on a vision for this organization that elevates the living truth and spiritual transformation found within the Urantia Book

This organization has an amazing team of volunteers and staff who are passionately engaged in sharing this life-changing revelation.

Please enjoy an update from some of our team!
