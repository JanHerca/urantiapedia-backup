> “The lives and experiences of the men and women who ventured forth from Salem, Mesopotamia, and Lake Van to enlighten the tribes of Eastern Hemisphere present a heroic chapter in the annals of the human race.” <a id="a42_212"></a>[[UB 93:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p7_2)]

> “The early teachers of the Salem religion penetrated to the remotest tribes of Africa and Eurasia ... Urantia has never had more enthusiastic and aggressive missionaries of any religion than these noble men and women who carried the teachings of M elchizedek over the entire Eastern Hemisphere.” <a id="a44_298"></a>[[UB 94:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p0_1)]

> “The Salem missionaries spread out all over southwestern A sia, through Palestine, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Iran, and Arabia, everywhere proclaiming the good news of the gospel of Machiventa Melchizedek.” <a id="a46_202"></a>[[UB 95:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p0_1)]

Wouldn't it be wonderful to go back in time and hear the stirring words of these heroic missionaries? Imagine how that would enlarge and strengthen our grasp of Machiventa's teachings!

I've only recently realized and fully appreciated that [Paper 131](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131), The World's Religions, does exactly that. It complements and completes the earlier series of Melchizedek papers from Part III of The Urantia Book.

Wouldn't it be wonderful to go back in time and hear the stirring words of these heroic missionaries? Here we find Ganid's compilation of religious teachings from the library at Alexandria, carried out with guidance and assistance from Jesus. While this manuscript “was preserved in India for hundreds of years” <a id="a52_312"></a>[[UB 131:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p0_2)], I think it also represents Jesus' desire to keep Melchizedek's work alive for all future generations, knowing that excerpts would someday be reproduced and shared by the midwayers for our benefit.

This project, accomplished through great effort and at significant expense, provides a direct record of the “preachments” of the Salem missionaries, along with closely related insights that were inspired by the work of these noble teachers of the Salem gospel.

> “And it should be made plain in this record that all these teachings portraying monotheism were largely derived, directly or indirectly, from the preachments of the missionaries of Machiventa Melchizedek, who went forth from their Salem headquarters to spread the doctrine of one God - the Most High - to the ends of the earth.” <a id="a56_331"></a>[[UB 131:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p0_1)]

What follows is a sampling of my personal favorites from these teachings, collected under the headings of the various religions from which they were drawn. We can see that all of these religions share a common revelatory origin in the teachings of Machiventa Melchizedek, as conveyed to the world by the Salem missionaries.

It's also interesting, I think, to see that many of these ideas reappear in Jesus' teachings, suggesting that Michael and Machiventa may have collaborated in the conceptual development of their revelation plans for Urantia. We also know that Jesus and Machiventa shared the inner presence of the same powerful Thought A djuster, which no doubt contributed immensely to their expressive formulations of divine revelation.

## 1. Cynicism

<figcaption><em>Buddha</em></figcaption>

> “Ganid ... did find some record of certain earlier beliefs which reflected something of the influence of the teachings of the Melchizedek missionaries who continued their work in India even to the times of Buddha.” <a id="a111_217"></a>[[UB 131:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_1)]

> “Out of a pure heart shall gladness spring forth to the Infinite; all my being shall be at peace with this supermortal rejoicing. My soul is filled with content, and my heart overflows with the bliss of peaceful trust. I have no fear; I am free from anxiety.” <a id="a113_262"></a>[[UB 131:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_2)] 

> “Cheerfulness and gladness are the rew ards of deeds well done and to the glory of the Immortal. No man can rob you of the liberty of your own mind.... While faith is the energy of the better life, nevertheless, must you work out your own salvation with perseverance. If you would be certain of your final salvation, then make sure that you sincerely seek to fulfill all righteousness.” <a id="a115_389"></a>[[UB 131:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_4)]

<figcaption><em>Om</em></figcaption>

> "The missionaries of Melchizedek carried the teachings of the one God with them wherever they journeyed. Much of this monotheistic doctrine, together with other and previous concepts, became embodied in the subsequent teachings of Hinduism." <a id="a128_244"></a>[[UB 131:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p4_1)]

> “Says the Lord: ‘I dwell within their own souls as a lamp of wisdom. I am the splendor of the splendid and the goodness of the good.

Let us long meditate on the adorable and divine Vivifier; let his spirit fully direct our thoughts.” <a id="a132_349"></a>[[UB 131:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p4_3)]

<figcaption><em>Zoroaster</em></figcaption>
</figure>

> "Zoroaster was himself directly in contact with the descendants of the earlier M elchizedek missionaries, and their doctrine of the one God became a central teaching in the religion which he founded in Persia. A side from Judaism, no religion of that day contained more of these Salem teachings." <a id="a145_299"></a>[[UB 131:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p5_1)]

> “God is farthest from us and at the same time nearest to us in that he dwells within our souls. Our God is the divine and holiest Spirit of Paradise, and yet he is more friendly to man than the most friendly of all creatures.... God is our most adorable and righteous friend; he is our wisdom, life, and vigor of soul and body. Through our good thinking the wise Creator will enable us to do his will, thereby attaining the realization of all that is divinely perfect.” <a id="a147_472"></a>[[UB 131:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p5_3)]

> "We are assured of the life hereafter if we know truth. The soul of man may ascend to the highest heaven, there to develop its true spiritual nature, to attain perfection.... Man's greatest victory is the conquest of himself. When man looks to G od for forgiveness, and when he makes bold to enjoy such liberty, he is thereby delivered from fear." <a id="a162_350"></a>[[UB 131:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p6_2)]
