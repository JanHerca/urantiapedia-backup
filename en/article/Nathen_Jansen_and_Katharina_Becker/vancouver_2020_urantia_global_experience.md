The Urantia Association of Canada and The Urantia Book Fellowship have teamed up to host this gathering in the Vancouver Fraser Valley. They invite everyone to come together to serve the global community by making a personal contribution to civilization on Urantia.

The Urantia Global Experience is a gathering of minds dedicated to serving God the Supreme through the exploration of solutions for the progressive evolution of civilization. We believe the overall success of this experimental endeavor rests on our spiritual unity—our common motive to express the will of God in our personal daily lives as well as in our social institutions.

The format of this gathering will be a little different than past experiences. Rather than a series of lectures and workshops, all participants will engage in discussion groups focused on a variety of topics drawn from _The Urantia Book_ (see Paper 71:4 Progressive Civilization). From these discussions, we hope to derive common ideas, solutions, and purpose.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

To implement these grand ideals, we need your help. We are currently taking applications for Facilitators and Visionary Exploration presenters, as well as for volunteers.

- **Facilitator Pairs** – are required to moderate the discussions in both Focus Groups and Vision Teams. These discussions will focus on the 12 points of progressive civilization as placed in the context of working with the Supreme, and all Facilitators should be conversant in these areas.
- **Presenters** – further discussions (Visionary Explorations) are dedicated to the advancement of civilization through current active projects, planned projects, and great ideas for new projects.
- **Volunteers** – anyone who would like to lend a helping hand as custodians or ushers, as well as setting up equipment, cleaning, or doing a great variety of minor chores. We also need people who would like to sing in our choir.
