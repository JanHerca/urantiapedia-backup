_By Betty Tresnawaty, Jakarta, Indonesia_

My spiritual thirst was quenched two years ago when I discovered _The Urantia Book_. A friend gave it to me, and secretly I began to study it. To openly study _The Urantia Book_ in Indonesia could be very risky, as the majority of the Indonesian people are Muslims. Some members of my family learned that I am reading _The Urantia Book_, and it put a strain on our relationship, especially my relationship with my sister. But all of this is not an obstacle for me. I am not trying to win a popularity contest. The important thing is that I am known, and maybe even popular, among the angels and our other unseen friends.

The values in _The Urantia Book_ are applicable in our daily lives. It not only contains history, cosmology, science, and religion, but it contains teachings and guidance for everyday life. I think the real meanings and values that one can derive from reading _The Urantia Book_ come not from reading the book with human eyes only but from reading it carefully, examining the teachings deeply, and discerning them spiritually and then implementing them into our lives.

_The Urantia Book_ has changed my life! My view of life is no longer narrow and skeptical. I am happier, and I feel comfortable communicating and interacting with people from different backgrounds. There is a beauty that is difficult to describe. I feel God's love within me, and I feel it radiating around and from me.

> “Arise and shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Darkness may cover the earth and gross darkness the people, but the spirit of the Lord shall arise upon you, and the divine glory shall be seen with you. Even the gentiles shall come to this light, and many great minds shall surrender to the brightness of this light.” <a id="a48_360"></a>[UB 145:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p2_2)

I feel that it is important to share it, so that other people will experience the benefits that I have derived from it. How wonderful it will be when all of the inhabitants on earth absorb the values of _The Urantia Book_ and live the teachings. Doing so will make life happier, peaceful, and better. Moreover, if we share with others this happiness, it will be felt by all of us. Human beings cannot be happy alone.

> “Happiness and joy take origin in the inner life. You cannot experience real joy all by yourself. A solitary life is fatal to happiness. Even families and nations will enjoy life more if they share it with others.” <a id="a52_217"></a>[UB 111:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_7)

How beautiful the world could be if there is no more violence, war, or other vices that make our planet unstable.

Based on my experience of the last two years, I can spread the values of _The Urantia Book_ through the example of my good behavior. Meanwhile, I can invite others to come and read _The Urantia Book_ and to join in some of the other programs I offer like stress management, self-discovery, and cooperation with one's Thought Adjuster. I developed these programs based on ideas from _The Urantia Book_.

> “**Mind is your ship, the Adjuster is your pilot, the human will is captain**. The master of the mortal vessel should have the wisdom to trust the divine pilot to guide the ascending soul into the morontia harbors of eternal survival. Only by selfishness, slothfulness, and sinfulness can the will of man reject the guidance of such a loving pilot and eventually wreck the mortal career upon the evil shoals of rejected mercy and upon the rocks of embraced sin. **With your consent**, this faithful pilot will safely carry you across the barriers of time and the handicaps of space to the very source of the divine mind and on beyond, even to the Paradise Father of Adjusters.” <a id="a58_680"></a>[UB 111:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_9)

Thus I spread the teachings through these training programs, and step by step, the teachings spread to many people without my mentioning the book.

Some time ago I received ten books from Urantia Foundation (thanks to Tamara for sending them), and I gave the books to my colleagues at the university where I am studying for a PhD. I think that my colleagues will be more open to read and study _The Urantia Book_ because they are intelligent, insightful, and analytical. In addition, my dissertation pertains to _The Urantia Book_. I hope that one day more and more people will find the book through my academic presentation after my dissertation research is completed. It is my mission to spread the light and become the salt of the Earth.
