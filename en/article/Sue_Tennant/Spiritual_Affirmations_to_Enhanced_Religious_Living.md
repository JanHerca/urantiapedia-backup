The ideal religious life is one in which the individual maintains unbroken communion with the indwelling spirit so that the inner life of reflection, meditation, and prayer transcends and transforms the outer life through loving service to the brother/sisterhood of humankind. This is called the religion of the spirit and differs from other religious practices in that it is personal, original, liberating, spontaneous and inclusive.

It is defined not by rules, but by love. And while this human and spirit relationship may be enhanced by the timeless truths of the world's religions, it is not dependent on any religious ritual or dogma. It depends solely on living faith — the positive assertion of how things ought to be — the universal will of God. In teaching the religion of the spirit, the Master left behind a great legacy of spiritual affirmations. These positive statements of truth banish fear and enlarge human understanding of God's love and purpose. The Infinite so values each finite mortal as a beloved son or daughter that he gives a spirit fragment of himself to help the individual grow an eternal soul which is destined to become God-like. Becoming God-like is learning to regard all others as God regards us and to co-create reality with his spirit — to actually do the positive and progressive will of God.

This spirit gift hails from the Absolute and Infinite Source of all personality, love, spirit, unity and energy — a level of reality which makes no distinction between potentials and actuals and therefore knows everything. The spirit in us is not limited as human nature is limited. The good news is that when we know God as our Father, our individual mortal potential becomes unlimited, eternal and divine. Spiritual affirmations can strengthen even a grain of faith. Material reality is ultimately subject to the power of mind and the sovereignty of spirit. Many of our life circumstances are the consequences of our thoughts and how we act (or don't act) on them. The quality of these thoughts, our faith, is directly proportional to how much we permit the Father's presence in us to spiritualize our thinking.

A strong faith, combined with patience and intelligent effort, can heal broken relationships and remove mountains of material difficulty. It is entirely an individual matter how frequently to affirm spiritual truths, but since it's so uplifting and pleasurable, more is better than less. The first thing in the morning it is effective because the mind is so receptive, and then often throughout the day it can

## Examples of Spiritual Affirmations

***On son/daughtership with God:***

I choose to affirm God as my Father and I never doubt his love and mercy. Moment by moment, day by day, I permit the indwelling spirit to transform my perceptions, thinking and actions. I am led step by step from darkness to light, from despair to hope. The universe is generous and provides me with all I need to learn and grow.

***On a social level:***

I have an unconditional loving regard for all people at all times. I am forgiven as I forgive all those who distress and wound me. In all situations and with all people I am saved by faith and at peace with God. I take full responsibility for my personal happiness. In all things I prefer to do good to others.

***In times of uncertainty:***

I am grounded in faith and unmoved by fear. When the path is hard and the hour is dark I am unafraid. My love of life ensures my survival in this life and the next. I am God's precious child and he will make my struggle a blessing. I am never alone. The angels guard me and the spirit gives me comfort and peace. I belong to the universe family because I am unique, irreplaceable and cherished. I know that God yearns to be loved and known as I yearn to be known and loved.

I am God's beloved child and I always desire to do good. When I set worthy goals, universe energies are released to help me.

***On prayer:***

When I pray my soul can breathe.I am never discouraged; all my prayers are answered in the fullness of time. I give thanks for all things because I trust God with my life. I pray for guidance, strength, courage, patience, and faith, not for things. I pray often and in private. I take time to pray for others because I am graced by faith. I pray to extend the religion of the spirit on earth. I am learning that with God, nothing, absolutely nothing, is impossible.

***On making difficult changes:***

I correct my ways because God is good and he perfects me in love. As God is sovereign in me I fully master myself. I cleanse myself of all evils of mind and body while I seek perfection in the love of God. I master my self by faith in the spirit which ever works by love. My soul receives the nature and character of God.

***On failure:***

I am created to grow perfect through trial and error. Imperfection is my teacher and I grow wise from my mistakes. Failure teaches me to depend on spirit for change and growth. When I feel gratitude I free myself from all guidance. I am given the sweet ministry of brother/sisterhood and am led in the pathway of loving service. I am a liberated son/daughter of God and commissioned to serve all religions and all peoples. I focus my energies on spiritual renewal and intellectual freedom. I free the thinking of others to accept son/daughtership with God. My life choices symbolize my fraternity with all people. I heal the souls of others by replacing age-old fears with faith. My compassion enfolds the weak and afflicted.

***On doing the will of God:***

The spirit lives in me and in every way I am empowered to do the will of God. I use my intelligence and imagination to envision how things ought to be. I change myself and the world by reaching for high ideals. Moment by moment, day by day, I co-create the brother/sisterhood of humankind. I maintain unbroken communion with spirit and teach others
