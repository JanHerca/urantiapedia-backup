I have elected myself and have been given a share of participation in our Universal Plan; spiritually I know that my guardian angel beckons me in a manner that is. delightful, but persuasive.

A body of 144 seraphim serves on an evolutionary sphere of creature habitation: “_These angels preside over all seraphic assemblies pertaining to the line of duty or call to worship._” (<a id="a35_186"></a>[UB 39:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p1_16))

The spirit of brotherhood survives on Urantia because of the seraphims' work of achieving racial harmony and social cooperation among our diverse races. “_Without the work of these seraphim the efforts of the Material Sons to harmonize and advance the races of an evolving world would be greatly delayed. And had your Adam adhered to the original plan for the advancement of Urantia, by this time these spirits of brotherhood would have worked unbelievable transformations in the human race. In view of the Adamic default, it is indeed remarkable that these seraphic orders have been able to foster ... even as much of brotherhood as you now have on Urantia_.” (<a id="a37_662"></a>[UB 39:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_4))

Some seraphim are designated as souls of peace. “_Peace is not the natural state of the material realms, The worlds first realize ‘peace on earth and good will among men’ through the ministry of the seraphic souls of peace.” “Although these angels were... thwarted in their early efforts on Urantia, Vevona, chief of the souls of peace in Adam's day, was left on Urantia and is now attached to the staff of the resident governor general. And it was this same Vevona who, when Michael was born, heralded to the worlds, as the leader of the angelic host, ‘Glory to God in Havona and on earth peace and good will among men.’_” (<a id="a39_625"></a>[UB 39:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_5))

In advanced epochs of planetary evolution these seraphim supplant “_... the atonement idea by the concept of divine attunement as a philosophy of mortal survival._”〈<a id="a41_165"></a>[UB 39:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_6)〉

> “_Suspicion is the inherent reaction of primitive men; the survival struggles of the early ages do not naturally breed trust. Trust is a new human acquisition brought about by the ministry of these planetary seraphim of the Adamic regime, It is their mission to inculcate trust into the minds of evolving men. The Gods are very trustful; the Universal Father is willing freely to trust himself the Adjuster — to man's association._” (<a id="a43_436"></a>[UB 39:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_7))
