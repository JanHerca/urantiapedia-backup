The Secretary's primary tasks involve keeping organizational records. These tasks include: the recording of meeting minutes of the General Council; assembling Fellowship census information; and recording minutes of the meetings of the Fellowship corporation, the Fifth Epochal Fellowship. The Secretary is also responsible for keeping up to date records of society membership.

The Secretary is a member of the General Council and Executive Committee and participates in all the discussions and decisions of those bodies. This often results in assigned tasks that involve more time and effort than the primary tasks of record keeping.

I am now 79 years old and nearing the end of my 40+ year service with the Fellowship. During that period I have held several offices, including President, Judicial Committee chair, Membership Committee chair, co-chair of three international conferences, and a number of ad-hoc committees. I feel truly blessed to have had these service opportunities, and especially to have served with the many persons I have come to know and love through this work.

I would like to help the next Secretary get up to speed with the job. That person would need to be a member of the General Council willing to serve on the Executive Committee. Anyone interested? Please let me know.
