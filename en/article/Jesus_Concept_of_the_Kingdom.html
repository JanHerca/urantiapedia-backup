<p>Jesus’ Concept of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;The Master made it clear that the kingdom of heaven must begin with, and be centered in, the dual concept of the truth of the fatherhood of God and the correlated fact of the brotherhood of man. The acceptance of such a teaching, Jesus declared, would liberate man from the age-long bondage of animal fear and at the same time enrich human living with the following endowments of the new life of spiritual liberty:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The possession of new courage and augmented spiritual power. The gospel of the kingdom was to set man free and inspire him to dare to hope for eternal life.</p>
<p>&quot;2. The gospel carried a message of new confidence and true consolation for all men, even for the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;3. It was in itself a new standard of moral values, a new ethical yardstick wherewith to measure human conduct. It portrayed the ideal of a resultant new order of human society.</p>
<p>&quot;4. It taught the pre-eminence of the spiritual compared with the material; it glorified spiritual realities and exalted superhuman ideals.</p>
<p>&quot;5. This new gospel held up spiritual attainment as the true goal of living. Human life received a new endowment of moral value and divine dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;6. Jesus taught that eternal realities were the result (reward) of righteous earthly striving. Man’s mortal sojourn on earth acquired new meanings consequent upon the recognition of a noble destiny.</p>
<p>“7. The new gospel affirmed that human salvation is the revelation of a far-reaching divine purpose to be fulfilled and realized in the future destiny of the endless service of the salvaged sons of God.” (1859)</p>
