The Fellowship has scheduled the 1997 Summer Session at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver July 10-13, 1997. Spiritual and artistic retreats will occur two days prior in this lovely setting. The campus is situated on a wooded peninsula jutting out into the pristine Georgia Straits and features miles of forested trails leading to unspoiled beaches, all within a 10-minute walk of the school.

July weather is nearly perfect, with sunny skies and temperatures in the 70 s and low 80 s. Most rooms in the 16 -story residential tower have breathtaking views of the Straits, mountains, and Vancouver skyline.

The cafeteria offers multinational foods of a very high quality. With daily adult rates for room and three meals at about $\$ 45$ U.S., the cost of your stay will be most reasonable.

The Education Committee has developed a new, compact format for the Summer Seminar, with emphasis on working with local readers to develop program materials and on presenting timely educational topics selected from feedback provided by previous seminar attendees. The theme of next summer's seminar is “The Three Rs — Relationship, Religion and Revelation.” (See sidebar on next page.)

The seminar will run three days, from Thursday evening, July 10 , to Sunday, July 13 , at noon. The sessions will offer a balanced program of focused study group activities in the mornings, with a broad range of topical afternoon workshop options. In addition, local readers are organizing family and small-group afternoon reversion activities. While the morning program will closely follow the seminar theme, the afternoon program will explore a variety of related subjects such as:
- Developing a new school of evangels — the duty of sonship
- Finding a scientific viewpoint for _The Urantia Book_
- Practicing skills for interfaith dialogue
- The rights of children and Jesusonian values
- Spiritual healing of the planet through _The Urantia Book_
- Emotional intelligence and Urantia Book parallels
- Art, heart and soul — artistic emotion mapping

Evenings are reserved for worship, music and socializing. On Saturday salmon bake dinner followed by a Cajun/Zydeco dance.

The Family Life Committee is working with local readers to provide a stimulating children's program during morning sessions. Arrangements for paid child care at reasonable rates will be available at other times through the University of British Columbia.

For those readers who want a longer, more varied conference experience, a two-day contemplative spiritual retreat facilitated by Gard Jameson will begin on Wednesday, July 9th. During the same period, Patrick Yesh will coordinate an artists' retreat leading to creative forms of spiritual worship.

Final checkout can be extended to Tuesday morning, July 15 th.

Registration information will be mailed in early spring.
