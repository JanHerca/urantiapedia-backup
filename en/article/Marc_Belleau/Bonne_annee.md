Treasurer

2024 has just begun and I would like to wish you a year full of peace. With all these wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan, Congo and elsewhere in the world, this is the most desirable thing there is right now. I pray every night that the leaders of our planet will show goodwill and come to a solution to end the suffering that people are going through right now. I want to continue to believe that this is possible. This is what I wish for all of us this year.

I would not be a good treasurer if I did not talk to you about finances. I would like to remind you that it is time to renew your membership in the AUQ. Without your financial support, the AUQ cannot pursue its projects aimed at energizing the Urantia movement in Quebec, supporting the formation of study groups, promoting the book and its teachings. Several services are offered by your association, whether it is the organization of themes, the updating and maintenance of its website, the creation of supplementary literature or social activities allowing readers to meet and fraternize. Membership, at a cost of $60 per year, gives you the right to vote at the annual general meetings, the possibility of occupying a position on the board of directors and sitting on one or more committees. In addition, you automatically become a member of the Urantia Association of Canada. You will find more information on the AUQ website at the following address: http://urantia-quebec.ca/. I would like to remind you that no receipt for tax purposes can be issued for the membership fee.

Have you thought about making a donation to your association? No matter the amount, what matters is giving a helping hand to help the AUQ accomplish its mission. It's also a good way to reduce what you pay annually to the government for the benefit of a cause you believe in. In fact, donations are tax deductible. The AUQ sends a receipt to all donors every January, regardless of the amount of the donation. A little reminder, don't forget to update your address on the AUQ website or by writing to Line St-Pierre, communications manager. You can send her an email at the following address: communication@urantiaqc.org. Otherwise, you may not receive your tax receipt.

Would you like to see your donation go to a specific project? I suggest you support the project to print the French version of the book “_The Untold Story of the Life of Jesus_”. We need $25,000 to print this book. To date, we have raised nearly $0% of the funds. This beautifully illustrated book tells the story of the incarnational life of Jesus of Nazareth based on what is revealed to us in _The Urantia Book_. You can make an Interac transfer using the following information: Urantia Association of Quebec with the treasurer's address, tresorier@urantiaqc.org. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact me by email. I will be happy to help you!

Looking forward to seeing you again soon. ■
