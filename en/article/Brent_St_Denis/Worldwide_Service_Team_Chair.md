As the Worldwide Service Team Chair I have the pleasure of representing on the Executive Committee the following Fellowship standing committees:

1. Interfaith (Chair, Geoff Taylor)
2. Outreach (Chair, Paula Thompson)
3. YaYA -Youth and Young Adult (Chair, Sean Privitera)
4. International (Chair, André Radatus-filling a vacancy after years of service by Derek Samaras)

We are still learning how the new Service Team Chair (STC) system should work, but as we grow in our understanding I am of the belief that the three STCs are to facilitate and support the work of the committees which includes advocating for their genuine organizational needs.

The International Committee has included me in their regular Zoom meetings so I have had a chance to witness first-hand their devotion as they tackle the realities of working around the world in support of the revelation.

Interfaith has demonstrated a keen understanding of their role as they test the waters at different “spiritual and religious” venues in order to find the right places to present the Urantia Book to those searching for truth anywhere they might find it.

YaYA has made exemplary efforts to either sponsor or participate in youth gatherings and in so doing our young readers can feel welcome in the movement; they are our future leaders.

And Outreach has been tireless in making sure that the Urantia Book is on display and volunteers are available at as many book fairs and other events as possible. This work is essential.

We are all starting to prepare for the 2020 Fellowship budget which is targeted for completion by this November. As part of this process, committees are tasked to submit estimates ideally by the end of September with amounts required, line item rationale, deliverables and expected outcomes so that valuable donor funds are spent wisely in support of the Fellowship vision.
