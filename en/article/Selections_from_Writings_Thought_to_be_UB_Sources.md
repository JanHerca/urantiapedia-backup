> Webmaster's note: Research into the human sources used by the revelators in the construction of the text of The Urantia Book is just beginning. The resources on this page are provided to encourage additional study and exploration and to provide a sense of the way in which human resources have been used in the construction of the text. These materials been scanned from books, some of which are old and not in good condition. Therefore, expect to find typos, including the “-” character where the original was hyphenated. Another frequent problem is the number “5” reproduced as the letter “S.” Numbers reproduced as part of Biblical references are relatively unreliable.
