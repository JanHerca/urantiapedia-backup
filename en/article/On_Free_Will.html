<p>On Free Will</p>
<p>No other being, force, creator, or agency in all the wide universe of universes can interfere to any degree with the absolute sovereignty of the mortal free will, as it operates within the realms of choice, regarding the eternal destiny of the personality of the choosing mortal. As pertains to eternal survival, God has decreed the sovereignty of the material and mortal will, and that decree is absolute.</p>
<p>No personal creature can be coerced into the eternal adventure; the portal of eternity opens only in response to the freewill choice of the freewill sons of the God of free will.</p>
<p>The free will of man is supreme in moral affairs; even the indwelling Thought Adjuster refuses to compel man to think a single thought or to perform a single act against the choosing of manâ€™s own will.</p>
<p>When mind chooses a right moral judgment by an act of the free will, such a decision constitutes a religious experience.</p>
<p>Mortal man is endowed with free will, the power of choice, and though such choosing is not absolute, nevertheless, it is relatively final on the finite level and concerning the destiny of the choosing personality.</p>
<p>Man does not have unfettered free will; there are limits to his range of choice, but within the radius of this choice his will is relatively sovereign.</p>
