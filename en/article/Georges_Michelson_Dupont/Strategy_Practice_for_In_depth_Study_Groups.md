## Introduction

The purpose of this presentation is to share with you the experience accumulated over the years to animate and make attractive study groups and seminars. It is largely based on in-depth study and observation of revelator pedagogy.

1. First of all, I will recall the mandate to reveal entrusted to the revelators by the authorities of our universe.
2. Then I will analyze their strategy and the key points of their pedagogy.
3. I will continue this presentation by proposing an effective and attractive method to (a) interact creatively between participants; (b) going beyond the simple meaning of words to expand our mental framework and (c) bringing concepts down to the level of personal experience.
4. Finally, I will offer practical examples and make some recommendations to make the study group process effective and engaging.

The revelators have shown great knowledge of the workings of our minds in presenting revelation to us, expertise that we can use in study groups. In practice, the intensive study approach I suggest is best suited to readers who have read _The Urantia Book_ in its entirety. However, study groups can accommodate new readers who must first familiarize themselves with the teachings. It then becomes necessary to adapt the method to the circumstances.

### Why should we study _The Urantia Book_?

When you open _The Urantia Book_ to study, you have a “rendezvous” with God and the spiritual forces that conspire to help you “grasp the reality of spiritual values and to comprehend the philosophy of universe meanings.” This is not flowery rhetoric, this is an experiential reality: Do you realize its importance?

> 5\. _The Urantia Papers_. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. <a id="s29_138"></a>[UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9)

A Melchizedeck of Nebadon exhorts us to engage in the study of _The Urantia Book_:

> “It is not enough that the ascending mortal should know something of the relations of Deity to the genesis and manifestations of cosmic reality; he should also comprehend something of the relationships existing between himself and the numerous levels of existential and experiential realities, of potential and actual realities. Man's terrestrial orientation, his cosmic insight, and his spiritual directionization are all enhanced by a better comprehension of universe realities and their techniques of interassociation, integration, and unification.” <a id="s33_555"></a>[UB 106:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p0_1)

### The mandate to reveal

It is clearly identified and expressed in the second paragraph of the introduction by the Divine Counselor in these terms:

> “. . . expand cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception . . .” <a id="s39_77"></a>[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2)

This phrase introduces two concepts: "expanding cosmic consciousness" and "raising spiritual perception". We will decipher the meaning of each a little later, but already a Melchizedek of Nebadon describes this process as a technique:

> conjoint *revelational evolution.* <a id="s43_37"></a>[UB 196:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_15)

Behind this concept is a reality of experience: cooperation with the Thought Adjuster; the mind that wholeheartedly seeks to do the will of God and the Thought Adjuster that reveals the will of God and thus produces a dynamic of continuous mental expansion and spiritual upliftment.

This same Melchizedek states that:

> “Revelation teaches mortal man that, to start such a magnificent and intriguing adventure through space by means of the progression of time, he should begin by the organization of knowledge into idea-decisions; next, mandate wisdom to labor unremittingly at its noble task of transforming self-possessed ideas into increasingly practical but nonetheless supernal ideals, even those concepts which are so reasonable as ideas and so logical as ideals that the Adjuster dares so to combine and spiritize them as to render them available for such association in the finite mind as will constitute them the actual human complement thus made ready for the action of the Truth Spirit of the Sons, the time-space manifestations of Paradise truth—universal truth.” <a id="s49_758"></a>[UB 101:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_7)

“Expanding cosmic awareness” is an intellectual process that is in the realm of the mind while “raising spiritual awareness” is personal, experiential and subject to personality free will.

### Expand cosmic consciousness

#### Consciousness

Let's start by trying to define what consciousness or self-awareness is. The Universal Censor describes it as follows:

> “Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. Self-consciousness connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will.” <a id="s59_503"></a>[UB 16:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_6)

Self-awareness is therefore an intellectual phenomenon that allows experience with cosmic realities that are projected as an image in the mental frame. She is also able to establish individualized relationships with other personalities. The more the mental framework, the arena of choice, is illuminated by truth, the more meaningful the choices between value levels become.

#### Cosmic Consciousness

Again a Bright Evening Star offers us an explanation:

> “A real birth of cosmic consciousness takes place on mansonia number five. You are becoming universe minded. This is indeed a time of expanding horizons. It is beginning to dawn upon the enlarging minds of the ascending mortals that some stupendous and magnificent, some supernal and divine, destiny awaits all who complete the progressive Paradise ascension, which has been so laboriously but so joyfully and auspiciously begun. At about this point the average mortal ascender begins to manifest bona fide experiential enthusiasm for the Havona ascent. Study is becoming voluntary, unselfish service natural, and worship spontaneous. A real morontia character is budding; a real morontia creature is evolving.” <a id="s67_714"></a>[UB 47:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_5)

In spirit, the education which ascending mortals begin to undertake on mansonia 5 resembles that which the revelators provide to students of The Urantia Book. They expand our horizons by offering us a description of a stupendous and magnificent destiny on Paradise. We become excited about the prospect of progressing toward Havona, we truly desire to study willingly and to serve our brothers and sisters selflessly.

All of this is happening here on Urantia and not on mansonia #5. One can legitimately wonder whether we will go to mansonia #5 after being repersonalized on mansonia #1 and briefly crosses the other 4?

What an adventure !

### Enhance spiritual perception.

This is the second stage of the process; a little more mysterious than the first because it calls for a cooperative alchemy with the spiritual forces that inhabit or surround us. We have read previously that

> “. . . even those concepts which are so reasonable as ideas and so logical as ideals that the Adjuster dares so to combine and spiritize them as to render them available for such association in the finite mind as will constitute them the actual human complement thus made ready for the action of the Truth Spirit of the Sons, the time-space manifestations of Paradise truth—universal truth.” <a id="s79_394"></a>[UB 101:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_7)

We read :

> “Jesus taught the appeal to the emotions as the technique of arresting and focusing the intellectual attention. He designated the mind thus aroused and quickened as the gateway to the soul, where there resides that spiritual nature of man which must recognize truth and respond to the spiritual appeal of the gospel in order to afford the permanent results of true character transformations.” <a id="s83_395"></a>[UB 152:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p6_4)

And the Divine Counselor ends his introduction with

> “. . .  But we know that there dwells within the human mind a fragment of God, and that there sojourns with the human soul the Spirit of Truth; and we further know that these spirit forces conspire to enable material man to grasp the reality of spiritual values and to comprehend the philosophy of universe meanings. But even more certainly we know that these spirits of the Divine Presence are able to assist man in the spiritual appropriation of all truth contributory to the enhancement of the ever-progressing reality of personal religious experience—God-consciousness.” <a id="s87_577"></a>[UB 0:12.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_13)

## A Suggested Study Plan

The order in which the papers have been arranged and presented is not the result of chance but the result of deep reflection by the revelators. Although they do not tell us in a formal way where to start, we can nevertheless deduce precise indications from some of their reflections.

I personally find touching and remarkable the respectful way in which they show to suggest without ever imposing, always appealing to our reflection and encouraging us to improve our quality of thought and to speculate.

### Start with the Introduction.

In the Introduction our Divine Counselor brings the following reflection:

> “. . . there exists great confusion respecting the meaning of such terms as God, divinity, and deity. Human beings are still more confused and uncertain about the relationships of the divine personalities designated by these numerous appellations.” <a id="s99_251"></a>[UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1)

In fact, observation demonstrates that the apparent hermeticism of the language of The Urantia Book and the resulting ideational confusion repel many readers and become the most frequent cause of abandonment.

_It is therefore necessary to begin with an in-depth study of the introduction assisted by an experienced reader who can give loving and understanding support to the student or to the new reader._ The study of the following booklets will be much more interesting and will take much more of meanings.

Aware of this, the Divine Counselor warns us that

> “Because of this conceptual poverty associated with so much ideational confusion, I have been directed to formulate this introductory statement in explanation of the meanings which should be attached to certain word symbols as they may be hereinafter used in those papers which the Orvonton corps of truth revealers have been authorized to translate into the English language of Urantia.” <a id="s107_391"></a>[UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1)

In the Introduction, the Divine Counselor commits to:

1. _Clarifying_ terminology.
2. _Expand_ the meaning of certain words.
3. _Introduce_ new terms when language is not sufficient.
4. _Remove_ ambiguities and confusions.
5. _Develop_ concepts and explain relationships.

### Continue in the order presented.

It wouldn't occur to us to listen to a symphony starting at anything other than the beginning. _The Urantia Book_ is a symphony and should be enjoyed from the beginning. We want as proof of this the following clarification provided by the Divine Counselor.

> The human mind would ordinarily crave to approach the cosmic philosophy portrayed in these revelations by proceeding from the simple and the finite to the complex and the infinite, from human origins to divine destinies. But that path does not lead to *spiritual wisdom.* Such a procedure is the easiest path to a certain form of *genetic knowledge,* but at best it can only reveal man’s origin; it reveals little or nothing about his divine destiny. <a id="s121_453"></a>[UB 19:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_5)

> “Therefore, because of these and for still other reasons, do we employ the technique of approaching man and his planetary problems by embarkation on the time-space journey from the infinite, eternal, and divine Paradise Source and Center of all personality reality and all cosmic existence.” <a id="s123_294"></a>[UB 19:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_12)

This is therefore how the Revealers present the Papers, starting with God, the central universe and the superuniverses (Paper 1 to 31) then continuing at the level of the local universe (32 to 56), then at the level of our planet and its history (from 57 to 114) and finally by introducing our destiny (115 to 118).

This presentation is logical, coherent and progressive. It provides the student with increased intellectual understanding, strengthens faith and inspires the highest ideals. The revelators provide us with the elements that will allow "the expansion of our cosmic consciousness and the enhancement of our spiritual perception." It remains for us to undertake with enthusiasm and perseverance the in-depth study of the papers. The fourth part, the life and teachings of Jesus, will inspire the mind and nourish the soul with a re-reading of the gospel of Jesus and top it all off.

## The study group concept

By going to a study group, you are taking part in the spiritual feast prepared by divine personalities and sharing it with human personalities; heavenly food is abundant there, served with love and devotion by the various authors of The Urantia Book. Your Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth can then spiritualize these intellectual gains for your inspiration.

### What is a study group?

A Urantia Book study group consists of individuals willing to study and share in a fraternal and truth-seeking atmosphere the teachings in order to practice them in their daily lives.

The study group location should be conducive to study and sharing. The time and frequency of the study group should be fixed. It is desirable that the schedule is always consistent to avoid delays.

How long should a study group last? Many of them meet for about two hours once a week. The experience of our study group in France bears out that a full day of study can be very productive.

A study group should have a moderator and a “teacher,” preferably a long-time reader with good understanding of the book and with the skill to stimulate discussion.

The moderator or the teacher would do well to interview prospective attendees in order to determine their motivation for wanting to attend the study group.

Finally, rules approved by the members of the study group can be helpful. These rules might pertain to such matters as self-restraint with regard to dominating discussions.

### Why are study groups important?

Although religion is a personal experience, the natural outcomes are social.

The reading of The Urantia Papers by oneself is certainly important as an introduction to the teachings of the book but usually thereafter comes the desire to meet with other readers to share “the pearl of great price.” Most readers feel the need to expand their understanding and to share their intellectual perspectives and spiritual lives in a friendly and private venue.

Urantia Book study groups are essential for at least the following reasons:

- _Study groups_ are the place where religionists can share their faith with others and can build the social brotherhood of believers by intimate association. The progress of one study group attendee can benefit the other attendees, and the progress of the group can benefit each member of the group.  One for all and all for one.
- _Study groups_ offer a friendly and secure environment to welcome new readers and to study the book with other readers.
- _Study groups_ are a place where team spirit is fostered and where creative teamwork is exercised.
- _Study groups_ develop a dynamic for growth, a cross-fertilizing of ideas and ideals conducive for training teachers and leaders.
- _Study groups_ are needed, if not essential, for a secure dissemination of the Urantia Revelation worldwide.
- _Study groups_ represent the next progressive stage in the evolution of religion. This next progressive stage, which moves beyond sectarian institutionalization led by trained clergy who administer religious doctrines, is revealed in _The Urantia Book_: each personality is a child of God with the gifted and indwelt ability to directly experience and perceive religious truth and spiritual values.

### Study Group Leaders and Teachers

Teachers and leaders are long-time experienced individuals with the teachings and doctrines of _The Urantia Book_, wise individuals who desire to serve the readership without imposing their point of view. In no way are these individuals “gurus” or “masters” with self-appointed authority seeking for personal aggrandizement or a paid position. Their motivation is a natural result of having found God and having acquired the desire to be of service.

> “Religious desire is the hunger quest for divine reality. Religious experience is the realization of the consciousness of having found God. And when a human being does find God, there is experienced within the soul of that being such an indescribable restlessness of triumph in discovery that he is impelled to seek loving service-contact with his less illuminated fellows, not to disclose that he has found God, but rather to allow the overflow of the welling-up of eternal goodness within his own soul to refresh and ennoble his fellows. Real religion leads to increased social service.” <a id="s166_592"></a>[UB 102:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_4)

During the study, it is quite natural for the teacher to give his interpretation according to his understanding of this or that passage of the _Urantia Book_. But this is not the right method because in doing so, the teacher interprets the author's thought at the risk of imposing a partial, subjective, inaccurate or even erroneous point of view. In truth, all of the clarifications, expansions of concepts, and answers to participants' legitimate questions are in the book itself, and the correct method is for the teacher to seek them out and use them as "cross-references" c ie paragraphs or passages bringing a clarification in the terminology, presenting an additional point of view, enhancing an ideal, or deepening such or such concept. This is precisely the technique remarkably used by revelators to expand our cosmic consciousness and expand our mental framework.

A well-chosen cross-reference in the context of a given sharing can really clarify and even deeply enhance the spiritual perception of the participants. For example, in the sentence: “This magnificent and universal injunction to strive for the perfection of divinity is the first duty and should be the highest ambition of all creatures who struggle in the creation of the God of perfection . . .” <a id="s170_398"></a>[UB 1:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_4) the term "duty" offended some participants and I knew in advance that it would be a source of discussion. The Divine Counselor uses the term duty here to make us reflect on our responsibility to obey this injunction. By choosing to refer to Paper 117, Section 4 we have truly received from the Mighty Messenger a masterly, clear and significant answer of our responsibility not only as a child of the Universal Father but also towards the members of God the Sevenfold. Some participants experienced a very strong spiritual emotion and this "duty" which had remained at the level of the intellect really rose to the spiritual level of sincere desire and recognition of personal responsibility.

This is the preparatory work that a teacher must do before the meeting. Always remember that it is the authors of _The Urantia Book_ who "reveal" the higher truths by bringing their superhuman point of view and therefore it is their writings to which we must be exposed and not listen to the interpretation of a teacher no matter how good and relevant.

The other benefit of cross-referencing comes from exposing participants to first-hand learnings. They learn to "search" in the book when they are isolated or at home.

## Study groups are for whom?

It is an error to believe that _Urantia Book_ study groups are only for highly educated people. Experience shows that by using a coherent study plan, a gentle and progressive method, assisted by an experienced and dedicated teacher, within a friendly study group, the student simply has to show motivation, determination and open-mindedness. Naturally we will assume that he has already found God: this is the first condition for any participation in a study group. However, we must admit that not everyone is ready to embark with courage and discipline on such an exhilarating and transformative adventure. Nevertheless, it should be the ambition and goal of any study group to be able to provide this opportunity.

Remember that God only reveals himself to his children at the times they _wholeheartedly_ desire to know him regardless of their education. It is a relationship of love between two personalities and not an intellectual accomplishment.

## The study group strategy

A methodical and serious approach to the teachings of The Urantia Book is essential for the growth of cosmic consciousness and the spiritual enhancement of participants. However, even if the revelators work to correct erroneous notions, gather and coordinate otherwise known ideas and present new concepts, they do so in a language whose extreme linguistic precision and ideational correctness we do not always conceive. . Thus, many things that are exposed to us remain obscure because we have trouble grasping their conceptual content.

We must therefore undertake a real intellectual work of clarification, understanding and sharing and it is mainly in a study group that we can do this work with the help of an experienced teacher/reader.

The teacher must use a method that transforms the reader into a student, actor of his discoveries and apply a strategy that provokes intellectual attraction, creates a dynamic of progression, stimulates reflection and stirs up the desire to share. This is the difference between a reading group and a study group. The latter has a method, a strategy and a program.

To be effective, the meeting must be prepared in advance by the teacher. He will therefore have to read and identify before the meeting the terms to be explained, the ideas to be explored in the text of the revealers and to make a list of them. He will also have to choose his cross-references which will shed light on the concepts presented by the authors in another way.

### The method

There is a difference between a reader group and a study group. A successful study group is based on the following principles:

1. Questioning,
2. Sharing,
3. From concepts to experience.
4. Cross–referencing.

We will analyze these four elements later in the presentation.

### Questioning

After the reading of paragraphs, the leader-facilitator might ask questions to stimulate discussion.

- _Questioning_ transforms a passive reader into an active seeker and makes it easier for the Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth to participate.
- _Questioning_ is non-invasive, non-coercive, non-destructive,  non-interpretive, and quite Jesusonian. It is respectful of participant’s free will and does not force nor control the mind.
- _Questioning_ has the potential to open the mind to a new perspective.
- _Questioning_ encourages sharing and brotherhood.
- _Questioning_ enhances the possibility that the study group members will discover answers for and by themselves.

### Questioning about what?

A Melchizedek of Nebadon stated the following:

> “Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology.” <a id="s217_165"></a>[UB 101:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)
> 
> “While statements with reference to cosmology are never inspired, such revelations are of immense value in that they at least transiently clarify knowledge by:
> 
> 1. The reduction of confusion by the authoritative elimination of error.
> 2. The co-ordination of known or about-to-be-known facts and observations.
> 3. The restoration of important bits of lost knowledge concerning epochal transactions in the distant past.
> 4. The supplying of information which will fill in vital missing gaps in otherwise earned knowledge.
> 5. Presenting cosmic data in such a manner as to illuminate the spiritual teachings contained in the accompanying revelation” <a id="s225_128"></a>[UB 101:4.5-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_10)

So here is the strategy they have put in place for the expansion of our cosmic consciousness. These 5 points constitute a taxonomy of teaching which will constitute a grid on which our questioning will be based.

In preparing for the meeting, the teacher will be keen to research the questions that the participants will ask themselves in

### Sharing

“Spiritual growth is mutually stimulated by intimate association with other religionists. Love supplies the soil for religious growth.” <a id="s233_136"></a>[UB 100:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p0_2)

1. The _sharing_ of answers and the exchanging of ideas 1) provides for opportunities to hear other points of view, and 2) promotes good will.
2. The _sharing_ of spiritual matters and experiences with others, combined with the support of the Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth, fosters soul growth.
3. The _sharing_ of personal interpretations enhances comprehension of the material.
4. _Sharing_ enhances the interest and holds the attention of study group attendees. In addition, the spiritual presence of our unseen friends, our Thought Adjusters, and the Spirit of Truth contributes to effecting a spiritual transformation, and participants are not tired at the end of the day.

### From Concepts to Experience

Recall that in the second paragraph on page 1 of the Foreword, a Divine Counselor states that the purpose of _The Urantia Book_ is “to expand cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception.” The expansion of cosmic consciousness is more intellectual in nature. And often we lose the significance of intellectual concepts because we do not connect them with our day-to-day life. During study group discussions, the study group leader-facilitator should do his or her best to associate the intellectual concepts with the real life of the study group attendees by bringing the teachings to the experiential level.

To illustrate this approach, let us take the following example: The concept of “mind spiritualization” is somewhat vague. 

First, using thought-provoking questions, the leader-facilitator brings the study group attendees to the realization that mind spiritualization involves a day-to-day exercise of choice between the egoism of the animal nature and the altruism of spiritual nature, between the impulses of the animal nature and the meanings and values of the spiritual nature.

Once the concept is connected to his everyday life, it becomes a reality of experience. The teacher will then endeavor to expand the concept of the personal level of experience to the universal level of meaning by discussing the repercussions and the cosmic responsibility he now bears to his Thought Adjuster, for the growth of the sovereignty of Jesus in his local universe, for the superuniverse sovereignty of the Supreme Being and for the Supremacy in general. Finally giving a name to this process "The Supremacy".

## Cross-referencing

To illustrate a concept or otherwise illuminate a particular concept, it is sometimes necessary to refer to other paragraphs scattered throughout The Urantia Book. This is what I call the crossing of ideas. The English call this concept "cross-fertilizing" which is difficult to translate into French because in addition to the idea of crossing, it incorporates the notion of fertilization, that is to say the possibility of producing a third idea improved by relation to the two parent ideas.

For instance, the following paragraph explains the survival technique, but the complexity of the terminology makes the paragraph somewhat difficult to understand.

> In the inner experience of man, mind is joined to matter. Such material-linked minds cannot survive mortal death. The technique of survival is embraced in those adjustments of the human will and those transformations in the mortal mind whereby such a God-conscious intellect gradually becomes spirit taught and eventually spirit led. This evolution of the human mind from matter association to spirit union results in the transmutation of the potentially spirit phases of the mortal mind into the morontia realities of the immortal soul. Mortal mind subservient to matter is destined to become increasingly material and consequently to suffer eventual personality extinction; mind yielded to spirit is destined to become increasingly spiritual and ultimately to achieve oneness with the surviving and guiding divine spirit and in this way to attain survival and eternity of personality existence. <a id="s256_899"></a>[UB 1:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_7)

After the above paragraph has been read, the leader-facilitator might facilitate understanding of the paragraph by cross-referencing as follows:

“Those adjustments of the human will” refers to the innate capacity of choice of the personality’s free-will between the relative right and wrong. By reading  <a id="s260_159"></a>[UB 16:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_4), one finds additional explanation of the mechanism of the Cosmic Mind in personality. Also, by reading  <a id="s260_305"></a>[UB 16:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_7), one finds the different situations in which the free will of the personality is involved:

“Those transformations in the mortal mind” refers to the acceptance of the mortal mind to cooperate with the Thought Adjuster through repetitive choice of right versus wrong, the altruistic urge versus the egoistic inclination. In Paper 110, section 3 <a id="s262_252"></a>[UB 110:3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3), a Solitary Messenger explains how to improve cooperation with the Thought Adjuster and in 111:1 <a id="s262_389"></a>[UB 111:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1). It dissects the mental framework in which personality choices are made.

“The transmutation of the potentially spirit phases of the mortal mind into the morontia realities of the immortal soul” refers to the mechanism used by the Thought Adjuster to transfer the spiritual content of human thoughts to the morontia soul. <a id="s264_248"></a>[UB 1:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_7) <a id="s264_288"></a>[UB 108:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_5)

## Preparing for a Study Group

### Preparing for the meeting

The in-depth study of the Urantia Revelation, like the study of anything, requires self-discipline on the part of the study group attendees and especially the leader-facilitator.

Well before the meeting of the study group, the leader-facilitator has some homework to do:

He identifies and prepares

1. The preparation of several thought-provoking and stimulating questions.
2. The preparation of a list of words to be explained during the meeting of the study group.
3. The selection of cross-referenced paragraphs related to the material to be studied.
4. The preparation of a list of intellectual concepts to be discussed.
5. The recommendation that attendees read the text in advance and write down questions and comments.

### Functioning of the Study Group

A well-organized and administered study group has written rules of conduct accepted by all of the members. In some cases, and especially with newcomers, it is advisable to read them tactfully before starting.

The principle of in-depth study is the systematic reading, in turn, of each paragraph followed by a period of questions, discussions and sharing, led by the teacher, during which everyone has the opportunity to express themselves.

Then, the teacher leads the discussion using the questions he will have prepared based on the grid of 5 elements as well as the cross-references which will clarify or amplify the humanization of the concepts. The interventions are not limited in time but the teacher will ensure that they do not drift. He must ensure that each participant has the opportunity to express themselves without monopolizing the floor.

With the help of the leader-facilitator:

- Terminology is clarified.
- Ideas are discussed.
- Concepts are analyzed and expanded with the aid of cross-references when appropriate.
- Study group attendees share their personal experiences in such a way as “to expand cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception.”

### The Agenda of the Study Group

The study group starts with two or three minutes of meditative silence at the end of which one of the attendees might say or pray something to end the meditation.

Optionally a participant can say a few words of appreciation and gratitude to the Spirit on behalf of the group.

Then, a moderator is designated. The moderator’s role is to designate who will speak and to ensure that each attendee has the opportunity to speak.

The leader-facilitator invites someone to read the first paragraph and to continue reading until someone has a question or comment or the leader-facilitator has a question. All the attendees are encouraged to participate in the discussion or with their questions or comments, ensuring that they are not interrupted while ensuring that the conversation does not deviate.

Then, he asks questions in order to stimulate reflection, to go beyond words to begin the work of study and deepening. The cross-references are read, discussed and then come to answer the questions.

In the order in which the participants are seated, the teacher takes turns giving the floor for the reading and so on.

Have a 15 minutes recess in the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Some examples of questions and comments

Recall that the developers use more than 1,000 human concepts.

> _The reduction of confusion by the authoritative elimination of error._ <a id="s317_74"></a>[UB 101:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_6)

The following quote from the Bible contains an error. _“It is_ by _the Son_ that _God_ created the _universe_, and _it is_ to him that he assigned the ownership of all things. »

It is authoritatively corrected by the following sentence: “. . . It is by the Sons of God that the universes were made. . . ". <a id="s321_128"></a>[UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)

> “The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive, a philosophy unworthy of an enlightened age of science and truth.” [LU 4:5.4](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_4)

The Divine Counselor here denounces the Christian dogma of the death of Christ on the cross for the remission of the sins of men.

How does the following quote shed light on spiritual teachings?

The Divine Counselor unveils the transcendent purpose of the universe that science cannot formulate in order to place man in a context of cosmic brotherhood illuminating his personal and spiritual relationship with God, his Father and his loving creator.

## Conclusion

My purpose in writing this article was to offer you some ideas and techniques based on my years of experience leading study groups and seminars.

I wanted to give you some ideas as to how to make a study group successful and inviting—an place where study group attendees enjoy sharing, discussing, finding mutual inspiration, and building human brotherhood.

On page 17, a Divine Counselor states the following: “In making these presentations about God and his universe associates, we have selected as the basis of these papers more than one thousand human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings.” <a id="s341_314"></a>[UB 0:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_12)

The revelatory commission delivered the best possible revelation, long before the day of its world-wide mission, with the hope that individuals would be attracted and transformed and would become the living disseminators of the teachings worldwide. Are we apostles, disciples, actors, or just spectators of the fifth epochal revelation? It belongs to each of us to find an answer to this question in conformity with our personal motivation and desire to participate in this extraordinary adventure.

We who are exposed to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ must be actively involved in our communities of readers. It becomes our responsibility to foster and promote a worldwide proliferation of efficient and attractive study groups wherever and whenever we can, but the question is: How do we do it?

When looking at living human cells, we observe that they multiply by division. A study group is like a cell; when the study group attendees number more than, say, 12 or 13, it is the time for a division. By the time a study group reaches its “critical mass,” teachers, leaders, and facilitators need to start a new study group. Indeed, study groups are like sacks of grain; until the grain seed is disseminated, no harvest is possible.

Finally, study groups are the crucibles for the establishment of communities of believers from which the gospel of Jesus—the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man—will spread out into the world.

Thank you all.
