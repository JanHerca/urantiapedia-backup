_The Urantia Book_ Internet School (UBIS) is pleased to announce that the April trimester is starting soon, and we want you to join us!

Registration opens on Monday, April 4, and runs for two weeks through Sunday, April 17. The free online courses start on Monday, April 18, and will run for ten weeks.

You may visit http://www.urantia.org/education/course-schedule-and-registration-information to read about the courses and the Teacher/Facilitators. You may also visit https://ubis.urantia.org and select the desired language to view the April selection.

If you are not yet a student of UBIS, it is easy to enroll. Simply go to https://ubis.urantia.org and click on Login in the upper right hand side of the page. Look for Is this your first time here? Then follow the steps, and click on Create New Account. You will receive an email notification.

This trimester we are offering a total of thirteen courses-six in English, three in French, three in Spanish, and one in Portuguese. UBIS classes do not require attendance at any fixed time. Our virtual classrooms are open 24 / 7 so students may participate according to their own schedule. Space is limited so don't wait too long to register!
