Carol Cannon, U.S.A. 

I think you all know where I'm going with this. We're all saying essentially the same thing this weekend, but in all of our diverse ways. We could just go into a deep meditation now and save ourselves a lot of time and talk, but I'll try to be quick, so here is my one minute overview:

**It is my belief that we humans, two-legged two-brained creatures, are designed and born to feel and express joy on an on-going basis and that is the Father's will for us.**

**Through** these very physical apparatus we call our bodies, **especially** at this current time, not only in our culture's history, but also astro-physically where we are in space, along with our increasing understanding of how quantum physics works, we have everything we need to have a full-time joyous experience, even while presented with the task of dreaming this adolescent world into Light and Life.

How we manage our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual energies with this new knowledge opens unlimited capacity for creativity and the wherewithal to configure a new society from the inside out: manifesting a quantum leap for our planet.

Okay, here we are: I now have less than 20 minutes to cover a lot of mental ground, but ultimately it is my intention to affirm your access to innate joy instantaneously at all times and explain why **this is our first duty**.

But I'm going to ask **you** for **three** things first: Will you relax and listen carefully and follow the logic with your valves wide open, just letring the words and concepts wash over you?

And secondly, would you all be willing, while I count to three, to take a deep breath and then exhale a big sigh through your mouth?

Okay? One, two three—and let it—aaahhhh.

Now, please, sense how solidly you are grounded in your chairs, think and **feel** for a moment how fantastic it is that we are gravitationally held not only by the center of the earth but **through** the center of the earth to the center of the system, and so on through to the Father's abode experiencing just enough atmospheric pressure to neither float away, be sucked violently out into space, **nor** be crushed right into the earth by too much gravitational force. We have movement at will!

Contemplate the miracle of being an individual personality with an eternal life span, sitting here in the Wagner College Theater, on Staten **Island**, New York, one of the United States, on planet number 606 named Urantia in the twenty-fourth system named Satania within the seventieth constellation of Norlatiadek, in the local universe of Nebadon, in the third minor sector called Ensa, inside the fifth major sector Splandon of the superuniverse Orvonton, the seventh segment of the Grand Universe rotating counterclockwise in the Master Universe!

I still cannot get over the wonder that there is a **center**—a gravitational center—to it all physically, mindally and spiritually, pulling us inward, only to probably shoot us out again!

Okay, you're saying: “Where's the beef?” You want to know about the quantum physics part of this equation. Let me go back to the phrase “configure a new society from the inside out.” Not only do I refer to “first casting the beam out of our own eyes so that we may see better to cast the mote out of our brother's eye,” but also I refer to understanding what is the inside of this out. And how do we **interface** with this Infinite Inside of Everything and Everyone? What is the inside comprised of in terms of our operating system, our genetic make-up, and how and why are we basically designed as a radionics device, able to send and receive complex forms of energy and thought? Let me remind you of what to me is one of the most amazing statements that _The Urantia Book_ makes in a completely incidental manner on 42:1.2:

> _Matter—energy—for they are but diverse manifestations of the same cosmic reality, as a universe phenomenon is inherent in the Universal Father. “In Him all things consist.” Matter may appear to manifest inherent energy and to exhibit self-contained powers, but the lines of gravity involved in the energies concerned in these physical phenomena are derived from, and are dependent on, Paradise. The ultimaton, the first measurable form of energy, has Paradise as its nucleus._ <a id="a66_480"></a>[[UB 42:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p1_2)]


So what else can we deduce from that but that at the very heart of every little thing and every big somebody(no matter how they appear to be behaving) - is absolute pure love!

I think you might appreciate it now if I finally define the terms of my title: (1) Quantum Physics: What exactly does **quantum** mean?

_The Oxford Dictionary_ refers back to 1910, stating: “A discrete **unit** quantity of energy proportional to the frequency of radiation emitted from or absorbed by an atom.” And further: “Quantum Theory, the hypothesis that in radiation the energy of the electrons is discharged in discrete amounts or quanta.” So basically, quantum is a **unit** of measurement, a particle—but then there is this frustrating and magical quality that characterizes the whole field and which liberates us so dramatically, and that is the waveparticle duality—is the fundamental unit of matter a wave or a solid particle? Is it light?

And when they study light, they discover the same paradox: light behaves like a wave **and** a particle. Another definition I have read about light is that it is a wave packet of information—energy **in** formation—energy information! Are our eyes and brains not ingeniously designed to perceive and interpret light? This stimulates two of the master glands: the pineal gland (or third eye) and the hypothalamus, which controls most of the body's regulatory systems and which interfaces between the mind and body, affecting our entire consciousness.

But before I get ahead of the logic here, I want to mention that Erwin Schrodinger developed the wave equation for matter and thus began quantum **mechanics**. I quote from Dr. Amit Goswami's book The Self-Aware Universe. On page 35:

> The music of the atom, its wave pattern, is the same wherever you find it—on Earth or Andromeda. Furthermore, the stationary pattern, depending only on the conditions of its confinement, has no trace of history, no memory; it generates itself, repeating the same performance over and over.

Then we are led to understand that electrons are really wave **packets** and that these are clusters of **probability**! Everything around us, including ourselves, is a cluster of probability? Do they mean it's just a fantastic coincidence that we wake up as the , same person and all of this continues to stick together out of a mere **chance**?

(Remember, Goswami just said that the wave particle has no trace of history nor memory—so what is it that makes up the consistency in matter? What holds these patterns together?)

When scientists attempt to observe subatomic particles, they cannot define or measure anything until their very own perceptions, or even their expectations, “solidify” what they are observing. I quote from Goswami's book again:

> If we want to measure the electron's change, we must intercept it with something like a cloud of vapor, as in a cloud chamber. As a result of this measurement, we must assume that the electron's wave collapses, so now we are able to see the electron's track through the cloud of vapor. According to Heisenberg. The path of the electron comes into existence only when we observe it. When we measure it, we always find the electron localized as a particle. We may say that our measurement reduces the electron wave to the particle state?

So this to me suggests a very fluid field at play—one where the basic unifying factor is one of perception, expectation—but who's doing that level of observation?

An over-riding pattern of mind so grand that we strain to get our minds around the underlying idea that there is a pervading purpose and creative plan compelling the nature of reality on all of its interwoven and infinitesimally subtle levels.

I postulate that a fundamental drive in consciousness is what creates order on all levels—from the Father down and his initial, etemal intention could be summed up by the Latin expression: _summum bonum_ (the chief or supreme good) The Highest Good for All. In the realm of time and space it's my guess that our very personalities, as expressions of God's infinite personality, generate the underlying pattern and intention around and through which our souls find expression and order the DNA of our physical manifestations and uphold this incomprehensible web of relationships. But the really exciting part is that we have free will and have input (or not) into this river of intention for _summun bonum_. So the task in my mind is again to understand the dynamics of interfacing with this potential in order to play our parts in this fantastic drama of creating within the Supreme, the Ultimate, and the Absolute!

Why not?

When I first started reading _The Urantia Book__at age 15, I thought the job was to fuse, get out of the body, off the planet, and onto much more important matters. I gave it around 10 years, not realizing the importance of living out a full mortal life. And so I came to accept, okay, I'm here to experience, feeling the seams of my soul stretching, but now I feel far less separated from the etheric world I yearned to join or return to because I've learned that **through** this incredible apparatus of the human body and the perfect quantum device, the brain, I now understand my access to the subtler levels of the master universe that are available to me. I merely have to more skillfully learn finer attunement skills—the bandwidth that we can avail ourselves of even now is far greater than we've been lead to believe—and even _The Urantia Book_'s jokes about our limitations don't credit the vastness that has been given to us, even in this so-called limited bundle of electro-chemical mechanical reactions.

Another crucial principle in quantum physics that supports my postulate is that when two wave patterns interact with one another, a third pattern is generated called an interference pattern, which is a an entirely unique pattern onto itself with a whole new frequency and in some way greater than the so-called sum of its parts. The old pebble in the pond example: when one pebble tossed into a pond sets off a ripple effect and interacts with the ripple effect of a second pebble's wave pattern, one witnesses a third phenomenon which illustrates this entirely original frequency pattern—with entirely unique peaks and troughs at different intervals than either of the two wave patterns from the two original pebbles.

This third or interference wave pattern is the new form.

Would you kindly think now of what scientists have developed as laser beams, extremely coherent forms of light that are ideal for creating interference patterns. Well, guess what I'm going to say? Yes, each of us has the perfect interference-pattern-maker within us—that funny power called the human will. When applied consciously and responsibly to whatever ails uspersonally or societally—that laser beam of consciousness dreaming up what it is we desire most for our lives can cause true, beautiful, and good interference patterns to arise and now, more powerfully and more quickly than ever before. It is up to us to emerge from the enslavement of mere cause and effect material “realism” and utilize this more efficient and fun way of living based on:

**Resonant causation**: We can literally change the world from our beds or meditation pillows or wherever you find the quiet to concentrate and cultivate the brainwave patterns that act as laser beams upon wave patterns of matter—be it a self-defeating behavior pattern or an outmoded medical system, political process, educational philosophy or polluted planet.

And a great way to see how stuck we are (and the status quo would prefer we remain so) is to remember an Indian trick to catch monkeys: The hunters secure jars with chick peas to a tree, and when the monkey grabs the chick peas, he can't get his hand out because his fist is now too big; but he won't let go of the chick peas and is therefore trapped. So like the monkey, we ought to let go of our outmoded ways of thinking based on pure cause and effect in the material world and grab hold of these quantum principles with our underutilized holographic brains and use marvelous imagery like that which _The Urantia Book_ gives us in papers such as “Government on a Neighboring Planet” or better yet the “Spheres of Light and Life.” Using this imagery we can generate interference patterns of new forms in our personal and global lives, up-stepping this long and arduous evolutionary process.

If you remember earlier I mentioned that right now is a particularly powerful and fertile time and will continue to be based on our astro-physical positioning. And why? One reason is because of something called the photon band-detected in 1961 by satellite-borne instruments. Let me better explain **photon** for a minute: “a photon is a quantum of electromagnetic energy with zero mass—no electrical charge and an indefinitely long lifetime.” It is comprised of two quanta of light—an electron and the anti-particle or positron—the two ultimately collide, creating a photon. We are currently being showered (and impulsed or catalyzed) by these activating photons as we move through this particular segment of the Milky Way simultaneous to our becoming aware of the vertical direction of our link-up through the system capital and so on. This is why we are literally in the Information Age—the age of light (photons) is gaining on us whether we're going willingly into it or resisting it and holding onto those chick peas!

So now I can more comfortably come around to defining joy. I don't need to tell you what it feels like, but I can support the argument that in our search to do the Father's will, the more we cultivate pure joy in our lives and our bodies, the more we will be performing our “duty” by activating God's light in this time-space matrix—and the big surprise is that it is this radionics device by which we achieve that kind of fusion! Many of you may be familiar with Dr. Christianne Northrop who frequently speaks on Public Television. In her willingness to speak her truth she states: “We are wired for ecstasy.”

I'm sure most of you are also familiar with the energy centers radiating through the body from our base of the spine to the top of the brain. It's funny how I never appreciated the meaning of kundalini until I accepted that the fluid in the nerves is the medium through which light travels in our bodies. We have at least eight different subtle energy systems in the body. And because of the increase of photonic activity in our atmosphere, our bodies are being activated through that resonant causation I explained: we're being vibrated right out of our old forms, releasing emotional baggage and the past. So there's how we remove the beam out of our own eye: we find out where the fear and resistance is held in our own nervous system from whatever conditioning didn't support our sense of wholeness. We check out what energy center is holding the memory, the damaged DNA, and we attend to healing and clearing that so the light and joy fills in and passes up and out. Then we can better remove the mote out of our brother's eye because it's like when one tuning fork is vibrating at so many megahertz, the next is going to be triggered (by resonant causation, I might add) to vibrate at the same rate.

The power of your personal healing field is directly proportional to the power of your love. And speaking of megahertz, the scientists who have studied the field of sentics (the branch of science discovering how “nature's dynamic communicative forms [emotions] function in man with precision and power”) have actually measured the frequency of the body when experiencing different feelings, just as other scientists have measured the core of the earth's vibration. The human body during the day vibrates between 72- 90 megahertz, and while experiencing joy it goes to about 115. Currently geologists have measured the frequency of the core of the earth and notice that it is vibrating faster than it was two decades ago. So some suspect that this photonic activity that we are enjoying is affecting all minerals, plants, and animals.

So I have come to learn and accept and see that _The Urantia Book_ clearly explains that in terms of quantum physics, our energy centers are vortices—vortexes that transduce energy—and the more we clear and strengthen the nervous sys the more we increase our capacity to transmit this joy that resides—where does it reside? At the very center of Paradise—the very center of each and every atom that comprises us, the heart of creation, our hearts, open channels flowing with this river of unadulterated joy. The more we align, identify, and resonate with our Infinite Source, the more we do his will.

And when you think of the scale of personalities that make up God the Sevenfold, the Seven Master Spirits, even the seven superuniverses, and when you perceive them as vortices—down-stepping immeasurable megahertz of Energy, Light, Information, or Joy—and when you think of them as the energy centers or chakras of God the Supreme, you can easily imagine that he is the vortex through which the absonite and absolute are channeling their intention! So why don't we focus on clearing the miraculous radio transmitter and receivers that we have been blessed with so our Thought Adjuster can better supply us with the leading we can use to create Heaven on Earth, fusing with joy along the way.
