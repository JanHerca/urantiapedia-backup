> Glorious Father and Mother, in one parent combined,
> Loyal would we be to your divine nature.
> Your own self to live again in and through us
> By the gift and bestowal of your divine spirit,
> Thus reproducing you imperfectly in this sphere
> As you are perfectly and majestically shown on high.
> Give us day by day your sweet ministry of brotherhood
> And lead us moment by moment in the pathway of loving service.
> Be you ever and unfailingly patient with us
> Even as we show forth your patience to our children.
> Give us the divine wisdom that does all things well
> And the infinite love that is gracious to every creature.
> Bestow upon us your patience and loving-kindness
> That our charity may enfold the weak of the realm.
> And when our career is finished, make it an honor to your name,
> A pleasure to your good spirit, and a satisfaction to our soul helpers.
> Not as we wish, our loving Father, but as you desire the eternal good of your mortal children,
> Even so may it be. <a id="a53_21"></a>[UB 144:5.55-72](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_55)
