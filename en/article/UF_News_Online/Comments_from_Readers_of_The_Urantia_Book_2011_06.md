Inspiring Words from a Reader of _The Urantia Book_

_By Jim Watkins, Cape Coral, Florida, USA_

When I was 16, I begged God to show me the truth. I told Him I wasn't afraid to know it if He would only show me the way. At the age of 19, I discovered _The Urantia Book_, and I have been discovering it ever since. Thirty years later, I have come to realize that I am the luckiest person on earth. Our Father, through the tireless efforts of his spirit children, our unseen friends, has entrusted me with this latest revelation of religious truth.

Ponder for a moment what we have been given: a glimpse into the heavens, a peek through the keyhole of the door to a living and vibrant universe, filled with spirit beings who so lovingly watch and care over us in the name of our heavenly Father who has made all of this possible. These are the truths contained within the pages of _The Urantia Book_.

I thank our spirit cousins bringing this revelation into my life and for making it possible for me to know and love God and to learn something of His entire spiritual family of which I am a proud and dedicated member.

To be so very fortunate as to live at this time, and to be among the first human beings to have been given this revelation - it is as if I have won the spiritual lottery.

I only hope _The Urantia Book_ will be as transformative in your life as it has been in mine.

## The Story of a Long Time Urantia Book Reader

_By Bill Martin, Niles, Michigan, USA._

Spending my formative years as a teen in a study group composed almost entirely of Forum members and second-generation students was a fertile greenhouse for the cultivation of my embryonic soul. Answers to my questions were in-depth and often far above my understanding, but perseverance furthered my capacity to comprehend and now, forty-some years later, I am still a student, in that same room, answering sincere questions from other truth -hungry souls. The relationships forged over the years in this study group will always be a part of me. They are some of what my Thought Controller and Guardian will use in my reassembly on Mansonia One.

Over time, I have learned that conceptual knowledge is no substitute for spiritual fruit in living life. We must “_learn to water the garden of [our] hearts as well as seek for the dry sands of knowledge._” <a id="a55_207"></a>[UB 48:6.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_32) We must refresh our souls with the water of life and forgive our debtors, as we have been forgiven. Every soul, however humble, has their story to tell. Our Father loves all His children equally and unconditionally, and Divine Love reveals the nature of God and makes us real and more replete.

A personal and living revelation, above and beyond the pages of a book, has made real to me the teachings that a soul of immortal and well-nigh unlimited potential is being forged out in my Mind Arena of Choice. “_The acts of today are the destiny of tomorrow_.” <a id="a57_263"></a>[UB 48:7.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_26)

The Father of Lights has entered my mind to elevate, transform and transfigure it with a fragment of the purest spirit realty in the universe who will eternalize my temporal identity that I may “strike step” with the progressive procession of eternity.

One thing has become crystal clear: unselfish and unselfconscious labor for your fellows, particularly beings in need and distress, is the real measure of planetary greatness. “One must do something as well as be something.” <a id="a61_225"></a>[UB 115:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p0_1)

> “Service is the goal of time and the destination of space.” <a id="a63_62"></a>[UB 28:6.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_19)
