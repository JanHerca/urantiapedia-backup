## What does _The Urantia Book_ mean to me?

How can I briefly answer this question when the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ have been a daily living reality within me? I have been using them in my daily spiritual service to my brothers and sisters for close to 11 years now. The book has been an amazing blessing!

When I came to _The Urantia Book_ while still involved in a Fourth Way school, a school of consciousness, I felt right away that the content of this book would give me the answers to all my existential questions and much more. And so it did, so much so that, for me, it became the “wow” book. Page after page, I was filled with amazement, from the nature of God, our Father, all the way to the last page of the book where the greatest challenge of man on earth is explained.

Through that month and a half that the first reading of the book took me, I was fully immersed each day all day from morning to late in the night in the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, connecting the dots of the cosmic puzzle. And through that period, I was touched by the grace of God when He allowed me to feel Him with all my being and made me perceive that e was and is truly my Father, our Universal Father, a person that I can relate to person to person. Wow! And not only is He my Father, but His Divine Presence, a perfect guide, a fragment of Himself, is within me, lives within me so we can ultimately be one. Wow!

May our Father continue to bless each of you abundantly.

## Quiet?

Our days are often crowded with the activities of necessity: family, work, play. We seem to be bombarded by the clanging of multi-media (distracting us) supposedly keeping us “informed.” Yes, there is much to be aware of and stay alert to. Yes, busy, busy people - busy, busy planet.

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” <a id="a49_168"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)

As this amazing epoch unfolds before us, with its heightened energy, it becomes evident to me that one must, with purpose, seek out that which is seemingly elusive: the Still, the Quiet.

This Stillness - this “Quiet” - is essential to our personal growth. “Quiet meditation...” <a id="a53_91"></a>[UB 136:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p3_3), “to pray...amidst the quiet surroundings...” <a id="a53_181"></a>[UB 144:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p3_14), “...peace, be quiet...” <a id="a53_252"></a>[UB 151:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p5_5), “...a period of quiet and rest...” <a id="a53_332"></a>[UB 156:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_3). Additionally, our mission work as students and teachers of the Truth, Beauty and Goodness we fondly embrace in the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, is to be performed in a quiet manner.

Repeatedly we are reminded of this, as shown in the following excerpts: “The Master's plan of sending them out to labor in a quiet and personal manner...” <a id="a55_155"></a>[UB 138:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_10), “...going about his Father's business in the most quiet and undramatic manner...” <a id="a55_284"></a>[UB 138:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_5), “Jesus had planned for a quiet missionary campaign...” <a id="a55_384"></a>[UB 138:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_1), “...months of quiet work...a great test to the apostles...” <a id="a55_489"></a>[UB 138:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p9_2), “Their efforts were chiefly of a more quiet and personal nature...” <a id="a55_602"></a>[UB 141:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p8_2), “...to do some quiet work..." <a id="a55_677"></a>[UB 144:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p0_3).

As we contemplate the unfolding of life on Urantia, let us also endeavor to seek out and embrace the calming, prosperous influence of Quiet. God bless!
