**Urantia Foundation presents Science Symposium III**
**“Science: The Interface of Evolution and Revelation”**
**Thursday, June 16, through Saturday, June 18**

If the pandemic taught us anything, it's that video and teleconferencing technology advanced massively over the last two years. For many of us it has become part of our daily lives, allowing us to transcend time and space as we gather together as a community of Urantia Book students.

Space is limited at 533, and not everyone's budget and schedule allow them to take a multi-day trip to Chicago. We want to initiate and encourage great conversations and interactions in the Urantia community, in a way that's accessible to more people than ever before.

For these reasons, the Education Committee has decided to plumb the depths of technology and offer the upcoming Science Symposium on an online platform. Many more of you will be able to attend and interact with our panel of researchers and aficionados as they delve into the dual perspectives of current science and _The Urantia Book_.

Presenters include Byron Belitsos, Phil Calabrese, Philippe Hatt, Gard Jameson, Conrad Lavallée, Jenny Martin, David Neufer, George Park, Marjorie Ray, and Ralph Zehr. So mark your calendar and plan to join our panelists as they delve into the myriad ways in which evolution continues to approach revelation.

A detailed announcement with links and the schedule of topics will be emailed in late spring. If you are interested in serving as a discussant, please contact joanne@urantia.org for additional information.

## Summer Study Session 2022

**_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship Education Committee**
Presents
**Machiventa Melchizedek: Preserving Truth and Lighting the Way for Future Revelations**

**Thursday, July 21 to Sunday, July 24**

Oak Brook Hills Resort and Conference Center
3500 Midwest Rd, Oak Brook, Illinois

Join us as we gather to learn about “one of the most unique of all characters ever to become connected with the history of Urantia.” <a id="a63_133"></a>[UB 93:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_11)

It was 4,000 years ago that Machiventa Melchizedek heroically “personalized” on earth at a perilous time when revealed truth was on the brink of extinction.

Come study, worship, and fraternize with us as we reflect on many of the features of the third epochal revelation and celebrate the 4,000th anniversary of Machiventa Melchizedek's bestowal on our planet!
