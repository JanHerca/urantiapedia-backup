She described her experience of trusting the truths of the Urantia Revelation as “the day I felt God in my soul, transforming me and giving a deep meaning and purpose in my life. Service was the key word, and there began my conscious journey.” Line has been involved in the Urantia movement since 2001 and has served many roles in the Canadian Urantia Book reading community. Today Line is vice president of the Urantia Canadian Association and is actively involved in coordinating and facilitating Urantia Book workshops, conferences, and study groups.
