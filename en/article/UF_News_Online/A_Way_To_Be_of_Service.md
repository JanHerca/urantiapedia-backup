Here is a chance to express your gratitude and love for _The Urantia Book_. When individuals browse the Internet for products or services, nothing gets attention or boosts confidence more than lots of five-star ratings on the items being viewed. The higher the ratings, the more trust an individual will have.

Today _The Urantia Book_ has 737 reviews on Amazon. The Foundation's goal is to hit 1000 reviews by December 31, 2018.

If you have not written a review, please take twenty minutes and express how this revelation has transformed your life. Even if Amazon requires you to buy a book in order to write a review, today's price is only $15.79. This is a small price to pay for a book, and it's an opportunity to be of service and to give back to the revelation!
