## What _The Urantia Book_ Means to Me

In the first 55 years of my eternal life, I have experienced many “game changing,” life-impacting events: first physical life awareness, first moral decision, first day of school, first Little League home run, turning 13 , finally winning a fight with my big brother, Daryl, being Toledo Mud Hen's batboy, the graduation of loved ones, first love, first kiss, loss of innocence, Secretariat turning for home, being captain of my high school baseball team, giving my life to God, true appreciation of my family, moving away from home, first day on a real job, living on the beach, making new friends, family health realities, moving back home, my mother's on-going smile, graduation of friends, marriage (finally), and my mother and brother's guiding light-just to name a few. And although I did not realize it at the time, 35 years ago, the most life-changing event of all was the day I found _The Urantia Book_, or perhaps it found me-l'm not sure which.

_The Urantia Book_ has taught me everything I really need to know. It has revealed to me the deepest truths and mysteries of life and introduced me to so many wonderful fellow Urantia Book readers. It has made ultimate sense of the past, present, and eternal destiny of mankind. It is my spiritual-life guidebook and source for all things eternally significant. It has taught me the beautiful attributes of a great life and the values of being good, reasonable, wise, faithful, merciful, tolerant, truthful, trustful, trusting, appreciative, courageous, hopeful, patient, sympathetic, loyal, unselfish, humble, sincere, adventurous, curious, fearless, kind, fair, just, serving of others, loving of work, humorous, cheerful, zealous, enthusiastic, positive, calm, peaceful, righteous, ego-free, low in pride, prayerful, and worshipful-just to name a few.

What a blessing and privilege it has been to live most of this first life knowing just a few of the amazing absolute truths that Michael knew when he lived his life here on earth as Jesus. How great it has been that _The Urantia Book_ has made me aware of the fragment of God that lives within me and that I can have a personal relationship with God through this divine gift.. that God dwells within me and leads me Godward, every step of the way, and by choosing to cooperate with God and do his will, life continues after physical death.

I am forever grateful that _The Urantia Book_ has taught me how to prepare for the eternity of life; to cherish every day of life; to love the truth; to desire to do good to others; that life is an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery; and to simply love one another.

I love _The Urantia Book_!

Stay gold my brothers and sisters. I so look forward to growing with you throughout eternity and becoming perfected spirits in Paradise with you.

Life is beautiful!

## So Many Questions Answered

When I think of how my mind has expanded cosmically because of the teachings within _The Urantia Book_, I feel total gratitude and appreciation. I now have tangible explanations for who is God the Father? What is the Trinity? How is Jesus the begotten Son of God? How can God be everywhere and also within me? How do I fit into the plan of perfection? I now have a concept of what omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient means.

I've learned how important my life and freewill decisions are and how they affect the big picture, the Supreme Being. It has expanded my thoughts and mind on the other beings our Universal Father has created in different dimensions of reality. For me to realize that we are a vast family of created beings all working to perfect our Father's plan of perfection is the best “gig” going! If our Universal Father was running for the office of First Source and Center, I would vote for him again. He is the Absolute Best!

This book has revealed so much truth to me. It has answered so many questions I have had about who I am, what is life about, and what happens after this life. I am so excited about the eternal journey of everlasting life. It is everlasting because you can never learn all there is to know about our infinite Father, ever!

Thank you Midway Creatures for your persistence in petitioning for this revelation and to all the other unseen authors for these papers of revealed truth to our planet, Urantia.

I am blessed and grateful! Janet Falbo, Boca Raton, Florida, USA
