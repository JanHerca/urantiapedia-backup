> Fantastic. The best newsletter/serial that has ever been produced by the Foundation to date. You are now a truly “user friendly” organization! Bravo to all who worked on this project. The graphics are lovely in addition to wonderful reporting. The work and spirit of brotherhood among the trustees is truly inspiring. We are so blessed to have Jay and Tamara and team efforts at the office.

> Thank you for the online news letter. My wife and I have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for about 9 months and have just about finished the Life and Teachings of Jesus and is just mesmerizing. I have searched all my life (off and on) for what I feel is the truth about God and Jesus. Those who preach “It's our way or none at all to get into the Kingdom of God” need to read and follow _The Urantia Book_. I thank those who introduced me to its teachings.
> 
> I thank you for all that you do to make the book available to the world. Oh what a wonder- ful world it would be if every soul would read it and follow its teachings. Thank You.

Dave Reynolds (USA)

> WOW! Great design, layout, information and finally a feeling that you belong to a group who love and admire _The Urantia Book_. Thanks to whomever for creating this wonderful, informative, connective masterpiece. PLEASE, share my appreciation. Thanks so much!

Darlene Ousley (USA)

> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! BY the way -- Georges looks fantastic with a beard!
