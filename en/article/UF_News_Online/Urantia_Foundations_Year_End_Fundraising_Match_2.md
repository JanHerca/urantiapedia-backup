Donors have pledged to match your donations, dollarfor-dollar, up to $190,000 until December 31, 2015. Donate now and help Urantia Foundation seed _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings globally!

Right now, at this very moment, the vast majority of people throughout the world are living in the best material conditions in our million-year human existence. That sounds counter intuitive based on the nightly news, but the quality of life statistics over the last sixty years are overwhelmingly positive. Worldwide trends reveal an unprecedented improvement in education, technology, calories consumed, health care, life expectancy, disease eradication, literacy, communications, travel, leisure time, world trade, and national democratization. Growth in the gross domestic product of the world's largest economies has resulted in the biggest middle class in world history. Simultaneously death from starvation, childhood diseases, world wars, and devastating pandemics are at an all-time low. Humanity is beginning to disdain oppression, social irresponsibility, greed, war, and intolerance. “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” <a id="a42_1062"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)

Improvement in world conditions has set the stage for the most important advancement and greatest need of all, the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. The revelators understood that sustainable improvements in material conditions required an upgrade in our values and meanings to keep our world safe. They foresaw that lasting progress depended upon a new spiritual and cosmological vision commensurate with man's growing intellectual and cultural development. They knew materialism couldn't buy love and that only God can fill that empty space in our hearts. In response, they gave us a perfectly timed new book to spiritually guide and stabilize us over the next 1000 years.

We are writing to you during this holiday season asking for your financial help in seeding _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings globally. If Urantia Foundation raises $190,000 before December 31,2015 , a group of donors will match your contributions dollar for dollar. For every dollar you give, these donors will give another dollar. Your donations directly pay for translations, translation revisions, book printing and distribution, website activities, outreach, and education.

Our world is being swept along in the forward march of progressive evolution within the Supreme. We are truly blessed to be alive today and privileged to give to this epochal revelation. As we progress in our universe careers, we will fondly remember our short time on earth and be thankful that we gave generously to the most important catalyst for moral quickening and spiritual enlightenment since Jesus walked on earth.

Thank you for your continued prayers and support. We send our best wishes for a joyous holiday!
