## A Women's Retreat—Dancing With God

_By Line St-Pierre, Québec, Canada_

_The Urantia Book_ tells us that, as we are lead by the Spirit of God, we are the daughters and sons of God.

Have you ever had an inspiration of value and acted upon it, which brought you spiritual joy?

At our next retreat, “Dancing with God,” four daughters of God have put together a program whereby the participants will explore questions, such as:

How do we understand and experience the fact that “woman has always been the moral standard-bearer and the spiritual leader of mankind”? What is woman's next evolutionary step in upholding and expanding this responsibility?

How have we come to know and experience God's gifts and wisdom expressed through women?

Of the many gifts—mind, body, spirit, consciousness, and personality, for example—given to us to aid us on our ascension career, how do we become aware of the sacredness of these gifts?

If you would like to join us on September 10 to 13 at 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago, contact Joanne Strobel at joanne@urantia.org.

## Urantia Association International Summer Conference-An Event Not To Be Missed

_By Gaétan Charland, Québec, Canada_

Something important is happening this summer in Quebec, Canada. From July 30 to August 2, a conference sponsored by Urantia Association International is taking place and needs your participation. These international conferences are events that should not be missed; they provide unparalleled opportunities of social interaction and inner growth while promoting a genuine fraternity with others from many cultures.

The conference will focus on one of the most important teachings of _The Urantia Book_: the education of the family and society. Many of us are looking for ways to disseminate and share advanced techniques with our children, family, and friends. This conference will feature plenaries and workshops that will explore these relevant topics. The program has been designed so that workshops are linked in synergy to the corresponding plenaries.

We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible at this event. Many readers are coming from around the world, and our financial aid committee is working hard to collect funds and manage requests from readers who need financial assistance to attend this conference. If you feel generous, please contribute to our scholarship fund by visiting https://urantiaassociation.org/getinvolved/support-uai/.
