## The Parliament of the World's Religions

In August of 2023, the Parliament of the World's Religions will return to Chicago and the birthplace of the modern interfaith movement. The theme is “A Call to Conscience: Defending Freedom & Human Rights.”

Four Urantia organizations—Truthbook, Urantia Association International, the Urantia Book Fellowship, and Urantia Foundation — are once again sharing the cost of a double booth.

More information will be available for members of the readership who wish to attend and volunteer time in the booth. If you want to go even further to ensure that the fifth epochal revelation is well represented at this event, consider making a presentation! Proposals are due by November 4, 2022.
