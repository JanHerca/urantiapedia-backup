_By the trustees and staff of Urantia Foundation_

As ascending pilgrims of time, we have all been challenged to “feast upon uncertainty..., to invigorate in the presence of difficulties..., and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable.” <a id="a44_233"></a>[UB 26:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_3) And we do this not alone, but together as siblings.

The past year certainly brought challenges. But we have the assurances of a divine revelation, a glimpse into the very mind of God, where his plan embraces each one of us. “And this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving!” <a id="a46_356"></a>[UB 32:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7) articles in this issue, we hope you will draw inspiration from the heartfelt love, joyful service, and exciting programs that readers across the world are eager to share with you.

And as we celebrate the season of peace, goodwill toward men, faith, hope, and brotherhood, please remember to support the important work of Urantia Foundation in seeding _The Urantia Book_ (now available in 24 languages!) across the globe.

If you have already given, we thank you. If not, please help us continue to spread the revelation by giving to the **2020 Winter Match**. Several donors have agreed to match up to $225,000 if we can raise that amount by the end of the year. This generous offer expires **on December 31** so please help us reach this goal.

**Every dollar counts... twice!**

[Click here to donate](https://www.urantia.org/donate/newDonate).

May you and your loved ones be blessed with abundant joy, peace, and good health.
