## Update to the Apple Urantia Book App

After making _The Urantia Book_ and many of its translations available as a free app to all users of iPhones and iPads for nearly a decade, the creator of the app has released the biggest update in its history — a top-of-the-line search engine within the app. The new version of the app is [available for download in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-urantia-book/id384682683?mt=11).

The search engine becomes fully available after the purchase of an inexpensive subscription (starting at $5.94 per year to unlock full search capabilities). All proceeds go toward covering the expenses and maintenance of this project as well as its associated website, [bigbluebook.org](http://bigbluebook.org/). The app and website are both carefully designed to be “the book and nothing but the book.” There are no distractions, no ads, and both are easy to use and easy to share.

## The Urantia Book Fellowship's Summer Study Session 2018 

_The Urantia Book_ Fellowship's Summer Study Session 2018 will be held at Techny Towers in Northbrook, Illinois, again this year. It is an opportunity to join your Urantia Book family in study, worship, and fellowship. As always, inspired speakers will share their thoughts, and creative students will provide engaging workshops.

In addition, there will be daily contemplative worship time. “Worship — contemplation of the spiritual—must alternate with service, contact with material reality.” <a id="a43_164"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3) We will take time to “contemplate the spiritual” so that we may better worship and serve along with our celestial family.

The Summer Study Session will be held from July 19 to 22, preceded by a two-day spiritual retreat, “A Circle of Trust: Faith, Trust, and Assurance" beginning on Tuesday evening, July 17.

There is still time to register online at [www.regonline.com/Urantia_Fellowship_SSS18](http://www.regonline.com/Urantia_Fellowship_SSS18).
