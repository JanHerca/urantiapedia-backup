Urantia Foundation needs your help today! 

_Several generous donors will contribute $220,000 if we can raise the same amount by December 31_. Your matching gift will make it possible to cover the remaining 2018 operating expenses and to continue in 2019 the work of seeding _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings globally. 

When you see the suffering in the world, the more you understand how vital it is to share _The Urantia Book_'s message that we are all children of the same loving Heavenly Father. We each experience God's love as we love our fellows. Jesus made it Clear that we are to love one another as he loves us, no matter a person's race, religion, gender, economic status, or nationality. Imagine how much joy people would feel if they only followed Jesus' instruction.

We are so grateful for your friendship and generosity in helping to further the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_. Your support enables the spiritually searching to discover and experience the profound light of the living truth that we have all come to embrace. Nothing is more potent than these teachings to open the eyes of the spiritually blind while helping the world's people transition from our current secular age into a more cooperative era of spirituality. We are told that, “In this gigantic struggle between the secular and the spiritual, the religion of Jesus will eventually triumph.” <a id="a48_600"></a>[UB 195:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p4_5) Until then, however, there remains much work to be done. 

Putting the gospel of love into action means serving one another. “With God the Father, sonship is the great relationship. With God the Supreme, achievement is the prerequisite to status—one must do something as well as be something.” <a id="a50_235"></a>[UB 115:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p0_1) Beca use we are partners in this grand endeavor, our acts of selfless service for the Urantia Revelation are one way of making our love for God and our commitment to his universe plan a reality in the world today.

Having experienced the benefit of these teachings, will you please consider working with us to provide peoples of the world with this same truth? If so, your donations to Urantia Foundation make it possible to translate _The Urantia Book_ into many languages, print and globally distribute them, promote study groups, foster outreach endeavors, manage urantia.org, operate the Urantia Book Internet School, maintain the historic headquarters in Chicago, and conduct educational seminars. 

Friends, now is the time to act and help shine the beautiful light of these teachings to all the world! Please join with us in this endeavor and make your matching gift today.

With you in service, 

The Trustees: Gard Jameson, Marilynn Kulieke, Georges Michelson-Dupont, Mo Siegel, Judy Van Cleave
