## Women's Retreat-the Daughters of God

**October 24-26**

Facilitated by Line St-Pierre, Katharina Becker, Carolyn Prentice and Doreen Heyne.

It is written that men and women are different in nature, reaction, viewpoint, and thinking. How do women who are inspired by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ receive God's wisdom and use the gifts that he entrusted us with?

In a circle of trust amongst participants, we will be reflecting on what makes us stand in our own feminine sphere and how we value its importance.

- **Mission:** To enhance the status of being a woman dedicated to spiritual growth, intellectual advancement, and moral progress.

- **Vision:** To touch women's hearts by exploring the dignity of being daughters of God, by honoring their value and importance, and by co-operating with the divine spirit within to bring forth the bountiful fruits of the spirit.

## The Urantia Book Android App

_The Urantia Book_ Android App is now available in all 16 languages in Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Urantia\Foundation&hl=en.

The price - $0.99

If you use an Android Phone or Tablet and you already own a physical copy of _The Urantia Book_, as well as the audio version, the eBook version, a PDF version, and if you are old enough-and hip enough-to have owned the five floppy-disk set (runs in the Windows &reg; environment on IBMcompatible computers), then you surely need the Android App version.

If that is not reason enough, be assured that income from the sales of the Android App (and other formats of _The Urantia Book_) go towards developing new formats and mediums for the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_.

If you have any questions, please contact Tamara at tamara@urantia.org.
