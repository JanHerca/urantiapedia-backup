**Announcement**

**October 31-November 2, 2014**

Led by Marta Elders, associate trustee, Darien, Connecticut, United States

Do you want to expand your consciousness and deepen your spiritual perception of the soul? Then you might consider participating in a workshop at Urantia Foundation-a workshop on the soul that will focus on answering the following questions: What is the soul? How does it develop? What is its purpose? Its value? Its meaning? Its origin? Its nature? Its destiny? Its significance in your life? Its relation to the Supreme Being? To mind? To cosmic citizenship? And what is newly revealed about the soul in _The Urantia Book_?

The workshop will consist of a small group of students of _The Urantia Book_ who will meet on Friday, October 31 through Sunday, November 2. All participants will be asked 1) to prepare a 3-5 page paper to be distributed to the other participants prior to the weekend and 2) to prepare a short meditative type of experiential exercise to be offered during the weekend.

Marta Elders will be leading this workshop. If you would like to learn more or would like to participate, please contact Joanne Strobel at joanne@urantia.org.

We invite you to attend this workshop and hope to grow and learn with you.

> Facilitators are needed who are well versed in the teachings.
