<br>
<b>The Marriage and Family Adventure! An Online Symposium</b><br>
<br>
<b>Friday and Saturday, June 14 - 15, 2024</b><br>
</p>

Join us as we examine the rich tapestry of marriage and family as viewed in _The Urantia Book_, academia, and personal experience. This enlightening and comprehensive series of presentations will explore the multifaceted aspects of relationships, unions, and familial dynamics.

Our goal is to offer inspiration and guidance for individuals and families seeking to navigate the complexities of human relationships. They are the most spiritual of adventures.

Each session will be 30 minutes long, followed by a 30-minute discussion period. For added flavor emcees Bill and Share Beasley will sprinkle bits of experiential wisdom and humor throughout the event.

If you are interested in presenting a session during this important symposium, please send your ideas and qualifications to [joanne@urantia.org](mailto:joanne@urantia.org). Couples and co-presenters are encouraged!
