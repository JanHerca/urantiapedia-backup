_By the trustees and staff of Urantia Foundation_

When we purchase an appliance, automobile, or cell phone with a warranty, we feel reassured. Home insurance policies provide comfort in knowing that damages will be paid for. Health insurance gives us peace of mind. Unfortunately, even the best warranties come with fine print defining an escape clause for the insurer. They also lapse and expire.

How about receiving eternal promises with unbreakable assurances? Does that sound too good to be true? It's not! _The Urantia Book_ is full of such promises. These commitments come from the heart of the First Source and Center and are implemented by our own Creator Son and Creative Mother Spirit.
Machiventa Melchizedek assured us of “the great Urantian agreement between divinity and humanity whereby God agrees to do everything; man only agrees to believe God's promises and follow his instructions.” <a id="a45_206"></a>[UB 93:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_4)

In today's uncertain world, readers of _The Urantia Book_ are assured of the Father's presence, loving-kindness, compassion, and everlasting mercy. We are comforted and guided by Jesus through his Spirit of Truth. We are thrilled at the promise that “the goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you!” <a id="a47_337"></a>[UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8)

Five generous donors have agreed to contribute $215,000 which will be matched dollar for dollar if we raise the same amount by Saturday, December 31. Your gift to Urantia Foundation will help transform lives, and eventually the world, because it is our mission—our promise to you—to seed _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings globally.
