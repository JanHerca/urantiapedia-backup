_Editor's Note: The First Society of _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, The Greater Lake Michigan Association of Urantia Association International, and Urantia Foundation hosted their annual holiday party on Saturday evening, December 7. The party began with a short program directed by Carolynn Kendall. She asked attendees to read selected quotes about God the Father, the Father's love, God's goodness, God's justice and mercy, God's watchcare, the light of the Father's presence, the Supreme Being, and human love and devotion._

Joanne Strobel prepared and served a delicious meal, young children ran around and played, and friendships were strengthened. It was an evening of fun and fellowship enjoyed by all. Perhaps you will make plans to attend next year!
