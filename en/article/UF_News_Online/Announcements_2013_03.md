## Spiritual Truths Of Cosmic Power: Seek, Study, Grow, Share

A program titled “Spiritual Truths of Cosmic Power: Seek, Study, Grow, Share” will be held at Urantia Foundation, beginning on Thursday evening, May 30, and ending at noon on Sunday, June 2 , 2013. We will study, commune, hear presentations from participants, address difficulties, and support one another. It is designed for the young, the old, and the in-between. There is an optional project that uses revealed and tested methods of experiential education. If you are interested, contact organizer Jeff Wattles: jwattles@kent.edu, and choose the level of participation that fits your spirit of adventure.
