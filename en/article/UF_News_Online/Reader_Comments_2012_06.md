## What _The Urantia Book_ Means to me

_By Graciela Cristina Benedetti, Bahía Blanca, Argentina_

From the very first moment that I found _The Urantia Book_, I felt a wave of love guiding my life, inundating cold corners of myself with its warm, tender touch, and illuminating every little dark place inside me with its awesome teachings. This revelation mobilized me and gave new values to every single part of me that had been still and drowsy until that time.

My name is Graciela Cristina Benedetti. My husband and I have three boys and live in Bahía Blanca, a port city south of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In October 1999, I attended a conference and was amazed by what I heard from one of the speakers, whom I asked to send me his speech, which he did. He made it clear that his speech was inspired by _The Urantia Book_, which could be found at www.urantia.org. One day my curiosity led me to click on that link, and from that day forward, I initiated my own personal cosmic adventure by reading _The Urantia Book_.

I have taken courses through the Urantia Book Internet School and have joined a study group.

The more I read, the more I realize that this book teaches about the love of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and about how that love, progressively and surely, embraces and carries us to Paradise.

## The Book's Perfection

_By John Strobel, Chicago, Illinois, USA_

Although my wife, Joanne, read _The Urantia Book_ for many years, I did not start reading it until after the visit of a good friend who had a barrage of questions to ask Joanne about the book. It was Joanne's thoughtful answers to those questions that intrigued me and finally sparked my interest to read it. First, I read Part IV, the Life and Teachings of Jesus. Then I read the papers about Adam and Eve. I still have not read all the papers.

What struck me immediately was the book's perfection; I had no doubt as to its authenticity. While I had found that much of the Bible was interpreted (many scholars have spent their entire life studying and interpreting just a few books of the Bible), _The Urantia Book_ was in plain English.

The more I read it, the greater is my appreciation and desire to continue reading it. I have found that the study group I attend has been a wonderful help in unlocking the treasures of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

What means most to me is reading _The Urantia Book_ with Joanne and sharing this experience with her. I'm sure she must have prayed many times that I would become interested in the book and that I would finally come around.
