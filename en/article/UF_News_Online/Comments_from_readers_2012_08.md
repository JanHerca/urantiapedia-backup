**Knowing that God is my Father**

_By Andrew Story, Dayton, Ohio, USA_

The value, meaning, and beauty that I find in _The Urantia Book_ is directly the result of my experience of knowing God and knowing that God is my Father.

The time in my life when I found _The Urantia Book_ was a time of much personal change. I had grown up in a Christian family, and my father was a pastor of a Christian church. I remember my first confirmation and having many questions about my relationship to God and the meaning of Jesus' life as it related to our personal spiritual growth and our ability to attain eternal life.

I asked my father why it was necessary for someone to accept Jesus as their savior to have eternal life. I could not understand how someone would not go to heaven if they had never even heard of him. The answer that I was given only explained that this was God's plan, and that, in order for man's relationship with God to be restored, Jesus had to die on the cross. This answer led me to distance myself from a spiritual life. I believed that a person living a good life should be enough to have a relationship with God.

Later I became interested in reading about other religions and new-age books. When I read Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You, I had a rejuvenation of my spiritual search. Tolstoy wrote about looking specifically at Jesus' teachings and at the way he lived his life as being the best approach to understanding his message.

He felt that Jesus' message was that God is within each of us, a part of each one of us, and that when we experience this truth, we shall begin to see the truth of the Golden Rule.

A few months later I told a friend that I truly wanted to know God. I let go of my fears related to my earlier religious experiences, and I opened myself up and allowed God in. My friend then introduced me to _The Urantia Book_. I looked through it on my own and read on the back about study groups. I wanted to meet other readers and share with them what I was experiencing. I asked my friend if he knew of a study group in our area, and he suggested that we start one.

I remember reading Paper 1 , “The Universal Father,” and resonating so clearly with the words describing God's purpose, his goodness, and his plan for each person to achieve perfection.

The following paragraph in Paper 1 held profound meaning for me:

> On those worlds where a Paradise Son has lived a bestowal life, God is generally known by some name indicative of personal relationship, tender affection, and fatherly devotion. On your constellation headquarters God is referred to as the Universal Father, and on different planets in your local system of inhabited worlds he is variously known as the Father of Fathers, the Paradise Father, the Havona Father, and the Spirit Father. Those who know God through the revelations of the bestowals of the Paradise Sons, eventually yield to the sentimental appeal of the touching relationship of the creature-Creator association and refer to God as “our Father.” _The Urantia Book_, <a id="a57_680"></a>[UB 1:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p1_5)

There is much meaning in _The Urantia Book_, but the truth of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man is the truth most close to my experience of knowing God.

**What _The Urantia Book_ Means to me**

_By Angela Thurston, Brooklyn, New York, USA_

These few words just begin to describe:

**Insight** into the purpose of my existence, which begins and ends with love.

**Inspiration** to set ever higher spiritual goals and to take failures as the most valuable cosmic lessons.

**Appreciation** for the beautiful, challenging, lovingly-designed and clumsily-evolving world around me and the remarkable sojourners who call it home.

**Encouragement** to seek loving relationships with my brothers and sisters, through whom I find God.

**Freedom** from any dogma that would ask me to judge these brothers and sisters or myself.

**Responsibility** to act, to serve, to lead by example—to put the words of revelation into the deeds of a new era of spiritual growth.

**Empowerment** to take risks in a loving universe, knowing I am cradled by a cosmos in which I can only fall deeper into discovery.

**Permission** to enjoy existing, to participate in the humor, the creativity, the delight, the confusion, and the moments of extraordinary grace.

**Opportunity** to bridge gaps in dialogue among religion, science, and philosophy across existing cultures and creeds.

**Faith** that God has put his faith in me to journey ever closer to him.

**Comfort** that I have a legion of cosmic cheerleaders every step of the way.

**Anticipation** of a bright, eternal future in which we all, in our magnificent uniqueness, say together: It is our will that your will be done.
