## Latin American Readers Asked for Support and You Responded!

In August of this year, we asked for readers to support the Latin American reader community by sponsoring booths at book fairs. The response was heartwarming and generous! We are happy to announce that the goal of $12,000 was met by September 30 .

The trustees of Urantia Foundation thank you for helping to support local Latin American communities of Urantia Book readers as they spread the Urantia Revelation.

“Go into all the world proclaiming this gospel to all nations, to every man, woman, and child.” Jesus, _The Urantia Book_, <a id="a47_123"></a>[UB 165:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p6_3)

## The Untold Story of Jesus — The newest title from Urantia Press

With 106 paintings from 35 renowned artists, including 42 originally commissioned works, The Untold Story of Jesus is an exquisitely rendered biography excerpted from _The Urantia Book_.

A perfect gift for the holidays!
