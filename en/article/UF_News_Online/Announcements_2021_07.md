“All human progress is effected by a technique of conjoint revelational evolution.” <a id="a69_84"></a>[UB 196:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_15)

The explosion of information and innovation in fields such as anthropology, archeology, chemistry, cosmology, paleontology, physics, planetology, and psychology brings new perspectives to public consciousness. This symposium will delve into the dual perspectives of revelation and current science relating to evolution and its various aspects of race, culture, genetics, and gender. The purpose is to educate and prepare the readership to deftly handle questions concerning sensitive topics as revealed in _The Urantia Book_.

If you are interested in presenting, please contact joanne@urantia.org for details.

## The Untold Story of Jesus Second Printing

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia">

Urantia Press is happy to announce that the second printing of The Untold Story of Jesus is now available. After a multi-year effort, we thought the first printing was everything it could be. But as we know, “The creature may crave infallibility, but only the Creators possess it.” <a id="a81_282"></a>[UB 159:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_8)

So, for the second printing everything was subject to review. The improvements are too numerous to list, but they run cover to cover. There is only one thing that can never be improved, and that is the saving gospel of Jesus. The last quote in the book says it all:

“The religion of Jesus is the most powerful unifying influence the world has ever known.” <a id="a85_90"></a>[UB 194:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_17)

What a great way of introducing the revealed life and teachings of Jesus to your friends and family.

It includes new maps of the world Jesus traveled and lived in, a timeline, an index, and much more - all at an affordable price. Purchase a copy now on Amazon for only $21.99.
