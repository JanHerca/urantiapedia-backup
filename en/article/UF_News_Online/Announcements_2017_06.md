## “Dancing With God: Emerging In Sacredness”

**A Daughters Of God Retreat**

Announcing the latest in our continuing series of women's retreats at Urantia Foundation, the Daughters of God facilitator team (Katharina Becker, Doreen Heyne, Carolyn Prentice, and Line St-Pierre) invites you to an intimate, experiential, and fun weekend.

In our next retreat, “Dancing with God: Emerging in Sacredness,” four Daughters of God have designed a program where we will cocreate a milieu of trust within a spiritual circle, so that we can explore together such questions as:

- What does it mean to you that “Jesus never failed to exalt the sacredness of the individual”? <a id="a45_96"></a>[UB 170:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_10)

- “Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind.” How do you relate to this? <a id="a47_84"></a>[UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1)
- How do you become aware of the sacred in the drudgery of everyday life?

The Daughters of God Mission: To enhance the status of being a woman dedicated to spiritual growth, intellectual advancement, and moral progress.

The Daughters of God Vision: To touch women's hearts by exploring the dignity of being Daughters of God by honoring their value and importance, and by cooperating with the divine spirit to bring forth the beautiful harvest of the fruits of the spirit.

The cost for the three days is $240.00 and includes all meals and shared overnight accommodations on a first-come basis. The retreat begins with dinner on Thursday evening and ends after lunch on Sunday.

If you would like to be a part of this event at Urantia Foundation headquarters, 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago, contact Joanne Strobel at joanne@urantia.org.
