For many years I searched high and low for the truth. My mother gave me _The Urantia Book_, and one day I opened it to a random page that discussed a particular question I had been wrestling with. I was very excited because the answer made logical sense. Although I remained skeptical about its origin, I decided to read it as a fiction book to see if I could gain a few pearls of wisdom. Soon I could not put it down, and I ravenously devoured every word. I kept looking for the part that did not make sense, but I never found it!

_The Urantia Book_ means everything to me! It has changed my life. I had a very dreary outlook on life and not much hope for the future. Now life has meaning. Knowing that there is a God who lives this life with me, in fact in me, is comfort beyond expression! Knowing the truth about what Jesus went through gives me an inner strength that could not come from any worldly source. I owe everything to this revelation, and my greatest desire is to share it with others. Truth is truth, and when you hear it, it rings so deep within your being that its source is entirely irrelevant. Thank you Foundation. I am at your service.

Mahalo and Aloha

In this world _The Urantia Book_ reveals that we are a human family and sons of God. By doing God's will we can hope for future worlds through loving service. The liberating truth of _The Urantia Book_ is a life-enhancing and an all encompassing inspiration that points the direction to the Universal Father.

The book “Urantia” has answers to questions that I thought would never be answered. This book is wonderful and so full of good news. The answers to my questions, I know in my heart, are right. What wonderful times lie before us in the after life.
