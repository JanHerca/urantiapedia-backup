Location: Techny Towers, Northbook, Illinois, July 9-12

Join with fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_ this summer as we explore “Our Relationship with God the Father.” With a focus on Papers 1-5, the Education Committee is initiating a journey through the major themes in _The Urantia Book_.

The conference committee is planning a variety of experiences, including workshops for new readers, in-depth study, experiential workshops, and advanced studies. In addition to the study program, there will be opportunities to participate in worshipful meditation and to enjoy renewing old friendships and making new ones.

Although readers go to the Fellowship's Summer Study Session for a variety of reasons, a major incentive for attending is the high quality of the workshops. The conference team is requesting workshop proposals appropriate for new readers as well as indepth study for “veterans.” There will be a track for workshops which are primarily experiential, but all workshop leaders should plan to engage participants actively.

If you have an idea for a workshop on this summer's theme, please request a Workshop Proposal Form from David Kulieke at david.kulieke@gmail.com.

A preconference retreat, “Creating Circles of Trust,” will be held from July 7 to July 9.

_By Gaétan Charland, Québec, Canada_

Something important is happening this summer in Québec, Canada. From July 30 to August 2, a conference sponsored by Urantia Association International is taking place and needs your participation. These international conferences are events that should not be missed; they provide unparalleled opportunities of social interaction and inner growth while promoting a genuine fraternity with others from many cultures.

The conference will focus on one of the most important teachings of _The Urantia Book_: the education of the family and society. Many of us are looking for ways to disseminate and share advanced techniques with our children, family, and friends. This conference will feature plenaries and workshops that will explore these relevant topics. The program has been designed so that workshops are linked in synergy to the corresponding plenaries.

We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible at this event. Many readers are coming from around the world, and our financial aid committee is working hard to collect funds and manage requests from readers who need financial assistance to attend this conference. If you feel generous, please contribute to our scholarship fund by visiting urantiaassociation.org/getinvolved/support-uai.

Please register for the event as soon as possible. By doing so, you will benefit from discounted pricing and from the exchange to Canadian money.

You may register at the following website: www.regonline.ca/builder/sit e/Default.aspx?EventID=164 3032.
