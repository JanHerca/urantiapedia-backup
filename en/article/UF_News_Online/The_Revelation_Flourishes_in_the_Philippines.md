Gardeners often repeat the “Sleep, Creep, Leap” adage that is used to simplify the typical phases a perennial plant will go through to reach its full mature size. At some point, when the “leap” becomes apparent, the patient gardener smiles and recognizes that the results were worth the wait.

Eugene and Belen Asidao of the Chicago area must surely be smiling as they reflect upon the fruits of their labors in the Philippines. Since 2013, they have been propagating the seeds of the fifth epochal revelation in their home country. Urantia Foundation has donated hundreds of
Urantia Books that have been disseminated to libraries, universities, and interested individuals. New readers and study groups have been encouraged and nurtured. Five are already registered in the online Study Group Directory. Marikina City, Bacolod, Iloilo City, Pasig City, and Quezon City study group leaders are eagerly waiting to welcome new readers.

Groups dedicated to youth and women have formed, and Jesus' Birthday is widely celebrated. Filipino readers even organized a conference in 2019!

Reader organizations such as Urantia Association International and the Urantia Book Fellowship have been cultivating the soil, and after several years of preparation, Urantia Foundation announced a Filipino translation in 2020. The team is close to completing Paper 31 , and the translation of Part I will be finished!

Eugene and Belen recently set off on their fourth tour back home, continuing the work they began almost a decade ago. We are delighted to share some pictures.

Please remember Eugene and Belen, the many local readers, and the translation team in your prayers as they work to bring _The Urantia Book_ to the Filipinospeaking people.
