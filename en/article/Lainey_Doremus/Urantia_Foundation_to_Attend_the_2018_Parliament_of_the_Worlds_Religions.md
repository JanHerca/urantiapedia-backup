_By Lainey Doremus, Urantia Foundation, Illinois, United States_

Urantia Foundation is excited to attend the 2018 Parliament of the World's Religions from November 1 to 7, in Toronto, Canada. The theme for this year is: “The Promise of Inclusion, the Power of Love: Pursuing Global Understanding, Reconciliation, and Change.”

In partnership with Truthbook.com, Urantia Association International, and the Urantia Book Fellowship, we are hosting a booth and providing inviting outreach materials that will help seed truths of the book's teachings to interested attendees. There will certainly be plenty of volunteers to spend time in the booth—nearly 100 Urantia Book readers have signed up to attend.

Considered to be the oldest, most diverse, and inclusive global interfaith event, this year's theme draws from movements of goodwill and cross-cultural respect that are embodied in the spirit of the interfaith movement. The Parliament of the World's Religions mission is “to cultivate harmony among the world's religious and spiritual communities and foster their engagement with the world and its guiding institutions in order to achieve a just, peaceful, and sustainable world.” What a perfect way to seek to understand and be understood by other dedicated religionists who are committed to making our world a better place.

Readers of _The Urantia Book_ will present the following workshops:

Saturday, November 3, from 3:15 to 4:15 p.m.

**Love is the Greatest Thing in the World**

Pato Banton Concert
Room Festival Stage

Saturday, November 3, from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.

**A Way of Life in the Family of God: The Global Vision of _The Urantia Book_**

The preparations to attend the Parliament are the result of a wonderful team effort by members from all organizations participating. Special thanks go to Cristina Seaborn, Joanne Strobel, and Paula Thompson for their exceptional work in making this happen, as well as to Gary Tonge for designing the booth. Everyone has been actively involved to ensure that we give the Urantia Revelation the best first impression possible to Parliament participants. This has been a stellar example of sharing common goals and group cooperation.
