_By Yeesook Yoon, Inchon, South Korea_

Ever since childhood, I have been interested in God, humanity, the universe, and truth, so I found and read many books on these subjects. As an adult, I deliberately searched for and met intellectuals, monks, pastors, and priests who could answer my questions. But my thirst for knowledge was never quenched.

When I was 33 years old, I accidentally typed the words “spirit adjuster” into the internet search bar and unexpectedly the words “thought adjuster” came up instead. What I read made my heart leap!

It was through the medium of the internet, which was new to the world in the spring of 2000, that I first encountered _The Urantia Book_. At the time, I was working two jobs, as president of YESLINK—a company I founded—and as the managing director of a construction company.

I made a request to the president of the construction company, saying, “I have come across a book that is very important to my life, but it is more than 2000 pages and I need two months of time to read it. So please give me a vacation.” He looked at me and shook his head. In his eyes I had become strange after finding a strange book! Nevertheless, he graciously agreed.

After finishing the book, I began meeting with a Urantia study group. Seven to ten of us would meet every Saturday to study. The group included David Kim, who was in charge of the Korean translation of _The Urantia Book_, Won Myung Lee, Si-Young Jang, Pan Soo Park, Dr. Lee, and Dr. Hong, who now resides on the mansion worlds. At that time, we would raise our voices and argue over our different interpretations of the content and topics. But looking back, I now remember it as a time of great innocence and passion. Since that time, our members have valued each other like a family.

Korea hosted the World Cup in 2002. Mr. Piobak of Seattle, Washington, visited at the invitation of the Korean World Cup organizers, and I was asked to pick him up at the airport. He elected to stay at my house, preferring my son’s bedroom over the best hotel suites because he craved home-style baekban and miso jjigae like his mother used to cook. Before he returned to Seattle, I gave Mr. Piobak a gift of _The Urantia Book_. His spiritual thirst was so great that he read it and thanked me. A precious connection was made!

_The Urantia Book_, which describes the universe as supporting the creation, evolution, and growth of all life in all dimensions, has guided me, even as I was reading it, to change the way I view my own life, bringing me new realizations and profound spiritual joy as an active organizer of my life, rather than a passive nobody who is dragged along by events.

Matter, mind, and spirit. When I understood how the functions of these three entities were organically connected and affecting me, the difference between soul and personality, and the relationship between the divine indwelling spirit and the material intellect, I became deeply grateful to my Thought Adjuster, who was undoubtedly an experienced one.

By the time I finished reading _The Urantia Book_, I knew the answers to questions I’d had since childhood; the biggest thing that changed for me after reading the book was that my love for God grew. Knowing that a fragment of God is in my heart has given me a great sense of security and has led me to deepen my relationship with God.

“The greatest affliction of the cosmos is never to have been afflicted. Mortals only learn wisdom by experiencing tribulation.” <a id="a64_128"></a>[UB 48:7.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_14) This epigram has been a great comfort, giving me the courage to treat misfortunes and suffering as learning episodes, and to remain serene in the knowledge that my seemingly insignificant life marches along in an orderly, intellectually progressive universe with great meaning and value.

To me, _The Urantia Book_ is a great gift from God.
