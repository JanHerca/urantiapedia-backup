O love divine, You arc the seed from which each one of us was born to life. 
Far as the stars, close as our hearts,
You are.....
Your holy Name is uttered everywhere. 
Wake us into full remembrance of Your love. 
Guide us ever to our home, which is with You, that joyous life which you have planned for us through all eternity...
The power and the glory of existence sings within us all: every atom breathes Your breath. 
May we know our holiness as Yours, forevermore. ....
Give us the certainty that all our needs are met through faith in You, whatever be Your Will for us. 
And may it be our Will to Clear the path within that leads to You, to open
every door in welcome and in trust to You, who waits within us, welcoming our remembrance, rejoicing in our love....
Forgive us, and may we bc forgiving toward ourselves, that we forget so often who we are. 
Our own true nature is a godliness; we are of You....
Others, too, who know not fully who they are and play the game of separation in so many ways, may we forgive in full, knowing that their faults are but our own...
Deliver us from all our blindnesses unto the meaning of our lives....
As lights within Your greater light, may we remember You forevcr in the now, in darkness as in day May human love complete your radiance on earth, that we may join with heaven here. Amen
