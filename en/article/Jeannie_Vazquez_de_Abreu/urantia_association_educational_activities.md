Dear Friends and Readers of _The Urantia Book_,

It is a pleasure to inform you about the latest activities of Urantia Association’s Education Committee.

We are organizing a cycle of monthly live webinars. On March 24, the Association’s Study Groups Committee Chair, Gaetan Charland, presented the theme “Improving the Quality and Effectiveness of Study Groups.” In this webinar, Gaetan explored how study groups may be improved to work toward fulfilling _The Urantia Book_’s mission, as stated in the book:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> _…to expand cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception._ <a id="a47_70"></a>[[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2)]

Our attention was brought to the challenge as stated at the end of Paper 196:

> _…The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind._ <a id="a55_133"></a>[[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34)]

To improve effectiveness in your study group, Gaetan offered the following suggestions:

- Have some clear objectives and share them with the group.
- Acquire new techniques of learning and teaching.
- Introduce new ways of studying _The Urantia Book_.
- Help students become involved in service-projects.
- Focus on spiritual and intellectual growth.
- Encourage participants of your group to make presentations to the group.
- As a host, take UBIS courses to improve your skills at facilitating your group.
- Use presentations or study aids to foster teaching skills.
- Nurture potential leaders and teachers in your groups by sharing responsibilities.
- Make your study group more dynamic by changing the format.

On April 28, the Association’s Judicial Commissioner, Benet Rutenberg, presented a webinar on “Spiritual Unity and the Spirit of Truth.”

Benet was inspired to make this presentation through two avenues of development beginning about ten years ago. He said:

> _The ongoing discussion of unity within our Urantia community is a cause with many faces, hopes and beliefs. All of these desires are well intended. And all of them require a sound foundation of spiritual truth and values, a firm structure of intellectual meanings and the necessity of being grounded in material fact. The purpose of this discussion on Spiritual Unity is to elevate our awareness and comprehension to the spiritual level so that we may sometime enjoy not only the hope of success but also the facts, meanings and values which will bring the satisfaction of spiritual growth necessary for seeking the heavenly first with all that is needful following in the wake._
> 
> _The second avenue of discovery is found in the study of The Spirit of Truth along with a more comprehensive inclusion of the related factors of: living in the presence of God—Adjuster contact, the influence of Michael’s Spirit of Truth and of the Holy Spirit, and how we relate in and to the Supreme. When we live in the presence of God we are the brotherhood of man. As these are all high spiritual realities they may be accessed only on spiritual planes. At NO time have we not had—do we not have—the possibility and the actuality of Spiritual Unity._
> 
> _When and as we live and work in partnership with God, the will of God brings forth what is needed. As a boat moves through the water, so we will move through time and into eternity. In the wake of progress, it is the strong, powerful and persistent decisions that bring us to a place where we all are united in spirit even as we work through diverse means towards the exact same ends. In the wake of faith union with the living Jesus will be found spiritual unity and all else our united wills require._
