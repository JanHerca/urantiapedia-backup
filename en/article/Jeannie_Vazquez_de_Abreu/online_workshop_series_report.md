A series of weekly online workshops on the subject, _Leadership and Teaching According to_ _The Urantia Book_ was organized by the Education Committee of Urantia Association International late last year. I would like to thank those who helped to make this an instructive and satisfying experience.

Thank you to **_Gaétan Charland_**, who presented three beautiful and instructive sessions about how to be a true spiritual leader and servant of the Urantia Revelation, living the teachings and serving others as a fruit of the spirit;

to **_Rick Lyon_**, who gave us a useful and instructive lesson about the value of social organizations of service to the spiritual fraternity;

to **_Guy Perron_**, who gave us a comprehensive instruction over four sessions about the importance of developing our inner life—going inward, upward, onward and outward in our search for God;

to **_Jeffrey Wattles_**, who instructed us over two valuable sessions about “Leadership and Teamwork,” enlightening us about the wisdom of mobilizing our powers of mind and soul before activating our physical energies in service and teaching the revelation;

to **_Chris Wood_**, who offered an amusing and enlightening lesson about “A Life of Service,” explaining the concepts of “moral duty,” “service,” “what is love?” and “what is the meaning of life?” He made us all think about these important concepts in a very smart and ingenious way;

to **_Donna Mejia_**_,_ who gave us an instructive, touching and thought-provoking lesson about “Being an Ally, Moving Beyond By-stander Syndrome and Having Courageous Conversations in the Midst of Cultural Collisions.” Donna gave us a unique opportunity to see ourselves, how we have prejudices and discriminate against others without perceiving it many times. I felt deeply touched by her intelligence and wisdom. Thank you very much, Donna!

I would also like to give a special thanks to:

- _Samantha Nior_ for her a wonderful job facilitating this Workshop Series.  
- _Susan Owen_ for her loving and constant assistance.  
- _Flor Robles_ for her steadfast service and love.  
- _Susan Lyon_ for her loving service and for sharing her joy of living with us.  
- _Pato Banton_ for sharing his beautiful and enlightening experience of service and understanding about the teachings.  
- _Antoinette Rootsdawtah_ for her loving service to our Father and the Spiritual Brotherhood.

This was a real wonderful team effort and without the involvement of all these dedicated and conscientious volunteers, we would not have been able to provide such a value-packed set of workshops. God bless you all.
