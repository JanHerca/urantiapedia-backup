The 24-hour Artists’ Urantiathon was a new and fantastic experience for me. Our community of readers and students of _The Urantia Book_ proved to be intermixed with many accomplished artists.

The inspiration of the revelation was manifested in their magnificent, creative, and beautiful works, which included music, paintings, digital art, comedy, and literature. We also shared some sublime Urantia teachings because, as my dear friend Irma Aguilar said, “_The revelation transforms men_.”

And it is true; the revelation transforms us by giving us a greater cosmic consciousness and a knowledge of universal reality. When we live the divine teachings, loving God and Jesus, we are spiritually transformed.

This Urantiathon was a one-of-a-kind event. I think it’s of great value to share the art inspired by the revelation. The love for our Father and his divine truth has stimulated many artists to create music, songs, paintings, literature, videos, beautiful images, and other artworks that reveal the inner spirit’s action in their beauty and harmony. Exhibiting this art is an excellent way to inspire our community of truth-seekers to look inside for strength and courage in these difficult times.

Living our lives in an elevated, inspired, and spiritualized way is also an art. That is why we could not miss in this Urantiathon one of the essential teachings of Jesus and the revelators—to improve the art of living, growing in love, kindness, and wisdom through worshipful communion.

Said Rodan of Alexandria:

>  _Jesus has taught us that God lives in man; then how can we induce man to release these soul-bound powers of divinity and infinity? How shall we induce men to let go of God that he may spring forth to the refreshment of our own souls while in transit outward and then to serve the purpose of enlightening, uplifting, and blessing countless other souls? How best can I awaken these latent powers for good which lie dormant in your souls?_ <a id="a52_441"></a>[[UB 160:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p3_1)]

Jesus taught his followers:

> _Worship_… _makes one increasingly like the being who is worshiped. Worship is a transforming experience whereby the finite gradually approaches and ultimately attains the presence of the Infinite._ <a id="a56_201"></a>[[UB 146:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_17)]

Prayer, as taught in _The Urantia Book,_ has an ever-increasing spiritualizing and ennobling effect on us because it is accompanied by worship. This receptive phase nourishes our soul with divine gifts in an ideal way. This silent,  effortless, receptive phase is what leads us to the contact of worshipful communion with God—the Adjuster in our superconsciousness.

The Father’s supreme mandate to us, the perfect expression of God’s will that sums up the entire ascending path, is _“Be you perfect, even as I am perfect”_ <a id="a60_157"></a>[[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3)].  To become perfect as the Father is perfect, we need to find him within us and strive to be like him, transforming and vitalizing our soul with the bread of life—the living truth, the eternal word of God—and receiving the water of life of the Spirit of Truth that nourishes and vivifies the soul, quenching our spiritual thirst.

These works of art and the shared, divine teachings are a balm to our soul, and I hope they gave the attendees an impulse to worship and to feel inspired to live increasingly the divine teachings, to be loving and spiritualized persons.

Thank you to all the artists who cheered us and inspired us with their works! May our Heavenly Father bless you abundantly for your love and generosity.

Your sister,  
Jeannie Vázquez
