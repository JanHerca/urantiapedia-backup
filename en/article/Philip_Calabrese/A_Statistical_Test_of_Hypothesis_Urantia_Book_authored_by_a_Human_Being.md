**Statistical Tests in General.** In performing any statistical test one must have an a priori probability distribution to test against. For example, knowing that wood can hardly grow unaided into the shape of a 4-legged chair in a wooded forest, if we encounter such a piece of wood in the forest then we are justified in concluding (statistically, not logically) that it was designed and built by some intelligent agent rather than that it evolved or emerged into a chair by wholly non-intelligent means. Similarly, if we flip a coin 100 times and “heads” comes up less than 33 times, then we could statistically conclude that the coin is biased toward tails because the probability of a **_fair_** coin producing 33 or less “heads” in 100 flips is 1 chance in 5000. The test is possible because we have an a priori distribution to test against concerning the number of “heads” in 100 flips of a fair coin. Assuming the “null hypothesis” of a fair coin, we calculate the low probability of a sample of at most 33 heads in 100 flips and conclude the “alternative hypothesis” that the coin is biased. 

In standard scientific statistical tests the “significance level”, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true, is set at 1/100 or even 1/25, not 1/5000, let alone much smaller numbers. A significance level is usually expressed as a percentage – 1% or 4%. However, for this test the significance level can be set to much smaller values, values equivalent to flipping 25 or fewer heads in 100 flips of a fair coin—less than 1 chance in a million. That significance level is 0.0001%. 

In contrast to having an a priori known “null” distribution, as of 24 May 2013 we do not scientifically know of life on other worlds. Nor do we scientifically know how life originated on Earth. Since we have no knowledge (let alone a distribution) about the origin of life, we have no scientific basis for estimating the probability of a world like ours having our type of life. We have no contemporary science (CS) knowledge of other worlds like ours or the percentage of worlds like ours that have life like ours. Therefore, there is no way at present to scientifically estimate the probability of life on other planets. 

Similarly, in the context of the evolution of advanced life on Earth from mysteriously complicated one-celled life, without having much knowledge of how complex organisms “emerged” from simpler ones, there is no clear way to test the hypothesis that the human eye required intelligent design due to its supposed “irreducible complexity”. 

However, there is relatively good statistical evidence of the degree of scientific error and inaccuracy in humanly written scientific books and periodicals in 1955 and earlier. Those publications have become increasingly obsolescent or erroneous over the years when new scientific discoveries were made. Therefore there is a basis for testing a 1955 book that claims, among other things, to provide scientific information of immense value to our world, help in cosmology to support a spiritual message. 

As an example of what has been phrased “scientific convergence toward statements in _The Urantia Book_ ” it is a verifiable fact that long before they were observed by human astronomers in the 1990’s, _The Urantia Book_ quite accurately described the so-called “walls” of galaxies beyond the Milky Way in far distant outer space including the huge “voids” between these “walls” or zones. It also described dark matter that it accurately said is over 90% of the mass of the cosmos, another fact only substantiated in the 1990’s. 

In hindsight, many human scientific statements written in 1955 and earlier were quite incorrect. If _The Urantia Book_ follows these, and does not avoid these human errors, then _The Urantia Book_ can be considered to be of human origin. However, if the test shows that _The Urantia Book_ has an uncanny way of avoiding errors while offering correct accounts of once doubted or mistaken science, then it becomes highly unlikely that mere humans authored. 

_The Urantia Book_, published in 1955, has predicted many subsequent scientific discoveries that were unknown or unpopular at that time while it has avoided scientific errors of that time. But has it been statistically significant? 

Mistaken science of 1955 and earlier, but now known with high confidence, can be used to answer that question. How likely is it that humans could have written _The Urantia Book_ before 1955? Rejection of this “null hypothesis” would mean acceptance of the alternate hypothesis, that human beings did not author _The Urantia Book_. 

Such a conclusion would precipitate an integrity test for both scientific and traditional religious authorities. The problem is that both institutions are too tied to the status quo philosophically and economically to be moved to recognize and accept a scientific and religious communication from superhuman sources. They are more likely to attack anything and anyone that seriously challenges their doctrines and dogmas. But scientific facts are the objective part of reality that we must all recognize or be self-deceived. 

## The Hypothesis of Human Authorship 

Null Hypothesis: _The Urantia Book_ was authored by humans. 

Alternate Hypothesis: _The Urantia Book_ was not authored by humans. 

**Definition of the Population for The Test.** The test population consists of all well-established, present day (as of 24 May 2013) scientific statements for which the following are true: 
1. The statement contains well-established information that only a minority of 1/3 or less of scientists espoused prior to 1955. Call these “reversal statements” of contemporary science. 
2. _The Urantia Book_ (1955) expresses a definite opinion concerning the post-1955 scientifically established information. 
3. The reversal statements are (probabilistically) independent of one another. 

**Qualifications on the Test Procedure.** For a valid test it is essential that the reversal statement selection process not bias the sample of the population. Ideally, all present day, well-established “scientific reversals” would be covered by the reversal statement list thereby eliminating one form of selection bias. Otherwise a sufficiently large, unbiased (random) sample of this population must be used. Skeptics of the superhuman authorship are encouraged to offer examples of reversal statements that _The Urantia Book_ did not get right by today’s (CS) standards. This is an ongoing process that can be regularly updated as new scientific discoveries and reversal statements are made. 

Since the reversal statements must be independent of each other, there is some judgment in covering a topic that contains two or more loosely related statements. For example, in covering new information about the outer space galaxies, besides the numbers of galaxies, there are the related facts of large-scale structures among them, the huge voids, and high percentage of dark matter holding the spinning galaxies together, all predicted by _The Urantia Book_. How many independent statements should cover the outer space galaxies? 

Another area requiring some judgment involves deciding whether there is enough convergence toward (or divergence away from) the position expressed in _The Urantia Book_ to count it as a “success” (or failure). 

Another area of judgment is deciding whether a present day scientific position is really well established or based more on scientific dogma. For example, although in 2013 a majority of all scientists are supposedly of the opinion that life emerged from non-living matter with no superhuman involvement, there is no scientific proof of that. It is not scientifically “well established”. Showing that electrical stimulation of simple atoms and compounds can produce more complex but non-living hydrocarbons that are essential to living things does not demonstrate or prove that life emerged randomly out of the primordial chemical soup. 

Because CS is an ever-growing and reforming body of knowledge the contribution of individual statements to the statistical conclusion may shift back and forth over the years. Therefore this test should be rerun periodically as more science is discovered. Nevertheless, the overall convergence of CS toward the science of _The Urantia Book_ is already apparent over the decades between 1955 and 5/24/2013.   

**Estimation of Probabilities.** In theory, for each scientific reversal statement, there is a historical record of the percentage of scientific authors who espoused (published) the present day, contemporary scientific understanding. This percentage, expressed as a fraction, can be interpreted as the probability that a human author at the time would espouse the present day scientific account of the information. The number 1 minus this fraction is the probability that a human author at the time would express doubt or something mostly incorrect compared to present day scientific understanding. This is the “probability of human doubt or error” for the associated reversal statement. 

Nevertheless, certain very helpful simplifications can be made for the test that are designed to only increase the probability of accepting human authorship and which therefore, maintain the significance level of the test. That is, the probability of falsely rejecting human authorship is not increased by the following simplifications.   

**Simplifications of the Test Data.** It will not bias the sample, but will greatly simplify historical data collection, to _restrict the population_ to all (and only) those scientific “reversal statements” for which, according to present day (CS) scientific knowledge, 2/3 or more of the scientific opinions in 1955 were wrong or expressed ignorance. (That eliminates 50-50 questions.)

Secondly, to any statement whose fraction of incorrect human scientific opinions in 1955 was even greater than 2/3 it will suffice to assign the same 2/3 value as though 1/3 of human scientists at the time expressed the correct opinion. This will give to the null hypothesis any benefit in likelihood due to this simplification. 

Thus reversal statements will be restricted to those for which the probability of a correct human opinion prior to 1955 is less than 1/3, and all those will be assigned 1/3 no matter how less likely humans were to write correctly in 1955. 

**The Test.** With the above simplifications, the statistical test can be done using a binomial distribution with the probability of failure equal to 2/3 for each of the reversal statements. 

We can think of this test as rolling an ordinary six-sided die having numbers 1 through 6 on its faces. The number of rolls N of the die will be the number of independent reversal statements. For any reversal statement, human error will be represented by the die faces with numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4. The faces with 5 or 6 will represent correct human statements. Thus in the “N rolls of a die” model the probability of human error (failure) on any roll is p = 2/3 and so 1/3 is the probability of a correct human statement (success). 

There are now online calculators[^0] for the binomial distributions that will output the probability of rolling fewer than some number X of failures (1, 2, 3 or 4) in N rolls of a die. For example, for a run of 48 rolls, the probability of less than X=21 failures is 0.000329, which is less than 1 chance in 3,000. 

**Independent Statements for Testing.** The following reversal statements have been grouped into independent examples. For example, calculating the sizes of a proton and an electron and the electron orbit size are considered related (not independent) questions: Knowing the answer to one affects the probability of knowing the answer to the others. Therefore they are not independent, and so they are lumped together in item 5. There is an endnote for each item that gives the relevant Paper:Section.paragraphs in _The Urantia Book_ along with other references establishing the reversal statement. 

The letter “C” (for convergence, success), or the letter “D” (for divergence, failure) has been placed after most items indicating a tentative assignment. A question mark “?” indicates that present day understanding is not well enough established, or that there is some, but not enough, convergence or divergence, or that there is some other question about the reversal statement. This category will not be used for the test but will be used to identify potential future examples of reversal statements of CS.

**The Test.** There are 39 C’s, 9 D’s and 2 question marks out of a total of 50 items. 

This is like rolling 9 or less failures (1, 2, 3, or 4) out of 48 rolls of a fair die with the probability of failure on each chance being at least 2/3. The probability of doing this by pure chance is essentially zero. Even getting fewer than 13 failures in 48 rolls is 2 chances in 100 million, one chance in 50 million. (By rolling 8 fair dice 6 times this experiment can easily be done to see how many failures come up in 48 rolls of a single die.) 

Therefore the null hypothesis of human authorship of _The Urantia Book_ is easily rejected at the 0.0001 percent significance level, which is 1 chance in a million. In fact, the probability in this test of falsely rejecting the human authorship is less than one chance in 50 million. 

**Conclusions.** The amount of superhuman scientific knowledge imparted in _The Urantia Book_ was carefully designed to be “of immense value” but “not inspired”. Filling in some gaps in our knowledge, telling us about our own history, providing an authoritative elimination of some errors, providing some soon to be discovered science, and coordinating little known human knowledge—in this way _The Urantia Book_ intends to provide a better cosmological context in which to understand the spiritual revelation of _The Urantia Book_, a retelling and an expansion of the life and gospel of Jesus. 

For some folks, this simple statistical test will not be enough of a reason to believe in _The Urantia Book_ as an actual book of revelation from God. After all, many closeminded people who witnessed the superhuman feats of Jesus attributed them to the devil. Our religious brothers—the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims—are free to imagine that Lucifer and Satan are trying to deceive them with this superhuman information. However, they could judge the book in the way that Jesus recommended, by the quality of its fruits. 

In that regard, they should know that _The Urantia Book_ preaches the Gospel of Jesus (the spiritual Fatherhood of God and the spiritual equality of all people), and further, that loving service to one’s fellows is the spiritual fruit of knowing God and living God’s love. 

> Phil Calabrese found _The Urantia Book_ in 1970, and it was “love at first sight.” He has authored numerous papers and presentations on the book, especially on its unique cosmology, and he initiated and taught the first for-credit college course based on _The Urantia Book_. Phil has a PhD in mathematics, and has served as an aerospace analyst. His personal company, Data Synthesis, won a prime contract with the US Navy to develop techniques for reasoning with uncertainty, techniques he later applied to quantum logic. He continues to review papers on the foundations of quantum logic for the American Mathematical Society’s Mathematical Reviews.
