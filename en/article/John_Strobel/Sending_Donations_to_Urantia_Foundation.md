_By John Strobel, Illinois, United States_

Have you ever donated to a charity only to find out later that the CEO is making millions, or they are spending a huge percentage on “marketing”? You may feel like your money was being wasted or spent on something other than the charity's mission. Well, rest assured that your money donated to Urantia Foundation is wisely spent to spread _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings around the world.

Hi, I'm John Strobel, and I'm sure you know my wife Joanne, who has been serving the Urantia Revelation for six years here in Chicago. Although I only pitch in where needed at 533 , I have spent enough time there to know that every dollar donated is greatly appreciated, budgeted judiciously, and frugally managed. When discussing expenditures (whether it is buying new equipment or just replenishing the coffee supply), I have often heard staff admonishing one another to remember that this is donors' money being spent. As a monthly donor myself, it has always made me feel good that my time and financial contributions are really respected.

> Today, when many of us are reviewing our charitable contributions, you may be confident that your loving gifts to Urantia Foundation are treasured, valued, and wisely administered.
