> “_But no God-knowing mortal can ever be lonely in his journey through the cosmos, for he knows that the Father walks beside him each step of the way, while the very way that he is traversing is the presence of the Supreme._” (<a id="a36_228"></a>[UB 117:6.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_27))

Like water seeks a point located lower than its source, thus the Infinite can spread toward the finite, flowing downwards in space-time. The Supreme should be then the centrifugal movement of Infinity toward the Finite, and the Supremacy the centripetal reaction of the finite creation to the call of the Infinite.

An isolated pole can't give any current. That is why the Supreme exteriorizes himself only by virtue of the simultaneous existence of the Finite and Infinite as a current between two potentials immensely removed by which his power (Almighty 5upreme) pulls us up from fugitive realities of space-time, up to the realms of spaceless and timeless realities of Paradise.

Each enthronement of the kingdom in the core of the mortal mind of the finite creatures is an increasing of the power of the Almighty Supreme in space-time creation. And this must be seen as the ministry of the Sevenfold Deity toward space-time-bound creatures.

God is spirit. Mortal beings are material and power is needed to raise them to spirit. That power will have achieved its purpose when the entire time-space creation will be settled in light and life. But the Infinite can not be reached through finite values, which is only the beginning of the super-finite reslization of the Ultimate, and even still the Ultimate cannot be the attainment of the Infinite.

### Infinite To Finite

The faith-vision of God-knowing persons reveals the indwelling presence of the Father, the Thought Adjuster. Such an association between an Absolute mind and a finite mind makes possible the realization of a new reality: the evolving immortal soul, the medium of a time-creature and an eternal being. The simultaneous existence of Absolute Deity and all the finite creatures' minds makes possible the eventuation of the super-soul of creation, the Supreme Being, who evolves by and in them, led by the Paradise Trinity: “_The Mystery Monitors are to human beings what the Paradise Trinity is to the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a48_617"></a>[UB 116:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p3_4))

Such a process makes evident the close interdependence between our evolution and the revelation of God in space-time, the Supreme Being. Likewise, the evolution of the mortal mind is essential for the soul while led by the Thought Adjuster. “_...it appears that all human progress is effected by a technique of conjoint revelational evolution._” (<a id="a50_347"></a>[UB 196:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_15)) Whereas a fusion is possible between a mortal and his Mystery Monitor, could a homologous miracle happen between the Supreme and Existential Deity? It seems that it is quite different, according to the papers: the Supreme Being will individualize himself like a real personality knowable by creatures and knowing them.

### Integrating Truth, Beauty, Goodness

The attributes of divinity are understandable for the finite creatures as truth, beauty, and goodness in the divine personality of the Paradise Father. God the Supreme, endowed with the Almighty Supreme and Supreme Mind attributes, cognizable as one unified personality in the future as the Supreme Being, will represent the conjugated natures of the Creator and the creatures, the truth, the beauty, and the goodness perfectly integrated in the experience of a finite being.

It's a great privilege to be called to participate in the growth of the Supreme in the present age, and increasingly in our hearts should develop the awakening of cosmic morality, the universal duty toward the Supreme Being, feeling which is the response of the creature to the infinite love of the Father.

> “_Man can discover the Father in his heart, but he will have to search for the Supreme in the hearts of all other men;_” (<a id="a58_124"></a>[UB 117:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_23))
