## 2020 ANZURA Conference

I am happy to relate that things are going well in New Zealand and preparations/organisation is well underway for the ANZURA conference in Auckland next year (2020). We are using the same venue as our last New Zealand ANZURA conference, Vaughan Park, which is in the northern beach suburbs of Auckland.  ([https://vaughanpark.nz/venue](https://vaughanpark.nz/venue))


## Gathering of New Zealand Readers, Villa Ika, Taupo

Each year NZ readers try to get together somewhere in the country to connect with old and new readers for study and socialisation. This year from Friday 25<sup>th</sup> to Monday 28<sup>th</sup> October, we gathered in Taupo at a lovely Airbnb.

Attendees were: (see photo) Neville Twist, Frances Potter, Susan Hemmingsen, Matt Hall, Norman Weiss, Diana Whakapapa, Ian Campbell and sitting in the front, Marion Steward.  Missing from this photo, Doug Cook, who joined us on Saturday. It was so good to meet the two new members of our online study group, Diana and Norman, in person and to find they are long-time readers and valuable members of our NZ group.

The programme was, as usual, fairly loose, but on the agenda were a couple of sessions dealing with next year’s ANZURA conference theme, “2020 Vision Through a Cosmic Lens: Hindsight, Insight and Foresight.”

Marion lead these discussions with her trusty notebook and laptop on hand and there was valuable and lively input from all. We all felt confident with the theme, the agenda and the activities planned for the conference and we look forward to seeing you there.

There was quite a bit of study too and we completed Paper 112, Personality Survival (continued from section 4. Adjusters After Death).

Saturday evening was spent (by majority rule) watching the All Blacks lose to England!

For me, it is always a thrill to spend time with other readers where I can feel free to discuss anything, knowing I can use references and quotes from _The Urantia Book_ and that they will be accepted by all.

Ian had to dash off early Sunday morning after a phone call saying his daughter was in labour in Auckland. He is now the proud grandfather of a lovely baby boy. Congratulations Ian and Robyn.



## Online Study Groups

Our regular online study group has just changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The study group runs from 7.00 to 8.30 pm and the link to join the meeting is: [https://zoom.us/j/2212675799](https://zoom.us/j/2212675799). The Papers are usually chosen beforehand and it usually takes more than one session to complete each Paper as we have an option for anyone to input personal experiences, insights or questions as we go.

Diana is wanting to start a “face-to-face” group in Gisborne where participants (from any religion) are able to share their spiritual experiences. If you are interested in joining Diana’s group, please contact her: Diana Whakapapa, [diana@normandiana.net.nz](mailto:diana@normandiana.net.nz).
