_By Melissa Wells, Associate Editor_

You may have already noticed many changes in this issue of _The Study Group Herald_. In the few years of its life, this newsletter has been lovingly nurtured by Marty Greenhut as managing editor. His watchcare has made this publication well respected in the Urantia movement.

Regrettably, Marty has made the choice to resign this responsibility in light of a good career opportunity. It was a tough decision for Marty and we can't thank him enough for his hard work to launch this publication. He performed wonders in making this an international voice of study groups of _The Urantia Book_.

Our new managing editor is Carol Hay, who is well known for her vocal talent and gift of oratory shared at conferences of the Fellowship. Carol resides in Boulder, Colorado and is active in many projects of the Rocky Mountain Society. To mention a few, she works with The Women's Corps, _The Invisible Fellowship_ magazine, teenagers study groups and seminars introducing _The Urantia Book_.

You'll see Carol's handiwork in the next issue of the _Herald_, which will focus on how the Urantia movement celebrates the 2,000th year of the birth of Michael of Nebadon as the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Please send Carol pictures and stories of your group's activities.

With this issue, we take a look at family life values. Two topical studies focus on the complementarity of men and women, by Larry Watkins and Claudia Ayers, and the sensitive issue of abortion. Whether you're pro or con, more than likely you can find quotes from _The Urantia Book_ to support your views. This is one thesis developed by a study group in Oregon.

Of interest to parents, we have interviewed some teens who talk frankly about the issues they are facing in the 90s.

Also in this issue, the Family Life ad hoc committee of the Fellowship is publishing a survey on family lifestyles. Please take a moment to complete this survey and return it to the Fellowship office. Your response will help this committee develop its strategy to support and assist readers of _The Urantia Book_ in achieving optimal family life experiences.

Our presentation of the study groups in Arizona is timely since our next international conference —IC'96 — is going to be set in the highlands of Flagstaff, Arizona.

Let us know what you think of The Study Group Herald. Send us your likes, your dislikes, your happy stories or sad ones. And please send pictures.
