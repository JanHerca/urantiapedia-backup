**By Melissa Wells**
**Raleigh, North Carolina**

We've all had heroes. As kids we had Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Superman, Mickey Mantle ... the list goes on and on. Our heroes were there for us, bigger than life, able to handle any difficulty, always emerging victorious.

We felt safe with our heroes. We aspired to be like them. We needed them.

The years have passed since I dreamed and talked about my heroes, but the need hasn't disappeared. In fact, as an adult, I've relied on my heroes more than ever. But I've rolled the qualities I loved so much in my many heroes into one person. And thanks to the unique presentation of Jesus that I discovered in _The Urantia Book_, he is the hero to beat all heroes.

He's one of us, yet bigger than life. Facing all the problems life can offer, and tirelessly achieving that which seems impossible. Always landing on his feet, and when faced with defeat, handling it gracefully and moving forward to the next challenge, all the better prepared.

That's how I want to be.

But when the going gets tough, all my shortcomings surface just when I need most to rely on my inner strengths.

In my studies I've discovered that my hero, Jesus, is willing to walk with me through any situation. In my life I've found this to be true. And in my heart this experience creates a gratitude beyond expression, because my hero does for me what I can't do for myself.

## Jesus The Steadfast

In all my studies of Jesus, I've learned most from his ability to face and work through life's challenges. While I respect and adore the divinity in his nature, it is his human response to the very problems which I've also faced that inspires me to work a little harder.

When I read in _The Urantia Book_ of the difficulties Jesus faced while raising his siblings and the financial pressures that came along with this responsibility, it has helped me in no small measure to know that I pray to someone who understands what it's like for me as a single mom.

When I lost my job and faced the challenge of finding another position, with no real positive leads and two children absolutely dependent upon me for their well being, again it helped to have my hero to look to for guidance and inspiration.

> “Apparently all Jesus' plans for a career were thwarted. The future did not look bright as matters now developed. But he did not falter; he was not discouraged. He lived on, day by day, doing well the present duty and faithfully discharging the immediate responsibilities of his station in life.” ([UB 126:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_4))

The manner in which my next job - the beginning of a true career - unfolded relayed that my hero and his helpers had a hand in that important next step of my life.

## Jesus The Sincere

I don't like anyone to question my motives or actions. In family life, that happens a lot. But again I learned from Jesus how to handle suspicion and mistrust.

> “True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism ... Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true convictions and noble ideals. ” (<a id="a73_225"></a>[UB 146:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_2))

> “Let us be patient; the truth never suffers from honest examination.” (<a id="a75_73"></a>[UB 153:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p2_11))

When my mother critically questioned my reasons for separating from my husband and depriving my children of a close relationship with their father, I felt powerless to show her my side of the story. But I faced her tirades of anger, I didn't wither before her misinterpretations of fact, and gently was able to help her see that I was only doing my best in a bad situation. All the while, during those moments of conflict, I held onto images of Jesus standing forthright and representing the truth as he knew it. And it gave me strength to face one of the most important people in my life who had temporarily lost faith in me.

## Jesus The Strategist

It never ceases to amaze me how Jesus could so successfully handle the attempts of his enemies to embarrass him in public. Such wisdom, such agility, such clear reasoning are a wonder to me. And I love him all the more for that, because I have so little of it, except in my ability to appreciate it in him.

> “Jesus would have good-naturedly managed the crowd and effectively disarmed even his violent enemies ... Jesus had long taught the apostles that a soft answer turns away wrath.” (<a id="a83_181"></a>[UB 150:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p9_3))

> “On both friends and foes he exercised a strong and peculiarly fascinating influence. Multitudes would follow him for weeks, just to hear his gracious words and behold his simple life. Devoted men and women loved Jesus with a well-nigh superhuman affection. And the better they knew him the more they loved him. And all this is still true; even today and in all future ages, the more man comes to know this God-man, the more he will love and follow after him.” (<a id="a85_464"></a>[UB 149:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_14))

## Jesus, My Friend

One of my favorite childhood experiences is when I, as the big sister, attempted to teach my younger siblings about Jesus. I acted the schoolmarm and sat the rowdy young boys down to teach them about the Son of God. The exercise warmed my heart and later that night, as I lay in bed to go to sleep, Jesus' spirit came and befriended me.

That connection has led to many moments of closeness, of learning how to become absolutely dependent on the one who is my spiritual mentor, savior, the center and circumference of all that is good in my life.

## His Promise

My favorite testimony among people trying to live by God's will is to talk about what happened when I hit bottom. All that I had done on my own for success in life failed. When the moment of truth came and I realized that I had to stop running from life and grow up, I made yet another bargain with God. Only this time I meant it.

I prayed to him, “Since I can't escape this problem, I'll face it, but I want to know that you're really going to be there to help me.” And ever since then I've known that I have help from a power far greater than myself. My hero is the best, and he can be yours, too, just for the asking.

> “‘To you and to all who shall follow in your steps down through the ages, let me say: I always stand near, and my invitation-call is, and ever shall be, Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am true and loyal, and you shall find spiritual rest for your souls.’” <a id="a99_347"></a>[UB 163:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_7)

> “And they found the Master's words to be true when they put his promises to the test. And since that day countless thousands also have tested and proved the surety of these same promises.” (<a id="a101_192"></a>[UB 163:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_8))
