July 28, 1974

The duties of the Secretary-General remain the same as in previous years -- namely, handling office detail, routine correspondence, buying supplies and keeping the inventory, making deposits for the Corporation, and so on. The only difference this year is that the work is much heavier. Book sales, correspondence, in fact, everything is increasing.

The only new office equipment we have added in the last year is a Pitney Bowes mailing machine and an electric adding machine, also two typewriter stands.
