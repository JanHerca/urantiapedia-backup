August 3, 1973

The work of the Secretary-General's office goes on as usual, but each year there is a little more of it. For those of you who are not familiar with my job, I handle routine mail, do the filing, buy office supplies, attend committee meetings (I am an ex officio member of all committees, except Education of which I am a regular member), and I keep the records of the Executive Committee, of which I am Secretary. I am also Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation which means that I receive money, keep some of the records, and make deposits.

Book sales are increasing steadily. Now most books are going to bookstores rather than individuals. Leone Sadler, Chief Custodian, handles all of the book sales and keeps the records, assisted by Helen Carlson. We have a fairly large reserve fund for gift books and some of those go out each year. Many gift books have been given to libraries and now many libraries are buying the book.

The additions in the way of office equipment consist of a large safe, a secretary's desk, and two steno chairs. We also have bought three Selectric typewriters, one of which was stolen a month after we received it. All of this equipment is owned jointly with the Foundation. A more efficient type of postage meter has just been installed which will simplify the work of mailing the books.
