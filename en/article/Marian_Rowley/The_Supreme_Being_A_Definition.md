According to _The URANTIA Book_, the Supreme Being is an evolutionary Deity. He will have an eternal future but, unlike the Father, Son, and Spirit, he did have a beginning. At the present time he is not complete. He is evolving along with all of us and what we do has an influence on his evolution.

The best concise definition of the Supreme is as follows: “_The Supreme Being is the unification of three phases of Deity reality: God the Supreme, the spiritual unification of certain finite aspects of the Paradise Trinity; the Almighty Supreme, the power unification of the grand universe Creators; and the Supreme Mind, the individual contribution of the Third Source and Center and his co-ordinates to the reality of the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a38_443"></a>[UB 22:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p7_11))

_God the Supreme_ is present right now in Havona, but is not contactible. We will not see him or speak to him when we are in Havona. Master Spirit Number Seven, our own Master Spirit, speaks for him. The principal purpose of our sojourn on the sixth circle of Havona is to get a deeper appreciation of God the Supreme through Master Spirit Number Seven. God the Supreme is now expanding outward in God the Sevenfold.

_The Almighty Supreme_ is located in the superuniverses. He could not start evolving until they were in existence. His evolution depends upon the evolution of all the beings and all the physical parts of the superuniverses — the stabilization of power, both physical and administrative. He draws his very being from the acts of God the Sevenfold and the Sevenfold Controllers.

_Supreme Mind_, bestowed by the Infinite Spirit, coordinates God the Supreme, the spirit-personality part in Havona, and the Almighty Supreme, the power-evolutionary part in the superuniverses. Whenever spirit and matter exist together and work in combination, there has to be mind, to make it possible for the two to exist and get along together.

When all the superuniverses become settled in light and life, the Almighty Supreme, the power part, will be complete. And only then will the power part, the Almighty Supreme, and the spirit personality part, God the Supreme, unified by Supreme Mind, operate as one being, the Supreme Being — the completed, unified, evolutionary Deity, who will probably take up residence on Uversa, our superuniverse capital.
