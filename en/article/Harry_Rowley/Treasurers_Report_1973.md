The Urantia Brotherhood Corporation is the financial agent of the Urantia Brotherhood. All money contributed to the Brotherhood and all money paid out by the Brotherhood is handled through the Urantia Brotherhood Corporation. The Urantia Foundation is a separate organization and keeps its own financial records. Any money received by the Brotherhood for the Foundation is transferred immediately to the Foundation and is not included in this report.

The Corporation, for the three years ending December 31, 1972, has received in approximate figures the following income: $22,600 in contributions; $900 in tithes from the Urantia Societies; $2,300 from the sale of textbooks, and $2,800 from miscellaneous sources. This gave the Corporation an income of $28,600 for the three-year period.

During the same period the Corporation paid out $36,900 for home office expenses as follows: $18,000 for rent; $9,650 for telephone, postage, and office supplies; $6,450 for office salaries; $1,100 for legal fees; and $1,700 for miscellaneous expenses.

The Corporation is the agent for the sale of the Urantia Book and during the three-year span ending December 31, 1972, we sold 16,411 books for $190,800. We paid the Urantia Foundation $152,200 for these books. For the three-year span ending December 31, 1969, we reported the sale of 5,306 Urantia.

$20,000 was transferred to the Foundation in 1971 for the third printing . We anticipate the transfer of another $20,000 in 1973 for the fourth printing.

The Corporation publishes an annual report every January showing the income and expenses for the previous year. This report is mailed with the quarterly Bulletin to all members of the Brotherhood and other interested persons. Our financial records are audited annually and are open to the inspection of any member of the Urantia Brotherhood.
