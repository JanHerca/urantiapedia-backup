The Finnish Urantia Association had a booth at the Minä Olen book fair in Helsinki. Minä Olen means “I Am.” It is one of the most popular book fairs in Finland. We had the Finnish hardcover and softcover with the Swedish book in the middle. There were also brochures in both languages and our quarterly magazine, “Heijaste.”

At the Gaia Book Fair in Rastatt, Germany, there was a Urantia Book booth where copies of Das Urantia Buch and Geburt einer Offenbarung (The Birth of a Revelation) were sold.

In Frankfort, Germany, the German Urantia Book readers held their sixth gathering at the Hotel Monopol. “We read the first two papers of the book. Christian Ruch led the group and facilitated our discussions. We decided it was time to form an association for the German speaking readers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.”

“On Saturday evening we had a quiet moment of remembrance for Werner Sutter, the man who got all of this going seven years ago; a devoted student of _The Urantia Book_ and a loyal son of God.”
