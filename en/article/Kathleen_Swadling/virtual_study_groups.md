The era of virtual study groups and conferences is upon us! With the entire world in lockdown due to the Covid-19 Coronavirus, unexpected opportunities have been arising in Urantia Book reader communities. Students are discovering how easy it is to meet with other readers from all over the world from the comfort of their own homes! Thanks to conference calling programs such as Zoom, study groups and conferences are happening with very little organization at virtually no cost. 

## Urantiathons – 24-Hour Online Conference Events 

“Urantiathon” is a new phrase that’s been coined to describe events like the two recent online 24-hour conferences that were held via Zoom and sponsored by Urantia Association International—one on 21<sup>st</sup> March (_A Reward of Isolation_) and the other on 2<sup>nd</sup> May (_We’re in this Together_).  

Various volunteers around the world took shifts in hosting different segments of the meeting according to their time zones. Each host acted as an MC where they introduced the speakers, facilitated discussion times, and basically kept things running smoothly.

Those who were able to check in during their “awake” hours would have seen how they operate; 24 hourly presentations were scheduled where the presenters would share their material just as they would in a face-to-face meeting. They were able to present graphics, videos, and Power Point presentations just as they would in a physical meeting, as well as conducting interactive discussions. For those who chose to keep their videos turned on meant that people could see and talk to each other. So many marveled at being able to see and catch up with old friends they hadn’t seen in years. 

The presentations were recorded and most have been uploaded (or are in the process of being uploaded) to Urantia Association’s YouTube channel:

> _Personality cannot very well perform in isolation. Man is innately a social creature; he is dominated by the craving of belongingness. It is literally true,_ “No man lives unto himself.” <a id="a73_190"></a>[[UB 112:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_16)] 

> _Short seasons of retreat from the busy scenes of life may not be seriously dangerous, but prolonged isolation of personality is most undesirable._ <a id="a75_150"></a>[[UB 100:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_8)]
