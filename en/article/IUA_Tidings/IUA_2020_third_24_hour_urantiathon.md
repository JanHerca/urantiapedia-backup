In the same vein as the previous series of 24-hour Urantiathons, a third one was held to celebrate Jesus’ birthday on the 21<sup>st</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> of August.   

The program featured 24 one-hour presentations given by Urantia Book students from 17 countries including the United States, Colombia (SA), Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Israel, Germany, Ghana, Uganda, Ireland, Senegal, Switzerland, Spain, Guatemala, Ecuador, Canada, and Brazil.  

Hundreds of Urantia Book readers from all corners of the globe came together for this event. Around 1,000 people joined via Zoom at various times during the 24 hours, and Facebook reported 500 viewers. It was truly heart-warming to see so many people delighting in the social contact with new and old friends in celebration of our hero Michael of Nebadon starting out on his journey to complete his final bestowal as Jesus of Nazareth on Urantia. At times it felt like a great big study group. What a privilege to be able to do such a thing while so many of us are in isolation.  

Urantia Association hosted the event, which was another in the series of coordinated online conferences alternating between the Education Committees of Urantia Foundation, the Urantia Book Fellowship, and Urantia Association as well as part of the continued classes of Urantia University Institute. One presentation was dedicated to a panel discussion of the future of education within the Urantia Community.  

The event was interactive in Zoom and was also live streamed to Facebook. There was plenty of opportunity for questions and discussion at the end of each presentation. Each presentation was recorded and will be uploaded to the Association’s YouTube channel as separate videos once editing has been completed.
