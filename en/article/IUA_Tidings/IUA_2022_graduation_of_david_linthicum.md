## “A Mighty Oak Has Fallen”

Long time devoted Urantia Book student and servant David Linthicum graduated from Urantia in the early morning hours June 1, 2022. He was informed of cancer earlier this year and selected aggressive therapy, bravely giving his all, in hopes the healing process would emerge victorious over time. David kept a wonderful, positive attitude throughout the months of treatment, and met the trials of illness and impending death with a calm dignity, true courage, generosity, steadfast faith, and hope for eternal life.

David continued to his last precious days on Earth to give his time and resources to important legacy projects he had been involved with. He was a dedicated servant to mankind. Perhaps not too many people know that David wrote and self-published a book titled “[The Emerging Recognition of Jesus’ Divine Nature](https://cosmiccreations.biz/collections/educational/products/the-emerging-recognition-of-jesus-divine-nature-compiled-by-david-linthicum).”

David helped charter the Spirit of Oklahoma Urantia Association, as well as serving as its president. He was a regular study partner with a group in Tulsa, Oklahoma. David served two terms as President of Urantia Association of the United States (UAUS), as well as Dissemination Chair for Urantia Association International. He helped found the Prisoner Inquiry Response Team (PIRT) and served as its Director for many years, as well as becoming a volunteer who personally answered letters and gave support to many prison inmates.

In more recent months David became the first Vice President of _Worldwide Ministry of Jesus_, a nonprofit established to provide funding for the _[Center for Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqDBkp-QyOA)_ projects, including the _Jesus Museum_, the _Jesus Metaverse_, _Cinematic Jesus_, and the immersive virtual _Experience Jesus_. His generous support of the _Center for Unity_ will be one of his legacy projects as the plans continue to move forward with new energy and momentum. We offer our heart-felt condolences to David’s beloved wife Regina, his son Jerod, daughter Lacey, his grandchildren and extended family. We know they are experiencing a profound loss, as are his many friends from all avenues of life. David was a Navy veteran, an outdoorsman with a love of sports and nature. David’s incredible work ethic followed him through his career as a Project Manager at Chevron, and impacted his life as a volunteer for many worthy causes. He was described by his son Jerod as a “caregiver” for anyone in need, and a source of “unconditional love.” He truly was a man of God with a servant’s heart.

In a recent conversation David expressed an interest about what his first assignment would be upon his resurrection to a new spiritual life on high. That’s our David; always eager to serve. We certainly look forward to a joyful reunion with him in eternity.

**David Linthicum**—**Director** for the Prisoner Inquiry Response Team (PIRT–a Urantia Association International Dissemination Subcommittee)

“Over the past seventeen years a small committee of extremely dedicated Urantia Association members have been quietly going about the business of disseminating _The Urantia Book_ to those who find themselves in the deepest, darkest of places, our nation’s prisons.” This is David’s description of PIRT, which was one of his passion projects. Here is a sampling of the abundant fruit from his labor of love:

In concert with his other notable service, David Linthicum served as the PIRT Director for twelve of its seventeen-year history, and not only as Director, but as a PIRT team member and volunteer himself. PIRT is the longest running dissemination project in Urantia Association’s history. The team has answered over 5300 inmate letters and disseminated more than 2,700 Urantia Books. David did this. Not alone of course; there is an amazing list of volunteers who served with him over the years. Still, I believe it was his strong leadership that kept the committee together, unbroken, for so long. He championed for its support at the board level and with that support a platform was built, upon which hundreds of inmates have written to share how profoundly _The Urantia Books_ that we send out, has changed them.

Here are some of David’s words from a 2014 Tidings article about PIRT:

_“Over the years some have asked me why so much time and energy is being devoted to prisoners. Are we not casting pearls before swine? In response to these types of questions I refer the reader to Jesus’ own admonition to his Apostles:_

> _“And mark well my words: I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners. The Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but to minister and to bestow his life as the gift for all. I declare to you that I have come to seek and to save those who are lost.”_ [cf. [Matt. 9:13b](/en/Bible/Matthew/9#v13); [Mark 2:17](/en/Bible(Mark/2#v17)); [Luke 5:32](/en/Bible/Luke/5#v32), [19:10](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v10); <a id="a68_409"></a>[UB 157:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p6_9)]

_This is the service PIRT endeavors to foster and carry forward, to minister to those who sit in darkness and to offer them the saving truths of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Jesus was adamant that he was here to seek out the sinners, the lost coin, to welcome the prodigal son’s return and save the lost sheep._

> _“Jesus was very partial to telling these three stories at the same time. He presented the story of the lost sheep to show that, when men unintentionally stray away from the path of life, the Father is mindful of such lost ones and goes out, with his Sons, the true shepherds of the flock, to seek the lost sheep. He then would recite the story of the coin lost in the house to illustrate how thorough is the divine searching for all who are confused, confounded, or otherwise spiritually blinded by the material cares and accumulations of life. And then he would launch forth into the telling of this parable of the lost son, the reception of the returning prodigal, to show how complete is the restoration of the lost son into his Father’s house and heart.”_ <a id="a72_763"></a>[[UB 169:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_15) 169:1.15]

**Comments from fellow Urantia Book students:**

_Another bright light has gone out on our world. Godspeed, good and faithful servant._ – Joanne Strobel

---

_I’m sorry about David, yet I’m happy that his eternal future will be so bright. We all likely said goodbye to David in our own way. While our thoughts and prayers went with him, we will all share in a common feeling of knowing he is gone and missing the largeness of his life’s footprint._ _Our cup (the PIRT one that David sent to us) continues to runneth over with our spiritual freedom, as was the intention for each of us as we share the good news with those who earnestly search for the truth. You did a good job, David. Now onward to your next assignment! With all our love…_  – Maramis Choufani

_It was a little over 4 months ago when David announced his illness to the Prisoner Inquiry Response Team. I am grateful for the time we had before his passing to express our heartfelt appreciation to him. He will be remembered well on Urantia and when met on high it will no doubt be said “well done good and faithful servant.” He served the revelation well and was a splendid example of what it is to be in partnership with God. You’re loved and will be sorely missed, David!_ – Jeanette Schafer

---

_This news is bittersweet. I will miss David’s wisdom. For me, he demonstrated how experience, attenuated by intelligence, patience, tolerance, and love, leads to true wisdom. David is indeed a “good and faithful servant” and will continue to be so. This certainly leaves me feeling happy. He is in good hands. –_ Chris Gravel, PIRT Canada.

---

_Such nice comments about the lovable David! You all reflect much of what I feel also. He is the one person who arrested my attention thinking about how valuable prisoners are also to God! His thought on that eventually led me to sign up for PIRT. Thank you, David. God’s speed via your Guardian goin’ to Mansonia!!!! –_ Mark Kurtz

_This is heartbreaking. David has been special to all of us. David was a truly faithful person and met death with such courage and dignity. He was a great man of service to others, and an inspiration for me._ 

_David was also the director of our prison ministry team, PIRT – Prisoner Inquiry Response Team. David answered inmate letters for many years and realized a real despair among the inmates that touched his heart to help create and continue the ministry for them. He believed that each one could be comforted by knowing they were valued and worthy children of God. I’ve been a team member for a couple of years now, because I was so inspired by the work they do._

_David called last Friday and could only speak in a raspy whisper but he was always very kind to me. He said he wondered what our first assignment would be on the mansion worlds. He was very excited to find out. There certainly is a new light on those far off distant shores._ – Susan Lyon

---

“_Let us be about the Father’s business and assist him in his search for the lost sheep.”_ _…And in David’s words – Dear Willem & PIRTeam, I wish to extend my profound thanks to Jeanette, Joy, Susan, Maramis, Mark, Chris, and Myra for their dedication to this committee and our mission to bring as many individuals as possible to the teachings of Jesus. The testimonials we receive always serve to revive our sense of duty and accomplishment, driving us ever forward to saving the next soul, and the next. For this is the work we do my friends – in cooperation with the angels, midwayers and, no doubt, our collective Thought Adjusters. It is an honor to serve with you all. In good cheer – David Linthicum_

---

_On behalf of everyone who has ever served with you David, thank you. It has been an honor and a joy. On behalf of the active PIRT Team, we’ve gotcha brother. Thank you for trusting me as your successor. Your very large shoes will be a challenge to fill, and I will do my best with you always in my heart._ – Myra Hight

---

_A splendid light has left us – and now that light continues its journey to Paradise.  And though my heart is broken, the memories of David are precious and will be carried with each of us forever._ – Margaret Slater-Thompson

---

_David, you were only with us for a short time but you were a great presence to all. I know that you were ready and anxious to see all the beautiful lights of heaven. **Indeed, a mighty oak has fallen.**_ – Imogene Drake
