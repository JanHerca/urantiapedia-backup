## Italian Urantia Book Readers Meeting

**Saturday 29 August, 2015**

Bussolengo (Verona), Italy

Theme: _Discover The Urantia Book_

I am an Italian and French speaking Urantia Book reader, born in Switzerland with a French speaking father and an Italian speaking mother. I lived for many years in Italy teaching French. I discovered the French edition of _The Urantia Book_ in 2000 while I was fortunate enough to attend the study group led by Neal Waldrop. Fascinated by this surprising world of ideas, I wanted to share it with my friends in Italy and in Tessin (an Italian-speaking part of Switzerland.) I had to wait a few years before _Il Libro di Urantia_, the Italian edition of the book was published though.

In 2014 I met with the Italian translator of the book, Mr Memo Zago who is a very gracious and knowledgeable gentleman. With his encouragement and support, I began to organize a meeting of Urantia Book readers in Italy as we had not yet had an opportunity to meet each other or share our ideas on the book_._

The meeting will take place in Bussolengo, Italy, on 29 August, 2015, from 9.00am to 6.00pm at the Montresor Tower Hotel, several kilometers from the Verona airport and the Verona Porta Nuova railway station. Lunch will be provided and families are welcome.

We are pleased that readers from France will be attending as well as Urantia Foundation Trustee, George Michelson-Dupont and the Chair of Urantia Association International’s Conference Committee, Antonio Schefer. This meeting welcomes anyone who wishes to discover _The Urantia Book_ and to meet representatives of the organizations who work to produce and translate the book as well as to foster the study and spreading of its teachings.
