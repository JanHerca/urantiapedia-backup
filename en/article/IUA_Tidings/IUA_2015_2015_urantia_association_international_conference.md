Dear Friends and Readers of _The Urantia Book_,

Time is running out! Register now for Urantia Association’s International Conference in Quebec Canada.

This event is focused on spiritual education at many levels, starting in the family as a child and on to a mature adult. There is strong emphasis in _The Urantia Book_ regarding the importance of education; without learning there is no spiritual, social or intellectual progress in the individual and/or society. We all want to play a significant and meaningful part in our own evolution and of the world. This conference could help you do that.

Why should you attend this conference? Because international conferences are unique experiences that foster personal spiritual growth and brotherhood while tremendously enhancing your perception and appreciation of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. International conferences have been life-changing experiences for students, triggering insights into our deep potential – the present and profound meaning of God’s plan for us, and the eternal value we may claim in universe service.

The present is where we live and can act, the future is not open to our mind – this is why you should register now. Time is running out to have the best prices!

## Request for Conference Workshops Facilitators

For those of you who are coming or planning to come to this conference a detailed program is available for those who may be interested in facilitating a workshop. This can be downloaded as a PDF file by clicking [here (for English)](http://urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Program-final-Quebec-Conference-eng.pdf) or [here (for French)](http://urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Program-final-Quebec-Conference-fr.pdf).

To apply to be a workshop facilitator [click here (for English)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dFhU_7ODA1p0fwEnv2T9Ye1JH5qBIUApm0yG8GqPKcQ/viewform?embedded=true#start=embed) of [here (for French)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uQ6AFb7d8rp46bqPmk_JkRGFaTznl5Zan9P_APHDRaw/viewform?embedded=true)

The program includes the plenaries as well as the workshops and some instructions on what is expected from the facilitators. Workshops are 90 minutes long, plenaries 30 minutes; experienced presenters have already been selected for the plenaries.

Some workshops are already assigned but many more are still available in different languages such as English, French, and Spanish. In total there are 60 workshops that will be made available to conference participants, enough to satisfy everyone’s interest across many subjects. These workshops will be offered for two full days, 30 workshops each day, with 15 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon. Each workshop curriculum was designed to be relevant to the plenaries preceding them.

When you peruse the program to choose a workshop that you would like to facilitate, notice that some already have names assigned to them. Many of the plenary speakers are facilitating workshops keyed to their presentation, and this offers them an opportunity to practice their teaching skills while participants get the benefits of a personal experience with the presenter and other students.

If you would like to give a workshop that is not offered, it will be considered if it is relevant to the program, or reflects the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. You may submit your idea and each application will be reviewed to ensure that it reflects the goal of the conference.

Workshops are a great way to participate and grow during a conference; for those who facilitate them, they offer a rare opportunity to share, learn, and teach new ideas and concepts that can enhance spiritual living. So, be enthusiastic in your desire to share your concepts of the teachings and learn—choose a workshop of your liking, you will never regret or forget your experience!

Your choice is required by June 1, with the information required on page 6 of the program.  Please allow a few days to respond to your request. We will also provide you with an informative document on how to facilitate a workshop; we will do all we can to make your contribution a unique experience.

The conference plenaries and workshops will also offer insights on how to help children initiate their relationship with God the Father, and how we as adults, parents and grand-parents can help and be part of this progressive process.
