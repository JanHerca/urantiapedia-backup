Urantia Association of the Netherlands (UAISUN) invites you to attend the 10th International Conference of Urantia Association International in **Amsterdam, The Netherlands**.

Our conference theme is **‘Jesus as a Teacher’** and we are inviting students of _The Urantia Book_ from all over the world. The subtitle is ‘Are You Ready to Live His Teachings In the 21st Century?’ This question calls us to explore what we know about Jesus’ teachings, his personal religion, and his message to us today. The program will inspire us to be true followers of Jesus and his teachings, and become the leaders and teachers of the future.
