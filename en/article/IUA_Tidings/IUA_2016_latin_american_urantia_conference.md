The Bogotá Urantia Association invites you to the First Latin American Urantia Conference, on October 14, 15, 16 and 17th, 2016 in Bogotá, Colombia, at the Lancaster House.

The name and subject of the Conference will be _The Teacher and The Student_. This theme will be developed from questions such as: What does it mean to be a teacher in our community? What does it mean to be a teacher at the local level, to advanced students, to new readers, to those who never heard of the book and don’t care to hear about it? How can we talk about the teachings in the book without ever mentioning the book? How did Jesus teach each of the different audiences he encountered? What can we learn from the teaching methods of all the various ‘schools’ described in the book – Melchizedek schools, Edentia schools, Dalamatia, Salem, Urmia? How were teachers trained in previous revelations?

**14-17 October 2016**

[Lancaster House](http://www.lancasterhouse.com.co/), Bogotá, Colombia

**Latin American Leadership Scholarship**

For this conference we created a special Latin American Leadership Scholarship thanks to help of the Urantia Foundation, Urantia Book Fellowship and Urantia Association International. This means we give preference to those leaders in Latin America who need financial assistance to represent their country at this International Conference, current or future Latin American Presidents, Vice Presidents and leaders who will take home the acquired teachings, to multiply and apply them in their Associations, and in their communities.

If we are able to bring enough Latin American leaders to this conference we will organize a special meeting for them at the end of the event.
