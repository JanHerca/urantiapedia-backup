Join others in learning the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Young or old, new or advanced, we can all learn something new. Take the opportunity to share ideas and to learn from others in your ongoing quest for deeper meanings and values.

Presently, classes are being offered at **Urantia Book International School** and **Urantia University Institute**. See their courses below.

## Urantia Book International School

The Urantia Book International School (UBIS) is sponsored by the Urantia Foundation. The January trimester is now in session and all courses are full, but new courses will be offered in April. Enrollment opens on Monday, April 17. 

Courses are generally available in German, Polish, Hungarian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and English. Course content can vary by language. See the UBIS website for more information. [https://new.ubis.urantia.org/](https://new.ubis.urantia.org/)

### The Spotlight Series

**Exploring the Geology Papers** – **Is Your Foundation Rock Solid?**  
Instructor: Brad Garner  
DATE: Saturday, March 18. TIME: 11 am Central Daylight Time

ZOOM LINK: [https://urantia-org.zoom.us/j/88292383107](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001ZOBWy7XXwo8bNtO3AtkGjv-jXkn5nFHuF8KB7Ed6oJLhta2SgSTKxGRsdAIch3-qnT5MbFmTgaWc83Fgz5--wF9d8vHQciDx1OQkAc8OcRZF9D7q-KjaseenKt98sy6UmiF4f5di8tC6okezBERMZyfX8zn8H15RA82ikeLXgXg=&c=_k8LKWcL_V_kimrBkOVuGfflIFwtfapRmAdHZrR_DFFuYqLexNANsg==&ch=lE3teV1FW9yP3YYkAfS7CU38KgS1RhyjiOROKYb4-6DYm_mp1OEKMQ==)  
Please log in ten minutes before the scheduled time.

## Urantia University Institute

The Urantia University Institute (UUI) offers a wide range of courses in English. See the upcoming classes listed below.

**Life and Teachings of Jesus**  
Instructors: Geri Johnson and Rob Mastroianni  
Accepting rolling registration

The Life and Teachings of Jesus course is a weekly guided discussion consisting of a sequential reading of Part IV of The Urantia Book. While this course started on February 23 with Paper 120, **the course will accept registrations on a rolling basis due to the length of the course.** Each class will be offered two separate times on Thursdays to better accommodate our international audience.

**Fearlessly Foreword: A Brief Introduction**

Instructor: Merritt Horn  
Orientation Date: Monday, March 13  
Start Date: Monday, March 20

In this course, we’ll look closely at the purpose and structure of the Foreword, as well as its content. Understanding a piece of writing is about more than memorizing the words and dissecting the sentences the author uses, even if that writing is a dictionary; we also are well-served by examining the author’s purpose for the work as a whole as well as for the various elements that comprise it. So as we seek to better understand the Foreword, we’ll continually be asking not only what is on the page, but why it’s there.

**Self-Mastery and Circle Attainment**

Instructor: Michael Hill  
Orientation Date: Saturday, April 1  
Start Date: Saturday, April 15

 This course is designed to refresh and renew the spiritual aspirations of Urantia Book readers who have by faith, entered the kingdom of God and therein set for themselves the achievement of the fullness of mortal life. Here, we will strive to address the enhancement of personal spiritual perception and the influence of such growth on daily life while sharing our spiritual life with others and recognizing the religious life of others.

### Kids Urantia Lessons Survey

Urantia University is developing a program of live Zoom lessons where kids can interact with each other while a grown-up guides their light-hearted discussions about the life and teachings of Jesus and any other Urantia-based topics that come up in the course of conversation.

Learn more about it [here](https://mailchi.mp/urantiauniversity/kids-urantia-lessons) and, if this is something you might enroll your kids or grandkids in, please fill out our very short poll.
