_International Service Board_

We would like to acknowledge and thank our outgoing members of the International Service Board whose terms expired March 31<sup>st</sup> 2015. Their great work and dedication to Urantia Association International’s mission and goals over the last few years has helped us to keep moving forward in our work for the Urantia revelation.

**Merindi B** took office April 1, 2007 and served for two full four-year terms as Vice President. She also served as the Chair of the Association’s Representative Council during those same eight years. Merindi proved to be an outstanding Board member, not only doing her assigned duties with efficiency, diplomacy and grace, but also volunteering for several other responsibilities. She served on the project teams for the 2011 Leadership Symposium, the 2014 Study Group Symposium, and the 2015 International Conference. She was the team leader for the coordination of financial aid and visa applications for attendees of all three events. During her tenure Merindi went from being a single woman to becoming a wife, a mother of one, then a mother of two, while holding down a full-time job for much of that time. We are grateful for the wisdom and intelligence that Merindi brought to the Board and wish her well in her future endeavors.

**Vern Verass** took office April 1, 2007 and served for two full four-year terms as the Communications Chair. Vern is a professional graphic designer and was a powerhouse of creativity. During his tenure he led and directed the editorial boards of our three main publications: _Tidings,_ _Journal_ and the _Annual Report_ and redesigned their appearance and layout. He was at the forefront of the re-creation of the Association’s website and served on the subsequent revision team. Vern designed a new logo for the Association and developed a Logo Usage Policy as well as a Style Guide, which insures consistent visual branding across the entire Association. Vern was always eager to serve, create, and participate wherever and whenever he could. We will miss his bubbly personality and his positive outlook on life, but the good news is that he has agreed to be a member of the Communications Committee and will continue to use his expertise in the production of our publications.

**Bernie B** served for one four-year term from 2011 to 2015 and served as the Dissemination Chair. Bernie is a great ideas man and was responsible for coordinating many international efforts of outreach and dissemination of _The Urantia Book_. He provided information about _The Urantia Book_ and Urantia Association to the general public, responded to reader and non-reader inquiries, helped associations to get involved in book fairs, and assisted study groups in some of the developing countries to insure they had sufficient books for their members. Bernie is a devoted and dedicated student of _The Urantia Book_ and intends to continue to serve the revelation in whatever way he can. 

**Bill Beasley** took over from James Woodward as the Study Group Chair in October 2012 and dedicated much of his time as Urantia Association’s representative in the development of the Study Group Directory, which was a combined team effort of the three prominent Urantia organizations: Urantia Foundation, Urantia Association International, and the Urantia Book Fellowship. He also contributed to the planning and organization of the 2014 Study Group Symposium planning team. Bill’s experience and business background proved valuable to the board and his wise advice was always appreciated. Bill will never stop serving the revelation; we know he has a passion for study groups and will continue to foster them for as long as he possibly can.
