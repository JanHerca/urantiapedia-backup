## President’s Message – March 2023

_Enrique Traver, Brazil_

Dear Friends,

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/image-1.jpeg">
</figure>

More than ever, during these times of great world tension, I feel the urgency of our services to the Father and the brotherhood. By our services, I am not referring specifically to those of the Association’s legal entity, but to what it administers.

The fact that the Urantia Association International is a global organization can give people the impression that we are an institutional organization wanting to control their lives and dictate rules of behavior instead of being a welcoming center of harmony and unity, of help, support, and friendship.

I am a dedicated fan of the definition about who we are, as stated in the first paragraph of our website. See [About Us – Who We Are](https://urantia-association.org/about-uai/).

Urantia Association International is a worldwide network of ordinary people who have found an extraordinary book—_The Urantia Book_. Students believe that the teachings of this book have the potential to rejuvenate spirituality in the world and enhance the comfort, happiness, and well-being of every person.

The special Youth Urantiathon organized by the Urantia Association International with Urantia Young Adults International (UYAI) and Youth and Young Adults (YaYAs) Committees on December 10th, 2022, was beautiful and amazing. It offered presentations by young students of _The Urantia Book_ from all over the world on the theme “The Fruits of the Spirit.”

The program featured four sections, one for each continent, with presentations given by young Urantia Book students from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America, all of whom shared their unique reflections about _The Urantia Book_ and their personal experiences with the teachings.

The European section included two students, Genny from England, who offered a video about a Urantia study session titled **“From a seed, to a Fruit,”** and Moria Habte from the Netherlands, who presented an online interactive game with questions based on _The Urantia Book’_s teachings, with several options for the participants to choose the correct answer.

Faith is to religion what sails are to a ship; it is an addition of power, not an added burden of life. <a id="a135_104"></a>[[UB 159:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_8)]

The Urantia Association of the United States, in conjunction with co-host Hawaii Urantia Local Association would like to invite you to attend the 12th Urantia Association International 2024 Conference, to be held from the afternoon of March 28th, until noon on March 31 in Baltimore, MD, USA.

The Prisoner Inquiry Response Team (PIRT) would like to share this beautiful art, an example of the value in fostering the study of _The Urantia Book_ in prisons. The artist is Reinaldo Dennes and he is in a Texas prison. Reinaldo was introduced to _The Urantia Book_ eight years ago by a fellow reader doing in-person prison ministry. Reinaldo remains a dedicated student whose heart is filled with love for God and the teachings.

If you would like to use Reinaldo’s art in your Urantia works, please [Contact PIRT](mailto:prt@urantia-association.org)

## Focus on the Father

_James Woodward, USA_

### Living in Grace

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/James-Woodward-headshot-150x150.jpeg">
</figure>

There are several things about Jesus that we are often reminded of in _The Urantia Book_. Chief of these is how he revealed the Father in every aspect of his living. He did this by acting as if the Father were present in himself as well as the men and women he came into contact with all his life. This behavior reflects the living of a truth that we know as fact: we are indwelt with a (pre)personal representative of our Paradise Father. When a human behaves in a manner consistent with the faith / understanding of this truth / fact, a remarkable trait of character invariably assumes dominance in that personality. Such folks are said to be full of grace.

We hear the word grace a lot, but what does it mean? Consider some definitions: elegance or attractiveness of form, movement, manner, or attitude; mercy, favor, good will; God’s unmerited mercy toward mankind; influence of God’s spirit; condition of one who enjoys God’s special favor; trait of moral excellence. How about graceful: displaying beauty in form, manner, movement, or expression. And gracious: showing or bestowing goodness, kindness, or mercy. We find all the words synonymous with grace to be exclusively positive and harmonious; beautiful, favorable, kindly, benevolent, courteous.

### School of Divine Wisdom

This document is a compilation of the activities of the Progressive Divine Wisdom Group (PDWG) during 2022.

It is worth noting that the initiatives outlined in this progress report are a continuation of three meetings held as part of the Dakar summits of February 2018, February 2019 and February 2020. This report comes after the reports of 2020, 2021 and 2022, which have also been published.

The objective of these initiatives is to promote the Progressive Divine Wisdom method. This method, developed by Moussa Ndiaye, consists in facilitating the ownership of the truths of _The Urantia Book_ through a teaching method based on an understanding and living experience as part of education and sharing. It is based on the model of the life and teachings of the Creator Son of our Local Universe, during his incarnation in the flesh.

## Soul Evolution Study Aid

My latest study aid, _Soul Evolution: Deeper Delvings into Divinity_, is a more visual representation of concepts from _The Urantia Book_ which give us a clearer idea of what it takes to transform ourselves and attain self-mastery. How to co-create our souls together with our Thought Adjuster and become more Godlike. God has given us all we need to do this, but we have to develop the courage to explore these unknown realms. We need persistent effort to make this shift of consciousness. We must commit to letting go of old ways of behaving and thinking to see the world and other people in new ways. We are transferring our souls to new vehicles and gaining a cosmic perspective and an eternal purpose. It takes eternity to become perfect, but we can begin that divine process now. One of the main purposes of _The Urantia Book_ is the salvation of human souls.

## My Journeys with Jesus—Video

_Gary Tonge and Team_

_My Journeys with Jesus—The Urantia Book_ is a five-minute video cleverly arranged by Gary Tonge and a team of writers, artists, and producers. Here is how it is described under the video in YouTube:

A young man, Ganid, reflects upon his time with Jesus when they toured the Mediterranean together with his father, Gonod. The details of this magnificent story of Jesus’ travels can be found in _The Urantia Book_ and also in _The Untold Story of Jesus: A Modern Biography from The Urantia Book (2019)_. Discover Jesus as never before, both as a divine Son and a human hero whose matchless life inspires, comforts, and transforms you.

Enjoy this beautiful video.
