### 11<sup>th</sup> Urantia Association International Conference in the Land of the Incas

- Our Theme: _Towards Cosmic Citizenship… Your Time Has Come!_
- Our Location: Urubamba, Cusco-Peru
- The Date: April 22th-25th, 2021
- How to Register and More: [Click Here](https://urantia-association.org/2020/peru-2021-urantia-international-conference-and-registration/)
- Event Registration Link: [https://cvent.me/kMVko7](https://cvent.me/kMVko7)

> _Man … can elect to become more than a man;_ _can choose to embark upon the voyage of universe ascension, but this is because the human choice and the divine will happen to be coincident upon this point. And what a son desires and the Father wills will certainly come to pass._ <a id="a48_280"></a>[[UB 118:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p6_5)]

> _…Your short sojourn on Urantia, on this sphere of mortal infancy, is only a single link, the very first in the long chain that is to stretch across universes and through the eternal ages. It is not so much what you learn in this first life; it is the experience of living this life that is important. Even the_ work _of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important as the_ way _in which you do this work. There is no material reward for righteous living, but there is profound satisfaction—consciousness of achievement—and this transcends any conceivable material reward._ <a id="a50_594"></a>[[UB 39:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13)]

> _… And this entire living adaptation of love must be effected in the light of both the environment of present evil and the eternal goal of the perfection of divine destiny._ <a id="a52_176"></a>[[UB 180:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_10)]

What is the timeline in the evolutionary history of humanity? What are the traces left by the violet race that, today, we may freely utilize? How can we become conscious citizens of the universe? How can we turn ourselves into competent and reliable beings in the eyes of the universe? What is our commitment towards the Supreme Being—the evolutionary Deity? Can the age of light and life become a reality here and now? 

The purpose of this conference is to unite readers from each continent so that together, in brotherhood, we may become inspired to internalize and reach profound levels of spirituality as revealed in the fifth epochal revelation. The above quotes and questions regarding our ascending journey towards cosmic citizenship tell us that our transit route is to live each and every day as potential citizens of the universe. What an opportunity to be doing this for several days together in a part of the world in which the violet race legacy, the energy of the many visiting spiritual truth seekers, and the beauty of the natural Andean landscape, invites you to do so!

During the coming months, the program for this conference will be finalized and we will keep you updated through periodic postings via the website of Urantia Association International.

## Interesting Innovations

This next international conference will bring some interesting innovations. The event will offer not only plenary presentations in a conference room, but also activities in the beautiful and inspiring garden surroundings; we will provide dynamic and invigorating workshops in the midst of the breathtakingly vivid and outstanding historical and archaeological sites; and we will give you the opportunity to experience the exquisite Peruvian cuisine, which is renowned for being among the best culinary delights of the world. Thus, in addition to being spiritually nourished, you may also enjoy local hospitality and the experience of being in a place full of the mysticism of a culture thousands of years old. We hope that all this will take you beyond the normal expectations of a traditional conference.

## About the Conference Venue

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/OLLANTAYTAMBO-3-300x225.jpg">
</figure>

Peru, besides being a country of ancient history, is permeated with traces of an extraordinary culture, the origins of which are described in the pages of _The Urantia Book_. It is precisely in this context—in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Urubamba, Cusco—where this unique conference will be held.

The main plenary sessions will be held in the conference room of the five-star _Hotel Tambo del Inca_ and the afternoon workshops will take place in two archaeological sites, one being Ollantaytambo and the other yet to be determined.

The Sacred Valley is not only where a great deal of the archaeological remains of the Incas are located but is also the place from which trains depart to the citadel of Macchu-Pichu, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. 
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Altitude

When thinking of the highlands, some people worry about altitude sickness. The Sacred Valley is located at an altitude of 2,850 meters above sea level. Notice, however, that it is only 200 meters more than the altitude of the city of Bogotá, in Colombia, where some international and regional events of Urantia Association have already taken place. However, those few cases that may be affected by altitude sickness will be easily taken care of with rest and oxygen—a service that will be provided from arrival at the airport, during the journey to the Sacred Valley, and on-site.

## Conference Service Costs

## Additional Costs

### Entry to the Archaeological Sites

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/SITE-URUBAMBA-2-300x300.jpg">
</figure>

The price of the tourist ticket ranges between approximately USD$10 and USD$40. The ticket allows for entrance to various archaeological sites. The reason this cost is not included in the main conference costs is because it depends on the type of ticket each person requires, which can vary according to one’s status (e.g.: national, foreigner, or student) and the number of days and/or tourist attractions the ticket covers. (Some may choose to do a trip after the conference). To determine the exact costs of tourist tickets, check here: [Cusco touristic ticket](https://www.cuscoperu.com/en/useful-information/touristic-tickets/cusco-touristic-ticket)
