# Donate while Shopping with Amazon

From [Tidings - October 2015](https://urantia-association.org/pub/tidings-october-2015/), By Editor on November 14, 2015

## Shop with AmazonSmile and send a portion of your shopping dollars to Urantia Association International!

**What is AmazonSmile?**

AmazonSmile is a simple and automatic way for you to support Urantia Association International every time you shop, at no cost to you. When you shop at [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/), you’ll find the exact same prices, vast selection and convenient shopping experience as Amazon.com, with the added bonus that Amazon will donate a portion of the purchase price to the Association.

**How do I shop at AmazonSmile?**

To shop at AmazonSmile simply go to [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/) from the web browser on your computer or mobile device. You may also want to add a bookmark to [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/) to make it even easier to return and start your shopping at AmazonSmile.

**Which products on AmazonSmile are eligible for charitable donations?**

Tens of millions of products on AmazonSmile are eligible for donations. You will see eligible products marked “Eligible for AmazonSmile donation” on their product detail pages. Recurring Subscribe-and-Save purchases and subscription renewals are not currently eligible.

**Can I use my existing Amazon.com account on AmazonSmile?**

Yes, you use the same account on Amazon.com and AmazonSmile. Your shopping cart, Wish List, wedding or baby registry, and other account settings are also the same.

**How do I select the Association to support when shopping on AmazonSmile?**

On your first visit to AmazonSmile ([smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/)), you need to select Urantia Association International to receive donations from eligible purchases before you begin shopping. AmazonSmile will remember your selection, and then every eligible purchase you make at [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/) will result in a donation.

**How much of my purchase does Amazon donate?**

The AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price from your eligible AmazonSmile purchases. The purchase price is the amount paid for the item minus any rebates and excluding shipping & handling, gift-wrapping fees, taxes, or service charges. From time to time, we may offer special, limited time promotions that increase the donation amount on one or more products or services or provide for additional donations to charitable organizations. Special terms and restrictions may apply. Please see the relevant promotion for complete details.

**Can I receive a tax deduction for amounts donated from my purchases on AmazonSmile?**

Donations are made by the AmazonSmile Foundation and are not tax deductible by you.  Thank you for joining us in our efforts to spread light and life throughout Urantia.
