14 to 17 October, 2016

The First Latin American Urantia Conference was held in Bogotá, Colombia October 14-17, 2016 and was organized by the Bogotá Urantia Association (Asociación Urantia Bogotá, AUB.) The Conference included the participation of 16 countries, 108 attendees (46 from countries outside Colombia) and between 20 and 50 virtual participants throughout the conference who tuned into video transmission in Spanish via Zoom and English via Ustream.tv. Participants enjoyed learning from the information and experiences that were shared by 17 speakers who provided outstanding remarks and presentations.

The Conference opened on Friday with a welcome from the President of Urantia Association International, Chris Wood, followed by remarks from the President of the Urantia Colombia Association, Wilson Leon. Then the participants and delegations from each country were introduced.

That evening, attendees enjoyed a dinner and a live performance of instrumental music, during which everyone had the opportunity to get to know each other.

On Saturday there were seven talks and one workshop, which explored the teachings of the Master and the application of these teachings in our modern day era. On Saturday night we enjoyed a presentation by dancers who entertained us with a variety of rhythms and dances of Colombia; this was followed by a few hours of lively dancing by the participants.

On Sunday there were five talks in the morning and after lunch we visited the Cathedral of Salt of Zipaquirá, outside Bogotá. This beautiful cathedral, which is an underground Roman Catholic Church built within the tunnels of a salt mine, is regarded by many as the first wonder of Colombia.

On Monday the conference concluded with four talks followed by a general summary discussion. Many participants stayed for lunch afterwards to share more perspectives and ideas.

During the conference Latin American leaders met to discuss a Strategic Plan for Latin America for the next four years. In addition, three candidates were nominated for the role of Continental Coordinator for Latin America. These candidates will each submit a resume and strategic plan to the members of the International Service Board (ISB) of the Association for selection of a suitable candidate. We hope this initiative will create new momentum and will serve as a pathway for the propagation of the Fifth Revelation throughout Latin America.

We would like to thank all of the participants of the first Latin American Urantia Conference for answering the call of the AUB. These participants followed their hearts to decide on being a part of this event so that they may keep learning more from the teachings of the Master when he was here on earth about how to become Masters and Students. (Maestros y Discipulos.)

We also want to thank Urantia Association International, Urantia Foundation and The Urantia Book Fellowship for the financial support that subsidized the attendance of many readers from all over Latin America; we also had a lot of help and support in many other ways from the ISB. We are also grateful for the donations made by certain Colombian people which facilitated the attendance of several readers of our country. Also thank you to the volunteers who assisted, including Serapis Murillo, Elizabeth Prieto, Carlos Rincón, Italia Del Castillo, Liliana Vargas, Edwin Fernando Isaza, Lina Critancho and Laura Cristancho who helped make this an amazing event which was one of inspiring and uplifting contemplation full of high level emotion in a fraternal and spiritual atmosphere.

Again, thank you to all those who participated and collaborated in so many ways to make this event so inspiring and successful.
