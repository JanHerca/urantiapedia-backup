It is with great pleasure that we announce the European Urantia Conference, to be held in Budapest, Hungary, 15 to 18 September 2016.

The Blue Club (European Urantia Book Readers) has been working hard to create this event in Eastern Europe. To unite the east with the west we chose this historical city for our next International Conference. Our last meeting was in Berlin 2014. Fifty-five Urantia Book readers participated in that event. The aim of this conference is to discuss questions about Jesus with the theme: _Who is Jesus?_ Urantia Book readers from all around the world are welcome to join our Continental Conference.

Novotel Budapest Centrum hotel offers direct booking using a unique booking URL. This way you will have a room at the hotel during the event. You can book your room by clicking [here](http://www.accorhotels.com/accorhotels/lien_externe.svlt?goto=resa_express&code_hotel=3560&code_chaine=ACC&code_avantage=URANT&sourceid=&merchantid=ADV-AccorHU) Because of high season activities in Budapest during our event, and to keep the financial risk low for the event organizers, we only have an option with the hotel for 90 people. On 15 June the hotel will cancel 40% of the non sold block if we cannot guarantee these rooms to them. After that date the hotel can rent the rooms to any other paying guest, even if they are not taking part in our conference.

**EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP SCHOLARSHIP**

For this conference we created a special European Leadership Scholarship. This means we give preference to those leaders in Europe who need financial assistance to represent their country at this International Conference. Current or future European Presidents, Vice Presidents and leaders will benefit from participating in this event and take the teachings back to their Associations. If we are able to bring enough European leaders to this conference we will organize a special meeting for them at the end of the event. For more information about the European Leadership Scholarship contact Antonio Schefer at [conference@triniteit.org](mailto:conference@triniteit.org)

Note: European Leadership Scholarships are not available anymore!
