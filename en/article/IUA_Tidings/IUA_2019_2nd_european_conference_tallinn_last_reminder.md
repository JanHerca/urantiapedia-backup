A reminder that the time for the 2nd European Urantia Conference that’s being held in Tallinn, Estonia, **11 – 14 July 2019** is almost upon us.

The theme of the conference is: **“Sowing** **S****eeds– Qualitative Internal and Quantitative External Growth”** and the focus will be on how we can grow internally in spirit and externally in numbers. Students of _The Urantia Book_ from all over the world are welcome.

The program will concentrate on spiritual growth potentials and on growing the numbers of readers. A variety of readers from different countries in Europe and other continents will present their experiences, examining what they have done to find new readers and to form new study groups.

The Estonian Urantia Association (Eesti Urantia Assotsiatsioon – EUA) will be hosting this conference, which will take place at the Tallink Spa & Conference Hotel in Tallinn, Estonia. The main language spoken during the conference will be English, but If your native language is not English and it is difficult for you to understand it, you should know that we plan to translate all presentations into several different languages (depending on how many volunteer translators we find) and have them available at the beginning of the conference as printed text.

The conference website can be found at: [www.urantia.ee/conference2019](http://www.urantia.ee/conference2019/) and will give you detailed information about the program, registration for the event and reservation of your hotel room.
