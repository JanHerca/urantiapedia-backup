## Unity in Purpose & Action

Instead of our normal March quarterly issue of _Tidings_, this special issue is dedicated to reporting on a sample of the work being done by some of our loyal and dedicated members serving the revelation at the grass roots level of Urantia Association International.

All our members join the Association by becoming members of one of the National or Local Associations that are scattered around the globe. If there are none of these associations in a region where a member resides, they may join as a Member-At-Large. This way we are unified not only in spirit but also in action.

The structure of Urantia Association is specially designed for the inclusion of a diversity of languages, cultures, and nationalities while remaining true to our mission which is to “foster the study of _The Urantia Book_ and to disseminate its teachings.”

Enjoy these reports from some of our associations to get an idea of how the teachings of the Urantia revelation are taking root all over the world.

## Brazil Urantia Association

_UAB Board, Brazil_

</figure>

The Urantia Association of Brazil (UAB) was established as a National Association of Urantia Association International in 2003. It is one of the largest associations with a total of 493 members, 120 of whom have read the book in its entirety. All the activities of our association during the 2020/2021 biennium was guided by a strategic plan that was established at the beginning of 2020 to provide direction and structure for our association.​ In this way, we established and implemented well-defined objectives and followed up with weekly meetings of the board to assess the progress of activities.​

In general, our overarching goal is to become more proactive in our work of spreading the Urantia revelation in Brazil and ​to become better acquainted with Urantia Book students of in our region. We want to become more efficient in distributing _The Urantia Book_ and to provide effective communication channels so that students of the book can find one another for study and socializing purposes.

Senegal was chartered as a National Association of Urantia Association International in 2001 under the name of "Senegalese Association of Research and Studies." During the course of 2021, we carried out activities in relation to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in the form of the "Progressive Divine Wisdom Group" (PDWG).

Our approach consists in establishing a progressive program of personal assimilation of the concepts of _The Urantia Book_. This program is structured in the form of instruction by sharing experiences and spiritual activities through a Progressive Divine Wisdom education. It is intended for readers of _The Urantia Book_ and for all seekers of Truth and God, whatever their journey.

## Australia & New Zealand Urantia Association

The Australia & New Zealand Urantia Association (ANZURA) was first chartered as a National Association in 1994 and was one of the pioneer non-American associations to join the then new Urantia Association International that has always supported and worked closely with Urantia Foundation. (Many of ANZURA's founding members had been members-at-large of the former Urantia Brotherhood.)  

**Study Groups**
Since the Covid pandemic stimulated the explosion of Zoom internet conferencing technology, many readers who were previously unable to experience a study group now have the opportunity to reap the benefits of studying and socialising with fellow readers. Needless to say, study group attendance has grown rapidly in the last couple of years.

## Guatemala Urantia Association

</figure>

Guatemala Urantia Association was chartered as a Local Association of Urantia Association International in 2021. The years 2020 and 2021 were atypical years for the Guatemala Urantia Association. During the first four months, the entire population was subject to mandatory confinement in their homes. We could only leave our homes for those services essential to life and food supply. Consequently, work was done at home, and part-time jobs, which are commercial activities for most of the population, reported heavy losses. As an economic fact, experts in the sector consider that part-time jobs account for seventy percent of Guatemala's economic activities, so there was an increase in unemployment. It is important to mention this because the main efforts of Guatemalans have been oriented towards the survival of their families and the fulfillment of their individual obligations. 

For the activities of dissemination and teaching, there has been goodwill on the part of the Guatemala members who sent out ten Urantia books by private mail and invited people to join study activities using social media and Zoom software. The activity of sharing the teachings via social networks has not diminished in intensity and it helps to bring readers together in Guatemala.

## GLMUA – New Membership Invitation

</figure>

Greater Lake Michigan Urantia Association (GLMUA) is a Local Association of the United States Urantia Association (UAUS). Recently we hosted a New Membership Invitation Meeting and as a result, we are now welcoming two new people into our ranks. For organizations like the many Urantia associations around the world that make participation in events open to all, it is difficult to express the benefits of membership. This meeting gave GLMUA an opportunity to pointedly convey who we are, what our goals are, and how it serves the individual and the community when people become members.

This meeting has been a long-time coming. As president, I’ve had it on my mind for a couple of years but wanted to build up to it with a record of maintaining our regular activities (planning various gatherings throughout the year) while also taking on some unique activities which grab people’s attention and get them excited. GLMUA members worked together to give a talk at a Urantiathon and a group was formed to support people in reaching their personal goals. This build-up paid off, as one of the new members stated that the reason why he was joining, even though he is a self-professed non-joiner, is because of how active we have been.

## Belgium-Francophone Urantia Association

</figure>

The Belgium-Francophone Urantia Association (ABFU) was charted as a Local Association of Urantia Association International in 2006. For 40 years, study groups were initiated mainly by one man: François Dupont. As of 2006, the groups were gradually overseen by the new President, Jean Annet.

We organize study groups in different cities, participate in expos and fairs, and give lectures in both public and private places so that hundreds of people may hear about _The Urantia Book_ in French-speaking Belgium.

</figure>

The Sweden Urantia Association was chartered as a Local Association of Urantia Association in 2007. The study group in Stockholm started around 2005. Over that time, group members have been changing as some have left the group and new ones have been coming in. Today there are five of us from Sweden and two from Finland.

Normally we have meetings at someone’s home, twice a month. During the pandemic, the meetings have been once a month on the Internet, and still are. 

We donated the Finnish translation of _The Urantia Book_ to the Finnish library in Stockholm about ten years ago. The book was stolen so we donated another one. Now we are planning to donate books to the Swedish libraries.

### Service to the Urantia Community

Urantia Association International's Education Committee is honored to serve the Urantia Community by organizing webinars and workshops in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, with the purpose of providing opportunities for study and reflection, as well as cultivating friendships among members of our community around the world.

When the pandemic began, our online activities intensified, offering more opportunities to come together to share learning moments and help each other to get through these difficult times.

The service of the presenters in studying and sharing their sincere understandings of the revelation, has tremendous didactic and spiritual value. The efforts to acquire knowledge and teach by sharing one's discernment fulfills the universal method of learning and imparting the teaching to others, a method also used in the school of evangelists in Bethsaida as organized by Jesus.
