## Inspirations of the Urantia Revelation—Beauty, Art, Music, and Expressions of the Soul

Urantia Association International produced yet another successful 24-hour Urantiathon held over the weekend of 7<sup>th</sup> August 2021. This time we tried something different where we joined with artists from all over the world who shared their creative works inspired by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Each artist presented uniquely different creations, so the entire weekend was truly filled with “Expressions from the Soul.” Thank you to each and every one of you who shared your wonderful talents.

The conference was held via Zoom and live-streamed to the Association’s Facebook page. Over 850 people from all continents tuned in from the comfort of their homes to experience the diversity of creative talents. Presenters hailed from many different countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and other countries in Latin America.

Simultaneous translations for English, Spanish, and Portuguese were provided during certain segments. Thank you once again to those amazing translators who again served tirelessly for hours at a time to make it possible for more people to experience the diversity of presentations. Also thank you to those who volunteered to host the various segments to ensure there was always someone fresh and able to keep this around-the-clock event on track. And of course, a big thank you to all of those loyal and industrious volunteers who worked so hard in the preceding weeks and months to make this event happen.

If you were unable to attend, missed anything, or simply wish to revisit a presentation, you can view the recordings in the video section of our Facebook page at: [https://www.facebook.com/urantia.association/videos/](https://www.facebook.com/urantia.association/videos/)
