## President’s February 2015 Message

_Chris Wood_

Fellow students of _The Urantia Book_, I want to give you exciting updates on four of the many ongoing projects the Urantia Association International is juggling.

In December we called for donations to help send a shipment of books to Zambia and Malawi, two countries with growing reader communities in southern Africa. Thanks to many generous donors and our dedicated “Seed” funding, 200 copies of _The Urantia Book_ set sail across the Atlantic. The ones to Malawi have already arrived safely.

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">

There are eight study groups in Malawi, with 60 people who have finished their first reading of _The Urantia Book_, and there are many more who are eagerly reading. This shipment of books will allow for students to have their own copies as well as copies of the book to be placed in universities, hospitals, and libraries throughout the country. As many of you would know, Malawi has recently suffered from devastating floods, with half of the country being declared an emergency disaster zone. Grevet Moyo, who serves as Association President in Malawi, and Rick Lyon, former Executive Director of Urantia Association International, have teamed up to sell Malawi art in the United States to help one village. (Anyone wishing to purchase some of these paintings can contact the Central Office or Rick at [ricklyon@tctc.com](mailto:ricklyon@tctc.com).)

Dear Friends and Readers of _The Urantia Book_,

Time is running out! Register now for Urantia Association’s International Conference in Quebec Canada.

This event is focused on spiritual education at many levels, starting in the family as a child and on to a mature adult. There is strong emphasis in _The Urantia Book_ regarding the importance of education; without learning there is no spiritual, social or intellectual progress in the individual and/or society. We all want to play a significant and meaningful part in our own evolution and of the world. This conference could help you do that.

Why should you attend this conference? Because international conferences are unique experiences that foster personal spiritual growth and brotherhood while tremendously enhancing your perception and appreciation of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. International conferences have been life-changing experiences for students, triggering insights into our deep potential – the present and profound meaning of God’s plan for us, and the eternal value we may claim in universe service.

The present is where we live and can act, the future is not open to our mind – this is why you should register now. Time is running out to have the best prices!

## 2015 International Conference Program Schedule

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/UAI-2015-logo_13a-300x309.jpeg">
</figure>

Following are the plenaries for you to appreciate. Also see further on for the Program Schedule. Workshops will be published soon for readers to volunteer as facilitators.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

### Day One

**1\. The Child and His Education (_Lourdes Burga-Cisneros_)**

_The Urantia Book_ teaches us that the universe is a great school where we are both student and teacher. The education of children is basic in the outlining of the character on which the Adjuster will lean on to do his work within the mind, where the great responsibility of parents is involved. This plenary is a reflection on the importance of creating an environment conducive to the growth of the child.

## Spreading The Urantia Book in Ukraine

_Anton Miroshnichenko_

I conducted a study on the possibility of spreading _The Urantia Book_ through the book trading network in Ukraine. Based on my research, I can describe the following possible book distribution channels in Ukraine.

**Individual sales over the Internet**

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/Ukrainian-UB-150x150.jpg">
</figure>

We posted an announcement with a proposition to buy _The Urantia Book_ at the Urantia Association of Ukraine Website, [http://www.urantia.org.ua/p/2013.html](http://www.urantia.org.ua/p/2013.html), as well as on all possible free resources on the Internet (Websites ads, catalogs). Readers could order by phone or by email. A buyer could pay for the book on delivery. Shipping was done through commercial delivery service, “Nova Poshta” (New Mail). This delivery method was very convenient because in Ukraine there is a network of delivery offices. Buyers need to come to the nearest office in his/her city and pick up his purchase. The average delivery period in Ukraine is 1-2 days, and postage for one book costs about $2 to any city in Ukraine.

**Personal recommendations**

Usually those who buy the book recommend it to friends. After that, friends began to place their own orders. Most of the books were sold by these two methods.

## Virtual Study Group – Symmetry of Soul

_James Woodward_

### Symmetry of Soul Progresses into its Fifth Year

Virtual study groups of _The Urantia Book_ are growing in popularity and provide a valuable option for those without a local meeting of readers.

One of the first virtual study groups of _The Urantia Book_ to take wing on the Internet, Symmetry of Soul (SoS) has featured in-depth broadcasts since September 1, 2010. Originally launched with three co-hosts, Ann Garner, Dr. Chris Halvorson, and James Woodward, the program soon recruited one of its early supporters, Kermit Anderson. Each of the four co-hosts brings their unique personality and perspective to the weekly sessions, but Dr. Halvorson, who has led a well-attended study group in Boulder, Colorado, for the last 20 years, skillfully directs the systematic “unpacking” of the revelation.

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/Symetry-of-Soul-150x150.jpg">
</figure>

The Symmetry of Soul program is broadcast live for two hours every Tuesday at 9:00 pm ET (6:00 pm PT) by BlogTalkRadio, a very popular Internet company that allows anyone, from famous media stars to everyday folks, to create their own modern-day version of a radio show. To listen to and/or join in the study, go to [www.symmetryofsoul.org](http://www.symmetryofsoul.org/) or [www.blogtalkradio.com/symmetryofsoul](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/symmetryofsoul).

## Virtual Inspirational Messages

_Inspirational Messages of Light_ is led by Dr James Perry and a small group of truth seekers who desire to share their spiritual experiences with others. Their mission is to elevate the consciousness of the love of the heavenly Father through his son, Jesus, in those who already know the Father and in those who lack a relationship with him.

Their goal is to reach a large group of truth seekers. Tune in to hear the live radio broadcasts of current 282 inspirational messages at [http://www.warr.1520.com](http://www.warr.1520.com/) every Saturday morning from 9:45 am until 10:00 am.

Hear live inspirational messages (or read them) on such topics as Faith Consciousness (Message 200); The Truth of the Father’s Love (Message 144); Living the Spirit-Filled Life (Message 31); and The Discipline of Submitting to the Father’s Will (Message 127).

## Farewell to Shirley Pelland

_Susan Owen_

</figure>

Shirley Pelland graduated from her life on Urantia Friday February 21, 2015. Shirley is a long time and devoted student of _The Urantia Book_ and beloved member of the Urantia community. Her wonderful vibrancy, energy, love and caring touched so many.

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/Shirley-Pelland-150x150.jpg">
</figure>

Shirley was a member of the First Urantia Society of Los Angeles and a charter member of the Southwest Urantia Reader Family (SURF) where she served as an officer for many years while living in Southern California. She also served as the first Secretary of the International Service Board of the International Urantia Association from 2003 – 2007. She later moved to Ocean View on the ‘big’ island of Hawaii to be closer to her family and there she served for many years as an officer of Hawaii Urantia Local Association (HULA).
