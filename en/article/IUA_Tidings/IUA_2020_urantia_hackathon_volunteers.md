**In the middle of this pandemic, have you perhaps stopped to wonder: “What will the future look like after all this has passed?”** 

We have as well, and would like to invite you to join us in crafting together some practical solutions to help us face the upcoming post-Covid-19 challenges with a steadier mind and a blossoming heart. Of course, with the guidance and inspiration in the beauty, goodness, and truth of _The Urantia Book_.   

We all know Urantia is in an acute crisis due to the current coronavirus pandemic. As in every crisis, this one will offer opportunities for personal progress and spiritual growth. We believe that one such unique opportunity will be to seed the teachings and insights from the revelation in the minds and hearts of members of our global communities in practical, utilitarian ways. We will focus on spirit-led active service.  

In a few weeks, we will be bringing together an extraordinary group of Urantia Book enthusiasts from our communities all over the world. The goal is to **ideate and co-create solutions** to challenges in key areas affected by the pandemic. 

The areas to be explored are: 

- Art, culture, and leisure 
- Civic life, social harmony, and solidarity 
- Economy, business, and work 
- Education and extra-curricular development 
- Health, well-being, and medical care 
- Home, family, and community 

We would love you to be part of this! 

We are currently inviting volunteers to join one of our teams and collaborate in a very dynamic and creative platform: a _Urantia Hackathon_. 

If the term hacking may sound negative to you, let us explain what this is all about. 

The concept of a Hackathon was actually coined in the software industry and is now spreading to other domains—healthcare, social, political, etc. 

The word Hackathon is a blend of _hacking_ (the act of [finding a clever and counterintuitive solution to a problem](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/hacking-any-different-from-creative-solution.html)) and _marathon,_ because co-creation sessions normally run non-stop for up to 72 hours!  

However, ours will be a _mini-Hackathon_ with a duration of only 8 hours. 

## What will happen during the 8-hour Urantia Hackathon? 

The event will include plenary sessions and hacking sessions, followed by a voting session. 

As a team member, you will be guided by a Team Leader and a Mentor. Your team will be given a specific challenge (a problem) in one of the above areas. 

You will then engage in a structured and creative process of ideation, blending and prototyping, finalizing in a validation process for your chosen solution (“hack”).

## An Invitation to Participate 

Would you like to be to be part of this? 

Worried? Haven’t heard of a hackathon? Haven’t participated in one? 

**Anyone** can participate in a hackathon! You will be coached and guided throughout the process by the ideation team, the Mentors and your Team Leader. 

We are welcoming participants of all ages and walks of life to join one of our international Hacking Teams_._ So far, we have six teams accepting volunteers in four regions (Europe, North America, Latin America and West Africa), and functioning in five languages (Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish).  

If you find yourself excited to find out more and see yourself as a Hacking Team member, please send us a WhatsApp (+41 79 949 3064 or +972 54 459 2514) or  an email to [urantia.hackathon@gmail.com](mailto:urantia.hackathon@gmail.com). We promise to get back to you promptly!  

Additionally, we will be offering “Intro and Q&A” Zoom sessions in the next few weeks. So, please send us a Whatsapp or email and we will send you an invite. 

We look forward to hearing from you! 

In loving service,   
The Urantia Hackathon 2020 Ideation Team:   
Sandra and Gabriel Rymberg, Samantha Nior, Lourdes Burga-Cisneros, and Luis Garcia-Bory
