This year the ANZURA conference returns to the nation’s capital, this time in a bush setting on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee River. The conference will be hosted by the very capable “Canberra Crew” and our keynote speaker will be astrophysicist and long-time reader, Nigel Nunn.

## Theme: Mind Over Matter—Spirit Over Mind

> _In the evolutionary superuniverses energy-matter is dominant except in personality, where spirit through the mediation of mind is struggling for the mastery. The goal of the evolutionary universes is the subjugation of energy-matter by mind, the co-ordination of mind with spirit, and all of this by virtue of the creative and unifying presence of personality._ <a id="a46_365"></a>[[UB 116:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p6_1)]

It is pretty obvious that in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century there is considerable understanding of the ways in which the human mind has been subjugating matter. The industrial and technological advances of the previous couple of centuries have resulted in modern men becoming virtual worshipers of science, and many suggest that this will lead eventually to mankind’s complete understanding of the material world.

However, we need to remember that the Supreme requires that matter be subjected to **spirit**, and that mind is only the means to this end. This leaves science with the job only partially done, and unless that mind with which matter has been partially subdued is itself directed by spirit, with the motivation of personality, then nothing like complete understanding is possible.

Our object in this conference is to highlight this distinction.

**Venue**

Green Hills Conference Centre, Stromlo, Canberra, ACT 2611.

Greenhills Centre is only fifteen minutes from Parliament House, yet there by the Murrumbidgee River you will feel far from the hustle and bustle of politics, out in the country, relaxed in a beautiful bush setting with views over the Brindabella Ranges. The ideal setting for delving into _Mind Over Matter – Spirit Over Mind_.

It is also just a short distance from the Cotter Dam recreation reserve and Mt Stromlo Observatory.

**Cost**

Full conference $300 — includes 3 nights of twin-share accommodation with ensuite bathroom, bed linen and all meals from Friday night dinner to Monday breakfast. (If you do not wish to share a room please indicate on the registration form. Additional charges will apply.)

Daily Rate $70 — includes both lunch and dinner.
