**Thursday, July 21st — Sunday, July 24th**

**Machiventa Melchizedek — Preserving Truth and Lighting the Way for Future Revelations**

Oak Brook Hills Resort and Conference Center 3500 Midwest Rd, Oak Brook, Illinois (near Chicago)

The Urantia Book Fellowship’s Education Committee is pleased to announce the upcoming Summer Study Session (SSS) 2022 to be held at the beautiful Oak Brook Hills Resort and Conference Center. At long last, we will be gathering with our Urantia family in-person again to learn about “one of the most unique of all characters ever to become connected with the history of Urantia.” \[Paper 93:10.11, page 1026.1\]

It was 4,000 years ago that Machiventa Melchizedek heroically “personalized” on earth; at a perilous time when revealed truth was on the brink of extinction.

Together we will:

- Examine the circumstances that led to his bestowal
- Study his teachings and how they set the stage for Michael’s bestowal
- Explore the lessons to be learned from the Melchizedek mission for modern-day truth revealers
- And much more…

## Call For Presenters and Volunteers

Are you interested in presenting your ideas and sharing your experiences with your fellows? The Education Committee is soliciting workshop presentations related to the theme of “Machiventa Melchizedek.” Please use this link to contact our Program Coordinator, Tim Duffy, to request a Workshop Proposal form.

Thank you!

## We Hope to See You There

Come study, worship, and fraternize with us as we reflect on many of the various features of the Third Epochal Revelation and celebrate the 4,000th anniversary of Machiventa Melchizedek’s bestowal on our planet!
