Margo Sherwood, beloved wife of Will Sherwood, after a long illness, graduated peacefully in the early hours of Saturday morning, October 29, 2022, with the help and support of her husband, her pets, and loving hospice care workers. 

Margo was born in 1954 in Hungary and escaped that communist nation in her early 20’s. She and her then husband stayed in Austria for nine months awaiting political asylum to become American citizens.

As a successful real estate agent in Los Angeles, CA, she spent her office breaks talking with (unknown to her at the time) Urantia Book reader, Jean Painter. And for about nine months, though they talked much about philosophy, surprisingly Jean never mentioned the book! However, while attending a Whole Life Expo in Pasadena, CA, Margo found herself drawn to the booth hosted by _The Urantia Book_ Los Angeles Society. As she read over a list of people currently reading the book, she was stunned to find that her friend and colleague, Jean, was on the list of people reading and studying the book! Margo immediately called Jean, saying, “This is Margo from Urantia! Why haven’t you told me about this book?” From that point, still in her 20’s, Margo started actively reading the book and attending study groups in Southern California.

While attending a party in Joshua Tree, California, her friends pointed out recently widowed Will Sherwood and his two boys, nine and eleven. Since her divorce eight years previously, Margo had made it her goal to marry a widower with children, and she immediately introduced herself to Will.

Sparks flew, and they spent the rest of the night gazing at the stars and talking about their eternal adventure. They were married in Hawaii two years later by long time reader, Marian Hughes.

In addition to continuously attending or hosting a study group since those days, Margo helped host the Foundation’s Trustees in their home in Santa Clarita, CA for the founding of SURF, the Southwest Urantia Readers Family. She was also one of the founders of  the Urantia Association of Los Angeles. (She had playfully suggested perhaps the association be called Santa Monica Urantia Readers Family, but the acronym “SMURF” was simply too funny for serious consideration.)

After 26 years of devoted marriage and travel around the world attending Urantia conferences, Margo and Will settled in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. All who knew Margo look forward to meeting up with her on the mansion worlds.
