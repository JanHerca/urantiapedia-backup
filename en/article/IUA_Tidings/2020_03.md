## President’s Message – March 2020

A Solitary Messenger tells us that:

_The doing of the_ **_will of God_** _is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God…_ <a id="a65_140"></a>[[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1) emphasis added]

In that spirit, I would like to share a little story about my life.

My time with the Association has run parallel with my time as a parent. I ask a lot of questions of parents who have raised children with _The Urantia Book_. I prioritize first and foremost that my boys do not grow up resenting the Urantia Community for taking away their father’s attention. For seven years, I have tried to apply many of Jesus’ approaches when it comes to these two responsibilities. In Paper 138, we are told that Jesus would “…interrupt a serious conference with his apostles to fraternize with an intruding child” <a id="a69_535"></a>[[UB 138:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_9)]. I try to make sure that the kids feel comfortable interrupting any video conference I am participating in. We are also told that, as a child, Jesus “…accumulated a vast body of knowledge; as a youth he sorted, classified, and correlated this information…” <a id="a69_838"></a>[[UB 127:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_14)]. And so, whenever the opportunity arises, my wife and I will try to fill my kids with knowledge, hoping that they will be able to organize this knowledge into a true philosophy of living as they age.

The Urantia Book Study Group Directory (UBSGD) recently surpassed the largest number of listings added in any single year since 2011. A total of 68 new groups were added in 2019. This is more than double the number of new groups added in 2018. The Study Group Directory continues to grow as readers from more than 55 countries have found the Directory and added their study group information. At the end of 2019, the Directory had a total of 463 study groups.


### Origins and Development

In 2010, at Urantia Foundation, the leadership of Urantia Association International and The Urantia Book Fellowship met formally for the first time to promote unity among our organizations. Following this event, the organization’s information technology developers held a meeting to encourage the sharing of information. During this meeting, Urantia Foundation suggested the need for a central online source for study group contact information; a place where students of _The Urantia Book_ could easily find study groups in their area, and for study groups to find new members to grow their ranks. It was suggested this should be a progressive joint project. The result was the creation of the Urantia Book Study Group Portal.  Today that portal is known as the Urantia Book Study Group Directory: [UrantiaStudyGroup.org](http://www.urantiastudygroup.org/).

**Lifting Together – United in Purpose – Serving God the Supreme**

University of the Fraser Valley, BC  Canada
**July 28 to August 1, 2020**

[Registration is now open – Urantia Global Experience](https://urantiaglobalexperience.com/)

The Urantia Association of Canada and The Urantia Book Fellowship have teamed up to host this gathering in the Vancouver Fraser Valley. They invite everyone to come together to serve the global community by making a personal contribution to civilization on Urantia.

The Urantia Global Experience is a gathering of minds dedicated to serving God the Supreme through the exploration of solutions for the progressive evolution of civilization. We believe the overall success of this experimental endeavor rests on our spirit unity – our common motive to express the will of God in our daily lives as well as in our social institutions.

All participants are expected to actively engage in discussion groups focused on a variety of topics drawn from _The Urantia Book_  (71:4 Progressive Civilization). From these discussions, we hope to derive common ideas, solutions, and purpose.

## Third National Conference in Mexico City

</figure>

On August 24th and 25th, 2019, the Urantia Association of Mexico organized its Third National Conference in Mexico City, which was attended by sixty-four readers of _The Urantia Book_ from various cities of Mexico and Uruguay.

This gathering with our Mexican siblings was a cheerful and fraternal occasion, where we met again with several old friends and got to know personally other virtual friends who have been frequent participants in the online conferences organized by Urantia Association International’s Education Committee and in the online meetings of the Latin American Study Group.

Conferences organized by the Urantia Association of Mexico are characterized by being dynamic and participative, as well as interesting, instructive, and free for all attendees. The Mexican Association holds bi-monthly conferences and workshops where the attendees are invited to study and present themes from _The Urantia Book_. This dynamism is reflected in National Conferences because the attendees participate actively during their ongoing presentations, showing discernment and interest in the shared teachings. It is fascinating to see so many faces eager to absorb the teachings; answering their insightful questions is often a challenge for the presenter.

In our retreats, women are invited to deeply explore how the Divine dances with you in your physical, social, and spiritual life, and how you can deepen this relationship and reach out to other women in sisterhood.

We are a team of four women inspired by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Coming from different walks of life, we bonded through a shared vision, and it became our mission to enhance the status of being a woman dedicated to spiritual growth, intellectual advancement, and moral progress. In stepping out of conventional models of leadership, we have adopted the fishbowl conversation to create a milieu of soul-sharing.

Over the last 7 years, we have conducted workshops during conferences and facilitated women retreats nationally and internationally—we were fortunate to be invited to work in Canada, the USA, Hungary, and the Netherlands.
