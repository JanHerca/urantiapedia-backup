## Introducing Urantia Association’s Language Learning & Multi-Linguist Project*

We are now in the Urantia Post-Bestowal Age. As regards our current age, _The Urantia Book_ states:

> _While Jesus has shown the way to the immediate attainment of spiritual brotherhood, the realization of social brotherhood on your world depends much on the achievement of the following personal transformations and planetary adjustments:_
> 
> _1\. Social fraternity. Multiplication of international and interracial social contacts and fraternal associations through travel, commerce, and competitive play. **Development of a common language and the multiplication of multilinguists. The racial and national interchange of students**, teachers, industrialists, and religious philosophers._
> 
> _2\. Intellectual cross-fertilization. **... There must occur an exchange of national and racial literature.** Each race must become familiar with the thought of all races; each nation must know the feelings of all nations. Ignorance breeds suspicion, and suspicion is incompatible with the essential attitude of sympathy and love._ <a id="a48_335"></a>[[UB 52:6.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_2) Emphasis added]

In a first effort to address these challenges, Urantia Association International is embarking on a new program to encourage and provide support in learning a new language, and to increase the number of multi-linguists within our community. This program will begin by finding a volunteer(s) who speaks English and Spanish to coordinate the first group of 12 Spanish-speaking students who wish to learn or improve their English.

The students will begin by working with one of the online language learning platforms. They will work together as a team to complete weekly assignments. There will be regular Zoom meetings to get to know each other and to practice speaking and listening skills. After a student obtains sufficient language skills, the goal is to find placement for each student in a home in another country for one to three months, where the students will have a language immersion experience in a new culture.

But this program cannot begin until we find volunteers to coordinate the program. Please think about this amazing service opportunity to help Michael and our unseen friends take a tiny step towards social brotherhood on our planet. And, if you are interested in helping coordinate the learning of other languages besides Spanish and English, please do not hesitate to let us know.

To volunteer, you can either:

- Fill out the application on the Association website at: [https://urantia-association.org/get-involved/volunteer/](https://urantia-association.org/get-involved/volunteer/)
- Or call Central Office in the USA at: 1-773-572-1180

Thank you for considering this exciting service opportunity.
