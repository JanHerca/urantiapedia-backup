_By Patije Mills, Sarasota, Florida_

A few months ago, Connie Lester (Englewood, Florida) tickled my imagination by mentioning a possibility of “de-coding” the meaning of “Orvonton”. Since then I've had many such possibilities “pop into” my intrigued imagination. We have lots of fun speculating and I want to share the following information to see if any of you might have also uncovered these possibilities.

Is there a rhythm or pattern in words introduced to us by the Revelators? Is it possible that we are being introduced to the Universe, or System Language by the means of _The URANTIA Book_?

First it was suggested that many, if not most, of the nouns are pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. For instance:

Or-von’-ton, U-ran’-tia, Mon-ma’tia, U-ver’-sa, Norlat’-ia-dek, Sol-ar’-ing-ton, Fin-al’-it-ers, E-den’-tia, Havon’-a, Sa-tan’-ia.

Is it just a coincidence, or is there another level to this teaching when certain syllables are used as follows:

Orvonton = our Super Universe — note: _the URANTIA Book_ indicates that the supreme will reside on Uversa, so Orvonton will be (is?) the Superuniverse home of the Supreme.
- Or = of the Supreme?
- On = (in the middle of a word) = of the Son?
- On = (at the end of a word) = of the Father?
- Onton = of the Father and the Son with the Spirit?
- Orvonton = The Supreme Universe of the Father, Son and Spirit.

Monota = The living, non-spirit energy of Paradise; energy system of the Universal Father (471).
- Mo = System, or philosophy?
- On = Of the Son
- No = ???
- Ta= Living, non-spirit energy
- Monota = Living non-spiritual Energy System of the Son?

Mota = High levels of cosmic insight/more than a superior philosophy — it has a stereoscopic effect on meanings and values (<a id="a62_124"></a>[UB 48:7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7)).
- Mo = System, or philosophy?
- Ta= Living non-spirit Energy
- Mota = Living non-spiritual Energy Philosophy System?

Ultimata = smallest particle of living, non-spiritual energy, or materialised energy. 
- Ul = extreme?
- Ti = small?
- Ma = (matter?) purpose, State of Being
- Ta = Living, non-spiritual energy?
- Ultimata = Extremely small living energy materialised?

If ‘A’ or ‘TA’ is living, non-spiritual energy, could ‘Tia’ be a place of materialised energy? For instance:
- Urantia = our planet
- Ur = our chemistry name???
- An = Person, place or a state of being?
- Tia = Materialised energy?
- Urantia = This place of materialised energy, our planet?

Other examples: Edentia, Monmatia, Sandmatia, Assuntia, Veluntia, Salsatia, etc. A possible exception might be Morontia but perhaps not:

Morontia = State of being between pure material and pure spiritual? (But the other preceding syllables may change the meaning???)
- M or Mo= ?? System or philosophy
- Or = of the Supreme
- On = of the son (Ont = of the Son with)
- Tia = materialised energy?
- Morontia = a system of Materialised energy of the Son with the Supreme as ???

(or)

- Mo = System or Philosophy
- Or = of the Supreme
- On = of the Son
- Tia = Materialised energy
- Morontia = System of the Supreme energizing through the Creator Son?

Using this line of reasoning, ‘Dek’ then, would seem to be a type of power or authority. For instance: Norlatiadek, Melchizedek, Voronadek, Lanonadek, Chronoldeks... each a type of power or authority, specialised by the other preceding syllables, perhaps?

Likewise, ‘El’ seems to mean ‘special Son of the Father’ or ‘special Son of the Son’. For instance:
- Michael = Creator Son
- M = order of being?
- I = first?
- Ch = One who knows? (with a ‘Cha’ = Creator/ruler) (with ‘Chiz’ = Teacher/professor/leader)
- El = Son of the Father
- Michael = Creator Son of the Father/Ruler?

Other ‘El’ syllables include: Ang-el, Immanu-el, Gabri-el, Archang-el-s, Evan-gel-s, El-el-yon, M-elchizedek, and even Be-el-zabub!

Isn't this fascinating?

Please write to me if your imagination is also stimulated and/or you have discovered some of the codes!!!
