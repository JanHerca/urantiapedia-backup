In our religion the individual is of prime importance. Jesus was interested only in the individual person, and he allowed nothing to take precedence over that individual. This concern for the individual was a central feature of his entire earth ministry, and it still remains so. In fact, the entire universe organization appears to be established in such a way as to serve the individual.

I do not know of any human organization which has, in reality, placed the individual before all other considerations. Many claim to do this in theory, but they honor this claim only with their lips. Sooner or later the individual person recedes into the background while the organization becomes supreme. Time and again this has occurred, and it has inevitably led to the decay and destruction of those very organizations, while at the same time seriously hindering the progress of the individual.

### Jesus' Test

I believe that one of the great tasks we face is the construction of an organization whose sole purpose shall be the fostering of individual growth. As I understand it, this is the true intent behind the statements which comprise Article 2 of the Constitution of the URANTIA Brotherhood. In attempting to determine the specific activities which shall be undertaken, we should apply the same test which Jesus used: “_What does it do for the human soul? Does it bring God to man? Does it bring man to God?_” (<a id="a42_507"></a>[UB 126:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_5)) The true value of any institution is in the degree to which it devotes itself to these goals.

By fostering the growth of each, we foster the growth of all — the Brotherhood. The progress of the Brotherhood is bound up in the progress of each of its individual members, just as the Supreme depends upon the individual for His development.

The Brotherhood is quite possibly standing face-to-face with a challenge of destiny. It may be our task to actualize a new and living reality in human institutions — the truly person-centered organization. Such an institution could stand apart from all other institutions, while at the same time serving to inspire them through its living presence. Such an institution could also faithfully follow the command to serve men as Jesus did. What a magnificent challenge this is!

I do not see this as an easy task. The problems and difficulties to be encountered in such an undertaking would call for all the love and wisdom of which we are capable. Human experience has not yet successfully approached this problem. But whatever the difficulties, we do have perfect guides.
