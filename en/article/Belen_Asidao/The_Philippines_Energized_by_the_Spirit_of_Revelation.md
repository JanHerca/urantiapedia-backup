_By Belen Asidao, Illinois, United States_

_Editor’s Note: Eugene and Belen Asidao began their personal outreach program in their native country of the Philippines in 2014. Urantia Foundation has supported their efforts through the donation of hundreds of_ Urantia Book_s. Thanks to Eugene and Belen's generous and selfless service, the local readership has grown steadily, and the Filipino translation team continues to make steady progress._

It is with pleasure that I report on several exciting activities that have taken place this year.

The early months of 2023 found us in the less traveled roads of the southern Philippines to donate books from Urantia Foundation. Wider roads with four lanes are uncommon, but the streets of Davao City are quite impressive. Our spirited Urantia Book reader host was happy to meet us, as we had not seen one another for a long time.

With three other readers, we first went to a public library, where the librarian welcomed us. Next was the city hall, where one of their friends, a local official, happily accepted the donated copy of _The Urantia Book_. One of the bigger universities around the area, the University of Mindanao–Digos, also now enjoys some of the donated books.

All of the recipients asked questions and listened attentively to what we shared from this amazing book.

We are pleased to report that we have launched five study groups in different parts of the country and related activities for children. While kids have always accompanied the adults to their study group meetings, be it in person or via Zoom, suddenly they wanted their own study group! Their first activity was on April 9, Easter Sunday. They meet weekly to study _The Untold Story of Jesus_ to begin with. This book is drawn from Part IV of _The Urantia Book._ In time, their facilitator will introduce the papers from Parts I, II, and III.

Five groups of Urantia Book readers gathered on August 21 to celebrate the birthday of Jesus of Nazareth over two thousand years ago. Talks were given on how the tradition of Christmas on December 25 came about, and how the fifth epochal revelation exquisitely shows us how celestial beings prepared for the arrival of Christ Michael on Urantia. Celebrations included prayers before the communal meal, as well as children’s songs and dances. The combination of traditional Christmas decor with that of “the new Christmas” brought a soft shift in consciousness.

Our various Urantia Book study groups would love to share some pictures collected from Bicol (a region in the Philippines encompassing the southern part of Luzon Island and nearby island provinces), Palawan (an archipelagic province located in the region of Mimaropa, and the largest in terms of total area), Digos (the capital of the province of Davao del Sur), and Bacolod (the capital of the province of Negros Occidental).

Our service adventure continues this fall. Eugene and I recently returned to the Philippines to continue supporting study groups and the readership at large. And thanks to Urantia Foundation, 200 more Urantia Books just arrived for us to place in libraries.

Above all, Urantia Book readers in the Philippines are energized by the spirit of giving and sharing. A palpable sense of brotherhood and sisterhood under the fatherhood of God pervades the air!
