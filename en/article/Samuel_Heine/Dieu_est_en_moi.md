Not long ago, a Muslim friend said to me: Samuel, “the Koran is in you” and I replied: yes, God is in me and can become alive in each of us, we must bring to life the divine, unique and original qualities in each of us (Smile).

In the modern era of overconsumption and especially in relation to what “others” say or write about; personal development, self-realization of the true self, wisdom, well-being..., we often forget that this is already available in each of us in an unlimited, unique and original way.

Once man has truly consummated an intimate and close relationship with the living God, a book like Urantia's “Little and Ought” allows us individually to build into our beings in a logical and reasonable manner the grandeur of God's plan, it is this which enhances spiritual perception and expands cosmic consciousness as cosmic citizens.

This broadens and clarifies the framework of our thinking and automatically the framework of faith, of love in the natural spirit of cosmic brotherhood, that is visualizable, imaginable, coherent “and tangible” in the wonder and joyful gratitude of the soul for the glory of God (everything and always for the glory of God).

It is in this sense, in my opinion, that study groups and sharing of epochal revelation are important.

For the rest, we are alone in the sphere of our consciousness to choose and make the necessary effort to awaken and deploy our soul.

There are many people who regularly attend church, prayer and study groups, who love to listen to “others,” but who have never really made the persistent effort to unfold their soul, the effort that pierces the ceiling of the human creature to awaken to the spiritual identity that is unique and original to each of us.

Love = Natural service in self-forgetfulness and Adoration eternally amplifies Love.

Thank you, God, for allowing us to feel our soul unfold and thus already touch eternity “here and now” (certainty without a shadow of a doubt).

Amen and thank you God for the inspiration that comes from within!
