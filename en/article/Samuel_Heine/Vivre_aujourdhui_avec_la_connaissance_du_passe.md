We can clearly see that we live in an era of discoveries and scientific research, but also in an era where, thanks to the Internet, general information is accessible to the greatest number of people.

Of course, as an investigator and researcher, you must maintain a critical mind and compare information in order to determine what is true from what is false.

However, we live in an age where everything is gradually being brought to light; and the more people are informed about lies and deceptions, the more a sorting and cleaning is done of all that is erroneous and misleading.

It has already started, but I think that in the future a very large number of philosophical, cosmological and religious approaches (among many other things) will be swept away thanks to this.

Especially those which claim to be revelations based on falsified biblical texts and which do not correspond to the reality of the facts and discoveries.

Between 1947 and 1956, researchers made one of the most important archaeological discoveries in history. 900 Dead Sea Scrolls, containing religious texts in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, were discovered in the Qumran Caves in the West Bank. On Tuesday, March 16, 2021, Israel announced that it had discovered fragments of a biblical manuscript in the same region, the Judean Desert in the West Bank, a territory occupied by Israel since 1967. The discovered fragments are believed to be a 2,000-year-old biblical scroll.

“For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” (Matthew 10:26). “Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known.” ([Mark 4:22](/en/Bible/Mark/4#v22)).

Have a nice day, friends!
