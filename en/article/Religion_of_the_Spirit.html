<p>Religion of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What is meant by religion of the spirit? Firstly it differs widely from the ordinary religions that mankind follows. Essentially these are group activities that virtually always eventuate in the crystallization of a set of rituals and creeds defining what members must do and be.</p>
<p>Inevitably, policing of some kind follows to ensure a minimal degree of adherence and so authoritarianism is born.</p>
<p>Religion of the spirit differs. Firstly it is not a group activity—although it does not prohibit adherents from gathering together. It is a personal quest for truth and it is a personal experience with God that usually results in personal interaction of the individual with the indwelling spirit of God.</p>
<p>God-consciousness and God-awareness always accompany religion of the spirit but not exclusively. Many adherents of authoritarian religion achieve God-consciousness, God- awareness, even a personal relationship with their God. The difference lies in the source of authority.</p>
<p>In a religion of the spirit, for each individual all final authority rests with the indwelling spirit of God in what is purely a personal relationship.</p>
<p>But just as adherents to authoritarian religion can be deluded, so with those who pursue a religion of the spirit. No man or woman on earth is ever free from the danger of self-delusion. Responsibility is their own, between themselves and God, and can apply only to themselves, never to another. This is the struggle that constitutes life’s purpose and the reason for mortal existence—the personal adventure of  individuals in seeking God for themselves and of themselves, and finding him.</p>
<p>Religion of the spirit is arduous, requiring full commitment. Partial commitment is not a possibility. It is inclusive of total dedication to  discovering and doing the will of God for the individual.</p>
<p>Traditional religion involves a formalized system of belief, rituals, and codes of behavior. Adherence to such a religion always implies the offer of reward for compliance and threat for noncompliance. Responsibility for defining the rules and creeds belongs to religious authorities. The responsibility of the individual is limited to their acceptance of the easy pathway of unthinking compliance.
Christianity offers the additional advantage of relief from all burden stemming from sins and guilt through the vicarious sacrificial suffering of Christ on the cross.</p>
<p>Religion of the spirit offers no such advantages. The responsibility of the individual is shared with the indwelling spirit of God. Sincerity is the only demand that stems from higher authority.</p>
<p>Can religion of the spirit be a group as well as individual activity? Provided the group makes no demands upon individuals that would in any way be detrimental to the personal relationship of the individual and their God, there is no known universe rule against group activity—but the individual’s commitment to doing God’s will would have to remain primary and sacrosanct.</p>
<p>However, central to religion of the spirit is the personal quest for truth that requires the individual to embark upon those intellectual discoveries that have their origin in the indwelling Father-Spirit and require us to seek for those personal religious experiences that advance our spirituality and our service to our fellows.</p>
