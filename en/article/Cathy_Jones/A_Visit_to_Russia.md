My invitation to visit St. Petersburg came from Vitaly Kondratjev, a retired physician, who is in process of becoming the Urantia Foundation Representative in Russia. Working through much bureaucratic red tape, he has become a book distributor, making it possible to distribute _The Urantia Book_ in Russia. In 1997 Georges Dupont and Tom Burns presented the Russian translation to the people of Russia, but were able to bring only a limited number of copies. Through Vitaly's relentless efforts, on July 29, 1999, 900 copies of the Russian translation of _The Urantia Book_ were received at Vitaly's office!

I was met at the airport on August 25 by Vitaly, accompanied by Andrey Resnikov, who had agreed to be my translator while in St. Petersburg. Andrey, a Russian native, is a university professor of English and a brother of Michael, who now lives in Finland. These two brothers, who have both read the book in English over five times, were the primary translators of the book that is now in the hands of their fellow countrymen.

The first afternoon and evening were spent meeting with Vitaly and his wife, Irina Mulchrskaja. Andrey, translator-supreme, was at my side throughout the visit, and I was able to look in the faces and carry on uninterrupted conversations. We met in a library near Vitaly and Irina's home.

After first discussing procedures and needs for the Foundation office, we focused on a reader update. Vitaly reported that he has posted meeting notices there in the library, announcing lectures on _The Urantia Book_. They have been attended irregularly by a few people. He has given reading assignments to be discussed at the next meeting, but the participants were not willing to open up for discussion. He felt that people were not accustomed to openly expressing their feelings because of the Communist control for so many years. A meeting had been announced for Friday, stating that a representative from America would be attending. He advised me not to expect too much response, but he thought some people would attend.

On Thursday the magnificent world of St. Petersburg was opened to me. We saw some of the architectural masterpieces of the Emperor Peter the Great and attended a performance of the ballet Swan Lake.

Despite the grandeur of the old castles and bridges, during the years of German occupation and Communist rule, the city has had very little repair to its buildings and wide streets. There was a sharp contrast in eras, and I was amazed to see young women in stylish dresses and high-heeled shoes walking on the cobblestone sidewalks. As I observed the people I noted many mature people wearing old-styled peasant garb. Looking at the serious and unsmiling faces, I saw a proud, strong, courageous people who had survived long cold winters, economic ups and downs, and long years of suppression of individual freedom.

On Friday, the library provided a theatre-style room with about 50 red-velvet stationary chairs, divided by an aisle. As we entered, we were greeted by about 15 people who were waiting with **smiling** faces. As Vitaly, Andrey, and I were seated at the front table, more people arrived, almost filling the room.

Many of the faces were unfamiliar to Vitaly. Evidently, word had circulated about the meeting as a result of the library posting. In his opening remarks, Vitaly announced the formation of the book business and the role he was playing as Foundation Representative. When he told of the first arrival of the books, applause erupted. He then introduced Andrey and me.

I came with no prepared script but brought greetings from the Foundation Trustees, Executive Director and Staff; the Council of Presidents and Vice/Presidents;and the Coordinating Committee. More applause.

When the floor was opened for questions, the first was regarding the Trustees, their names, occupations, how the system worked, their responsibilities. I explained their primary duty was to print the book, keep it inviolate, and provide for a group to disseminate the teachings, which led to an explanation of the IUA. I explained that the organization was simply a scaffolding, a task-oriented organization that meets for the purpose of doing something-to study and practice the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and to give to the world the message that God lives in their hearts and minds and that he will give them guidance for their lives. We are a group of religionists who believe in the religion **of** Jesus, not **about** Jesus. At that time, a beautiful woman who was sitting on the front row stood up and said, “We believe all that you have said. We have been practicing these things for nine years. We are ready to join the IUA now!” At that time 14 people spontaneously stood up, smiling and nodding in agreement.

Irina (a common Russian name) said she been out of town in 1997 when the Russian translation was introduced. However, she had already received the English book in 1990. With the help of a translator she read the entire book and started giving Urantia lectures in many cities.

She, along with the group that had come with her, invited the three of us to a special meeting at her home the next day where we would meet the rest of the group. After further questions and answers, it was agreed to meet the following afternoon, which had not been in our plans, but took priority over all else.

**The Saturday afternoon meeting was one to remember forever!** We met at Irina's third floor, typical Russian apartment. Twenty people had prepared a delicious vegetarian feast, primarily of produce from their own gardens.

Before eating, everyone seated around the living room began telling of their individual search for truth. Present were men and women who were teachers, engineers, accountants, and pensioners. Although they had been taught Communism, many had known, deep down, that there was something more-some knew it was God calling. Their search ended when they attended Irina's lectures.

Sometimes their meetings are held daily. After achieving a firm understanding of the teachings, their second-stage goal is to each form a group like Irina's. Over and over they expressed their gratitude to the Foundation and the translators for giving them _The Urantia Book_ in their native language.

Throughout these soul-baring stories I was reminded of this quote:

> _Religion is so vital that it persists in the absence of learning. It lives in spite of its contamination with erroneous cosmologies and false philosophies; it survives even the confusion of metaphysics. In and through all the historic vicissitudes of religion there ever persists that which is indispensable to human progress and survival: the ethical conscience and moral consciousness_ [UB 101:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_1)

In a demonstration how they contact their Thought Adjusters, we stood in a circle, holding hands, shoulder-to-shoulder, with Irina praying the most beautiful prayer I have ever heard. The feeling that was present in the room was beyond description.

In conversing with Irina, I learned that she holds Masters Degrees in Philosophy and Psychology and is an economist, a playwright, and a producer. Apart from her work, she presents Urantia lectures to groups in many cities. In addition to the many readers scattered in the peripheral areas, there are large groups in various cities: St. Petersburg, 32; Kiev, 56; Kharkov, 100+; Chernovtsi, 50; Dnepropetrovsk, 80; Odessa, 100+; Voronezh, 50; Zhitomir, 40; Moscow, 30; akd Andrey's hometown, 15.

I made a promise they **would** have an IUA in May 2000 .

In parting, I told the group: Lenin attempted to conquer the world **without** God. The people of Russia **will conquer** the world **for God** through love.
