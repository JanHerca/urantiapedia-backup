In the midst
Of all the Master Universe
Does exist
The Universal Love Father
The Universal Love Father
Of Creation.

The nursery station 
for enlightened souls everywhere 
Taking into consideration all their care 
The Universal Love Father 
Love Father
Love Father.

From Creation made
Eons beyond eons ago
But if we are light enough
There ya can surely go.
Our Father never to perish 
Recycling souls to higher planes 
It serves love's purpose

To Creation it is solely a gain.
In the midst
Of the Master Universe
Does exist
The Universal Love Father
The Universal Love Father
Of Creation.

The nursery station
For enlightened souls everywhere
Taking into consideration all their care 
The Universal Love Father
Love Father
Love Father.

Planetary stars are at aree
Being all dimension, time ‘n’ space
The Father He watches
All mankind in every race.
Give all praise ‘n’ devotion
To the center of our local creation
The Universal Love Father
The love to every creation.

_Peter Lisk, Dearborn, Michigan_
