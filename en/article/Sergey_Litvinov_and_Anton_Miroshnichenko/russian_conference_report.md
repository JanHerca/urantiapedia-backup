9 to 11 September, 2016

The first meeting of Russian speaking readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held 9 – 11 September, 2016 at the Novahoff Hotel in Nicholas Uryupino Village near Moscow. This conference was initiated and skilfully organized by Tamila Ragimova from Medellin, Colombia. Twenty five readers attended hailing from Russia, Finland, the Ukraine and the USA.

On the first day over dinner, each of those present spoke about his or her path to finding _The Urantia Book_. Presentations were given in the mornings, then after lunch we broke up into smaller discussion groups.

To give you an idea of the subjects discussed, following is a list of the titles of the presentations and workshops:

In the evenings around the fireplace room of the Hotel Novahoff we held small and pleasant conversations on a variety of topics, which ended with relaxing sing-a-longs accompanied by dry red wine.

There was an active exchange of views on the various approaches to studying _The Urantia Book_. During this discussion, the idea to consolidate the efforts of people interested in promoting _The Urantia Book_ in Russia emerged. Also the ideas of creating a new website and the formation of an organization for Urantia Book readers in Russia were discussed.

On the last day after breakfast we held a discussion about future joint projects and a proposal to hold another conference next year. It was suggested we hold it in St. Petersburg and invite other readers of _The Urantia Book_ who do not speak Russian.

A copy of _The Urantia Book_ was signed and donated to the library of the Novahoff Hotel before we all said our goodbyes and departed the conference.
