For those interested in Urantia movement history, [Square Circles Publishing](https://squarecircles.com/books/) is pleased to announce the availability of _The Urantia Diaries of Harold and Martha Sherman, Volumes I-V_, in both Amazon print-on -demand and Kindle. These books are compiled, transcribed and edited by Matthew Block and me, Saskia Praamsma (my maiden name which I use for Urantia work).

These books are a revision of the five-volume _Sherman Diaries_, which some of you may have purchased several years ago, but contain added material, a number of corrections, and an index. They total around 2,500 pages. No matter what your opinion of Harold Sherman, nowhere else will you find five consecutive years -- 1942-1947 -- of detailed, eyewitness Urantia Forum activity, plus behind-the-scenes correspondence with the Forumites they befriended after leaving Chicago in 1947 leading up to book publication in 1955 .

For an idea of the content, here is a link to the Index which Matthew has painstakingly compiled: https://squarecircles.com/index-to-the-urantia-diaries/

We are currently working on Volume Six (1955-1987) which contains many never-before-seen communications between the Shermans and Forumites, and reveal “the other side” of controversial issues, in letters to Harold Sherman by those who felt they had been unfairly treated by “headquarters” -Robert Burton and Jacques Weiss to name two. The Shermans left Chicago, but they never really got “Urantia” out of their systems and followed the happenings closely until the day they died.

Our motive for publishing these books is to document as much as we can of the history of the revelation, based on firsthand accounts and primary sources. You will not find our opinions or interpretations of events, which we present warts and all. If we are truly dealing with the fifth epochal revelation, then one distant day its history will be told just like the first four are given us in _The Urantia Book_, including I believe, the technique by which the revelation came to earth. As seems to be their method, the superhuman “authors” will first rely on human sources before filling in the blanks. They will not use hearsay, conjecture, or any of the myths and legends that have built up through the decades. We have had a turbulent history and a lot can be learned from studying all sides of it, both the good and the bad.

Lest anyone accuse us of trying to get rich with this project, I can assure you that the opposite is true! All profits from sales (of all of our books) are donated to my charity, [FreeSchools World Literacy](https://freeschools.org/) and the [Bridge Course Program](https://freeschools.org/bridge-course/). Before I pass on to the mansion worlds I intend to make all of this material freely available on [archive.org](https://archive.org/) and google books, where they will remain for posterity.

I am confident that future generations -- looking at it from an unemotional, objective perspective -- will be fascinated by our history, and it is for them that we have produced _The Urantia Diaries_ and most of our other work, including Matthew's source findings. I hope that some of today's readers will also be interested. The authors of _The Urantia Book_ certainly placed a high value on history, as demonstrated by the fact that most of the book is history!
