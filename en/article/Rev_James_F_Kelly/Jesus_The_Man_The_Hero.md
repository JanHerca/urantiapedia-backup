At a recent conference on leadership, one of our group said that he did not have any heroes, and that there were no heroes left in the world.

We began to talk about heroes and leadership, and came to the conclusion that this man was probably right — almost.

Gradually we came to the insight that a leader or a hero needs a com- pelling vision for life's journey. A true hero calls others to share the vision. So, are there any heroes left?

How about Jesus?

I have always thought of Jesus as a friend and savior - not as a hero. But if the real meaning of hero is one who we look up to, a person who possesses unique qualities, someone who is beyond us, and one who calls us to be more than we are, to grow into our talents and gifts, then Jesus is a hero after all.

In searching for heroes, we sometimes look in the wrong places and employ a misplaced set of values. But Jesus as hero calls us to look into ourselves, to the core of who we are as humans.

He is not someone to follow blindly, but someone who urges us to grow from within, to tap our talents and gifts and use the potential we have to become more than we are. He calls us to overcome fear and to move ahead with living, to see more than our narrow needs.

Jesus is the watchman of each of us, and of the world. He watches for us and with us. He is the watchman of history.

This image of Jesus as watchman may become clearer if we recall the Passion narratives of the Gospels. The watchman is not perched upon a high tower in comfort, but from the place of the cross. Jesus has come here to watch over us from within the vulnerability of dying.

“Who is this man?” Matthew asks in chapter 27 — this man with a sign above his head that reads, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” But what a strange place from which to watch. How can death bring life and vision? Later Matthew gives us more understanding. “Forever in death, Jesus calls out faith, and the watching is faithful.”

The centurion who nailed him to the cross professes: “In truth this man was the Son of God.”

This image of Jesus completes the vision of a God who has watched his people from the beginning. Jesus is the guardian, come in flesh.

From [John chapter 1](/en/Bible/John/1): “Indeed, from his fullness, we have all receiked one gift replacing another.” We can affirm in our faith that Jesus still watches over us in the life of his spirit. In his earthly ministry, the 17th chapter of John says: “I have watched over them, I was with them, I kept those you have given me true to your name. I have watched over them.”

Jesus' historic protection is not one of violence, but one which offers and gives peace, giving life itself to all.

There is also the image of Jesus as protector of our souls. Though a watchman and a protector of us in peace — not in violence — there is the cleansing of the temple as told in the second chapter of John. With a whip Jesus drove out the cattle to warn those who would make the temple a marketplace. In so doing, Jesus is protecting the sacred place of God's presence in his time. In our time, it is ourselves and God's presence in us that Jesus is protecting.

As Jesus spoke to the leaders of the time, he spoke of his body as a temple - as well as his own resurrection from the dead. His disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and what he said. This is determination, this is strength, this is leadership — but all in a spirit of peace.

Another image of Jesus as hero occurs when he calms the storm, as found in Matthew, Mark and Luke. “Save us, Lord, for we are lost,” says Matthew. “Master, master we are lost,” states Luke. “Master do you not care, we are lost,” states Mark. And in each instance, Jesus calls his disciples to faith in his leadership, faith in his word. And the power of his word calms the storm, and brings them to safe harbor.

Jesus protects us from all that seeks to destroy the goodness and grace offered to us over and over again by a God who loves us and asks us to give love and faithfulness. Jesus, as hero, is the central figure in our human history. He breaks into our humanness, comes into our darkness and brings us the unique qualities of a God who cares enough to come into our world to become flesh so that we can see and experience God among us.

In our world, Jesus changes forever what is possible for humankind. If we care to accept this hero who watches over us, who protects us — a hero to follow through our earthly journey into a heavenly existence — Jesus then is an eternal hero, not just an earthly one.

Are there any heroes left? Yes, we meet them on the journey. Jesus, however, is a hero on a different plane. Faith is needed to comprehend how to break through the hero stereotypes set upon us by our present culture. He is a hero in time, out of time. He is human, he is divine. He is flesh and blood, spirit and life. Says the 7th chapter of John: “From his heart shall flow streams of living water.”

So, friend, as you talk about heroes, remember to look deep, look beyond. Jesus is our watchman and protector. He calms the storms within us. He lives and gives life.

Now, Jesus calls us to be heroes to each other. And within each of us lies the potential of heroic deeds and a heroic life. So come follow this hero on an eternal journey. God bless you.
