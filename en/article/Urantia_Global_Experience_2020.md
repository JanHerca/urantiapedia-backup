The Urantia Association of Canada and _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship have teamed up to host this gathering. They invite everyone to come together to serve the global community by making a personal contribution to civilization on Urantia.

The Urantia Global Experience is a gathering of minds dedicated to serving God the Supreme through the exploration of solutions for the progressive evolution of civilization. We believe the overall success of this experimental endeavor rests on our spiritual unity - our common motive to express the will of God in our personal daily lives as well as in our social institutions.

The format of this gathering will be a little different than past related experiences. Rather than a series of lectures and workshops, all participants will engage in discussion groups focused on a variety of topics drawn from _The Urantia Book_ (see <a id="a52_251"></a>[Paper 71:4 Progressive Civilization](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p4)). From these discussions, we hope to derive common ideas, solutions, and purpose.

To implement these grand ideals, we need your help. We are currently taking applications for Facilitators and Visionary Exploration presenters, as well as for volunteers.

- **Facilitator Pairs** - are required to moderate the discussions in both Focus Groups and Vision Teams. These discussions will focus on the 12 points of progressive civilization as placed in the context of working with the Supreme, and all Facilitators should be conversant in these areas.

- **Presenters** - provide further discussions (Visionary Explorations) dedicated to the advancement of civilization through current active projects, planned projects, and great ideas for new projects.

- **Volunteers** - include anyone who would like to lend a helping hand doing a great variety of minor chores--also anyone who would like to sing in our choir.

## Visionary Explorations

### Objectives

In serving God the Supreme, we envision participation in Visionary Explorations through active or anticipated projects that enhance the progress of civilization by putting the revelatory teachings into action.

_The Urantia Book_ reveals both the personal nature of religion as well as the need for all people to work together to assist the planet's progress toward light and life. Many readers have ideas about how to advance civilization and some of these visionaries are taking their ideas forward, making them real as they relate to growth in the Supreme. Others have fleshed out their ideas but have yet to find a viable mechanism for their realization, while others have great ideas yet to be implemented.

Outside the Urantia movement, there are numerous individuals and organizations that are trying to achieve similar advances in civilization. The Visionary Exploration portion of UGE 2020 is intended to provide a milieu in which these visionaries can present their projects.

If you have a project and would like to be considered for a place at UGE 2020, there are conditions you need to know:

### Participation versus Presentation

The intent of these Visionary Explorations is to have group participation and discussion, rather than solely making a presentation to the group. Urantia Book readers are well-educated and experienced. The idea is to solicit valuable insights from participants to better understand the possibilities and pitfalls of the proposed or active projects. It is hoped that interested individuals will want to remain involved after UGE 2020 to follow up on their ideas or projects. 

### Fit and Function

All Explorations must fit into the general theme of UGE 2020, Lifting Together - Serving God the Supreme. Potential visionary exploration topics include: education, music and media arts serving the revelation, spiritual unity, leaders and teachers, bringing the revelation to the world, study, service, and so forth. Final selection for the meeting rooms available will be made by the UGE 2020 Advisory Council.

### Pair or Team

All functions of UGE 2020 are coordinated by pairs or teams and we want these Visionary Explorations to be facilitated accordingly. We cannot make much progress on our own and it is, therefore, important that we have a core group of participants committed to each Vision. Our hope is that the pair or team will share the presentation, discussion, and tracking of comments for future involvements.

### Time and Talent

The Visionary Explorations will be limited to two-hour time frames in the three afternoon sessions. These Explorations will be running concurrently with the Vision Teams. The participants involved with these Vision Teams will be collating and condensing the results from the morning's Focus Group discussions.

## Urantia Global Experience

### Platinum Rule

Our demeanor at the Urantia Global

> Experience is grounded in the 'Golden Rule' “Treat others as you would like to be treated” and “Love your neighbor as yourself,” while we strive to lift ourselves up to the “Platinum Rule” - “Love others as God loves them.” <a id="a147_226"></a>[UB 140:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_3)

> “And so I give you this new commandment: That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another. ” <a id="a149_183"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1)

> “If you will only love one another as I am loving you, you shall be my friends, and I will ever speak to you of that which the Father reveals to me.” <a id="a151_152"></a>[UB 180:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_3)

### Session Protocol

Additionally, we respectfully ask that participants do not schedule any committee or organizational meetings during the Focus Group or Vision Team sessions.

> “To enjoy privilege without abuse, to have liberty without license, to possess power and steadfastly refuse to use it for selfaggrandizement - these are the marks of high civilization.” <a id="a157_188"></a>[UB 48:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_8)
