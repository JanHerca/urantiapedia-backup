## Urantia University Institute – Now Accepting Application**s**

Following several years of development and testing by a team of curriculum developers and experienced students from the major Urantia organizations, The Urantia Book Teacher Education Program (TEP) is now accepting applications for the 2024 – 2025 academic year.

The hybrid one-year training program features a five-day, in-person orientation and training session at Urantia Foundation, followed by three trimesters of online study and weekly training and discussion sessions on Zoom. It is designed for people who are serious students of the Urantia revelation with a track record of participation in study groups and Urantia Book education programs.

- Do you feel called to teach or minister to the spiritual family of God in light of the Urantia revelation and the teachings of Jesus?

- Do you have a strong inner prompting to share advanced teachings regarding God, the cosmos, our planetary history, and our eternal destiny?

- Would you like to hone the skills that would make you a more effective teacher, leader, and ambassador of the revelation?

- Do you think you would benefit from a thorough review and integration of the major themes and concepts of _The Urantia Book_ that would enable you to better articulate the revelation?

Your participation in the Teacher Education Program will give you space to address all of these desires in the company of knowledgeable and experienced instructors, and alongside similarly motivated students.

This program. . .

- Offers a comprehensive review of the major themes and concepts of _The Urantia Book_.
- Provides a useful blend of content knowledge and skill-building practices.
- Prepares motivated students from around the world to effectively present the ideas and ideals of the Urantia revelation to their native cultures.
- Emphasizes the importance of personal worship practice.
