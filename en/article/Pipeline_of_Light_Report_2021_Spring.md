During the past six months, our Pipeline of Light volunteers placed thirteen hundred and forty-eight copies of _The Urantia Book_ into seventeen countries. Your donations to the Pipeline helped us deliver books to readers and study groups in Mexico, Zimbabwe, Canada, the United States, Ukraine, Chile, Germany, Cameroon, Argentina, the Philippines, Bermuda, New Zealand, Ghana, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela, Uganda, and Puerto Rico.

Books sent out this period include 1191

English books, 122 Spanish translations, one French, twenty German, four Russian, and ten Portuguese.

The current effort brings our Pipeline all-time totals to 11,040 copies of _The Urantia Book_ placed into ninety-one countries around the world. Many thanks to the wonderful volunteers who keep this flow of books moving into the world for us!
