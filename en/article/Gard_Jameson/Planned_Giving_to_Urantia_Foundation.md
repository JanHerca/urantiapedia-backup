_By Gard Jameson, Treasurer, Urantia Foundation, Boulder City, Nevada, USA_

Urantia Foundation's legacy has been, is, and will be to preserve inviolate the text of _The Urantia Book_. With its new Standard Reference Text that was created in collaboration with _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship, we have created an elegant quality of textual integrity in perpetuity. Urantia Foundation is endeavoring to do all in its power to carry out its sacred trust and mission to seed _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings throughout the world.

_The Urantia Book_ Internet School is breaking new ground in providing quality education in English, and soon, Spanish and Portuguese will follow. There will continue to be educational forums hosted at 533 W Diversey Parkway to promote in-depth understanding and appreciation of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Part of the charge of the Trustees is to make sure that its trust is financially stable. To that end, the Trustees have initiated a program designed to invite planned gifts by those who share the vision of seeding the Fifth Epochal Revelation throughout the world. As Ralph Zehr, a longtime reader, asks, “What greater gift and opportunity do we have?”

Planned gifts represent the responsible distribution of significant wealth during one's life or at the time of our passing onto the Mansion Worlds. Significant wealth is any amount over $1,000. Planned gifts can be incorporated into one's will or trust very simply by using proper language. There are a variety of trust formats that can provide ongoing financial support for the donor while providing a significant gift at one's passing. Urantia Foundation has available some helpful information and guidance for making planned gifts. To receive information on planned giving, please contact Jay Peregrine at +1-773-525-3319, or urantia@urantia.org.

We encourage you to consider a planned gift to benefit the spreading of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Each and every Trustee of Urantia Foundation thanks you for your consideration of such a gift.

Through our work with the Expanded Board of Trustees, with wise representation from all parts of the planet, we seek to be worthy stewards of this revelation. We greatly appreciate your input and your assistance. May our generation be the one to secure the long-term financial stability of this Epochal Revelation as we bring it to the peoples of our beleaguered planet! May each of us find a way to be a blessing through the Urantia
