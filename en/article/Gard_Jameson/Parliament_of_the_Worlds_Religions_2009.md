_By Gard Jameson, Treasurer, Urantia Foundation, Nevada, USA_

Urantia Foundation has been invited to provide a spiritual offering at the 2009 Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia from December 3-9, 2009.

Thanks to the good efforts of Kathleen Swadling and many others, there will be a large gathering of readers of _The Urantia Book_ at this Parliament. We will have a booth and will provide the book to interested attendees. We are also producing a DVD to introduce the book.

The first Parliament of the World's Religions was held in Chicago in 1893. One hundred years later, in 1993, the second Parliament was held —again in Chicago.

At this second Parliament, Peter Laurence gave a presentation about _The Urantia Book_, and thanks to Peter and a number of other readers, we are well recognized by the leadership of the Parliament and the leadership of the world interfaith community.

The Parliament of the World's Religions now takes place once every five years and is a unique gathering of kindred spirits from all over the planet. During prior Parliaments, we presented the book to a variety of souls, including Hans Kung (Catholic theologian) in Chicago in 1993, Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama in South Africa in 1999, and Jane Goodall and Wayne Teasdale in Barcelona in 2004.

I invite any of you who are interested to join us in Melbourne for this very special event, which is, in my opinion, contributing to the advent of Light and Life on this planet.
