by _Gard Jameson_ 

Steve Dreier has been a friend for 45 years and continues to be a friend, though he has recently ascended to the mansion worlds. Like Jesus, he would often pose questions more than give answers, suggesting that truth is more about an ongoing dialogue than a specific conclusion.

Steve was a consummate student of the *The Urantia Book.* His smile and thoughtful engagement were infectious to those who knew him. Many are the times that I would seek his spiritual counsel on serious matters in my own spiritual journey. Always would I feel better after receiving his advisement. 

Those that knew him know that he had a passion for the texts that were utilized by the Revelatory Commission in their presentation of the revelation. Not many have taken up the mantle to investigate those texts and their authors, but it is an important field of inquiry for any serious student of the revelation. He and I would spend a great deal of time discussing this material and the implications. Mostly, I knew Steve as a friend. I was cheered by his presence and by his gracious manner. Watching and being with Steve and Bobbie was an inspiration for both my wife, Florence, and me. We got to spend some of the last days of his life with the two of them, reading the revelation, pondering the imponderables, and sharing humor and memories. Steve embodied what it means to be a son of God. For that I shall ever be thankful!

I look forward to seeing you again on high, brother Steve, in the eternal adventure!
