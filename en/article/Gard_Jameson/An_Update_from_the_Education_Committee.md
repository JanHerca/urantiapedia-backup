_By Gard Jameson, trustee, Urantia Foundation, Nevada, United States_

The Education Committee has been busy focusing on two outreach strategies. The first is the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS), and the second is educational seminars to be held at Urantia Foundation in Chicago.

UBIS, founded by Dorothy Elder and directed by Georges Michelson-Dupont, had more than 420 students participating in 2014. Today classes are being offered in English, Spanish, and French. We encourage you to visit the school at ubis. urantia.org and consider taking a class. The next trimester will begin in January. Who knows? You may be so inspired that after taking a class, you might want to become a teacher.

With the renovation of the Foundation's headquarters building located at 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago, educational seminars are becoming more popular. In the last quarter of 2014, two seminars were well attended: A women's retreat was hosted by Line St-Pierre from Québec, Canada, and a workshop on the soul was hosted by Marta Elders from Connecticut, United States.

In 2015, at least three seminars are planned. Line St-Pierre will host another retreat for women, and Marvin Gawryn will host a seminar on the socialization of religion. In November, there will be a scientific seminar focused on the study of facts from a number of different scientific disciplines that support the existence of God. Students of _The Urantia Book_ with a passion and background in science are invited to this science seminar. It will be limited to twelve persons.

In June of 2016, source authors of _The Urantia Book_ will be the topic of a seminar.

If you are interested in any of the above seminars, please write to Joanne Strobel at joanne@urantia.org.

You might be interested to know that the Foundation's basement might be converted to an educational center, including archives pertaining to _The Urantia Book_. If you have materials related to the history and content of _The Urantia Book_, please consider donating them to Urantia Foundation.
