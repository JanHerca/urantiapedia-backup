This is the day that the Lord has made and we are glad in it.
Rejoice for ours is the wealth of the Kingdom of the Lord.
For we are altogether rich in spirit and strong in faith.

This is the week the Lord has made and we grow in it daily.
Rejoice for ours is the understanding of universal living.
For we have become brothers and sisters of the one Lord.

This is the month the Lord has made to care for others.
Rejoice for ours is the experience of the highest love.
For we have understood that to share is itself to live.

This is the year that the Lord has made for us.
Rejoice in the joy of our understanding and experience.
For we have found His guidance to be sufficient and true.

This is the life that the Lord has given us and we are glad!
Rejoice that we are under the watch care of the Sovereign!
For we have become one under His love and shed our isolation from each other forever and forever!

For we have stumbled in our imperfection:
In our solitude we have separated ourselves from His truth.
In our aloneness we have experienced the impotence of our ego.
In our isolation we have been blind to the cause of love.
In our arrogance we have refused to care for our fellows.
In our selfishness we have found a terrible emptiness
and there is no health in us, for we are lost
without the guiding love of the Father.

And yet, in divine compassion:
He extends His mercy and forgiveness in eternal measure.
He pours out His love even to all of humanity.
He enriches our lives that we may know His truth.
He grants us eternal life in the victory of our faith.

What a miracle! What a miracle!
Indeed, this is the day the Lord has made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it — forever and ever! Amen!
