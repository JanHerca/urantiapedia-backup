One nail will hold only two boards together, but a keg of nails will go far in building a house. The prayers of one person are heard; but when many people concentrate their prayers on a single subject, surprising results are often seen. When we unite our prayers, we also have a sense of communicating with each other; and for farflung Urantians this can be exhilarating. When one prays, and knows other Urantians are doing the same, there is a warm feeling that causes happiness to bubble to the top.

Last year on a specific day, at a designated time, many Urantians were united by prayer. It was one of those ideas that blooms and just grows. Maybe it would be desirable to pray together regularly. On the first Sunday of each month at 7:00 p.m. Chicago time, we could pray to be shown how we can, as individuals and as a group, bring the URANTIA teachings into the lives of more people. What a boon we would receive.
