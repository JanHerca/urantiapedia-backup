_By Tamara Wood, Urantia Foundation Staff_

A few weeks ago, in April and May, Urantia Foundation, Urantia Association International, and _The Urantia Book_ Fellowship sponsored a booth at the 34th International Book Fair in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A team of readers dedicated their time and energy by hosting the booth during the fair. The team consisted of local readers and readers from Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and the United States.

This year the fair drew record crowds and hundreds of people visited our booth during a three and a half week period. It was inspiring to witness the tact and grace displayed by our volunteers as they interacted with all who passed by. On several occasions, groups of children, ages 12 to 18 , visited our booth and engaged in lively conversation.

Two readers, Alessandro Guarneri and Luis Miguel Morales, created a video with beautiful photographs of nature and quotes from _The Urantia Book_. The video was accompanied by original music composed by Luis Miguel. It ran continuously on a large plasma screen and captured the attention of many attendees.

And now, for the Cristina Benedetti pièce de résistance: A distribution contract with Kier, a large Argentine distributor, was secured. They had a large booth and dedicated an entire shelf to $E I$ Libro de Urantia. All people interested in purchasing a book were escorted there. El Libro de Urantia is now readily available in Argentina.

A special thanks to all involved including: Augustin Arellano, Graciela Cristina Benedetti, Bert Cobb, Costas Diamantopoulos, Nicolás Gelman, Alessandro Guaeneri, Marian Hughes, Luis Miguel Morales, Nelida Oliver, Horacio Rico, Rogerio Reis da Silva, Carlos Rubinsky and Jorge Wilcik.
