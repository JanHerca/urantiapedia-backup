_By Tamara Wood, Sales Manager for Urantia Foundation_

While attending the annual international book fair in Guadalajara, Mexico, last November, I quickly discovered how popular _El Libro de Urantia_ is among Spanish-speaking distributors. One distributor in particular caught my attention with his enthusiastic longterm vision of creating solid availability of the book in stores throughout a large territory. After extensive discussions, we signed a contract to distribute the book via Tarots del Mundo in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Uruguay.

Orlando Ashman and his wife Patsue are dedicated to developing the market for _The Urantia Book_ with reliable, accountable, and clientoriented business practices. This approach is both refreshing and promising given the many difficulties Urantia Foundation has experienced in distributing the book in Latin America. As the market expands, we look forward to having a strong distribution system so that all who search for _The Urantia Book_ can find it.
