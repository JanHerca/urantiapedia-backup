_By Michael Barrett, California, United States_

Before I took my first class with the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) in 2013, I remember being very nervous and unsure of what to expect. For one, I was not (and am still not) very computer-savvy. For two, I hadn't been to any type of school in over twenty years. And for three, I did not know how much time the class would really take. Besides, I simply never felt a need, had a desire, nor thought of myself as one who would go back to school.

When I took my first class on the resurrection of Jesus, I was pleasantly surprised by the inspiring support of the staff and the comfort of finally finding fellow truth seekers to be students with. The time constraints I had worried about were all but nonexistent. All students partake and proceed at their own pace, and ample time is allotted for all weekly requirements. The insights and pure wisdom that get thrown around a virtual classroom are simply mesmerizing!

During this course, I learned so much that I took another, and then another, and then another. Now, in between semesters, I find myself greatly anticipating the next classes to be offered. One can hardly imagine just how much soul expansion and spirit attunement takes place in one ten-week period. I would have never thought a single online class could teach and inspire us so much, not to mention align us with eternal truth and bring more meaning and fulfillment into our lives. I was spiritually “blown away,” and I thank the Good Lord still to this day for the experiences during my first class.

One thing I have learned along the way is that continual spiritual growth truly leads to the peace that surpasses all understanding. The classes with UBIS have helped me tremendously to achieve this lasting inner peace. The Teacher-Facilitators are not intimidating and inspire much more than instruct. The wonderful people I have met from all over the world have truly broadened my personal perspective and brightened my spiritual horizons.

If there is anything I could do for anyone who is serious about learning of the spiritual realities revealed in _The Urantia Book_, it would be to encourage that person to take a UBIS class and experience the power of the Spirit that guides us all and somehow permeates these virtual classrooms. If learning how to experience God's peace, joy, and love for you is of interest at all, UBIS provides a platform for people from all parts of this planet to do just that.

I should also mention that other people have noticed a change in me for the better. I find, just from the objectivity and assurance these classes have provided, that now more people are asking me about things they didn't ask me about before I started studying online. Friends and family frequently ask me about God, Jesus, life, and other topics/questions they have about spirituality in general. And (almost) always I can answer much better than I ever could have before I started taking classes with UBIS.

To those behind the scenes at UBIS who volunteer their time to make this superb school possible, thank you very much! You have compassionately developed and are magnificently maintaining a place to learn about the infinite love of God and the incredible life e offers His beloved children here on earth.

May the Father above hold us all in the palm of His hand and turn us around which way He will.
