## Bio

**Bobbie Dreier** is a retired teacher and the grandmother of Matthew and Jason. Bobbie and her husband Steve have celebrated more than 50 wedding anniversaries. She has worked to foster an “atmosphere of communion” at Urantia Book gatherings in preconference retreats, daily meditation sessions and worship programs. She was president of _The Urantia Book_ Society of Greater New York. Currently Bobbie is a member of the Education Committee and has been actively involved in local and national _Urantia Book_ activities with Steve for over 40 years.

**Francis Oliver Lynn** had the good fortune of discovering _The Urantia Book_ when he was twenty years old. The day after he spent an evening walking on the campus of Notre Dame communing with God, he was given the gift of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. A newly found friend had placed the book in his hands and said, “I have a feeling that this is something that will appeal to you,” an interesting intuition since she had never opened the book. A window into the universe had been opened and Francis has never stopped peering into the nature of God since that moment.
