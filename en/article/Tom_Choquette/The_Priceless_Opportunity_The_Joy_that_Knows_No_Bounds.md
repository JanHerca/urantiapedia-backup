_Urantia Book_ readers are aware of the fact that we have been blessed with being born in a Superuniverse that represents equally all attributes of the Trinity. We live in the Superuniverse of Orvonton which represents equally the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Of course, we all know that coming from such a Superuniverse, one never has to worry about being sent back to the worlds of time and space to acquire more knowledge or experience.

What we may not take the time to recognize from this reality is the incredible opportunity that presents itself to each of us to grow in the experience and understanding of each personal aspect of the Trinity, _Love, Mercy, and Ministry_, as well as the association between all three! We have all of the spiritual helpers and tools that we need to advance experientially and collectively towards an understanding of the Trinity on a level of the finite that is so far removed from the “normal evolution” of a world. The uniqueness of our environment and its prospects should be absolutely exhilarating to those of us who have been blessed to live on such a world at such a time.

How do we learn to reflect the Trinity in our lives? How do we reflect the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in a way that allows us to grow in grace, and to radiate those realities to our brothers and sisters of this planet? I believe we learn to reflect the Trinity by embracing the quality of each aspect of the Trinity: love, mercy and ministry, in our daily lives. It isn't enough that we love, we must demonstrate mercy to be allowed to love; it isn't enough that we manifest mercy, we must serve to be allowed to manifest such forgiveness. And service/ministry is perhaps the cornerstone to all spiritual growth. What I would like to touch upon in this article is service or ministry, whichever term you find more helpful in your reaching out to serve your community. 

Service or ministry is the essence or fragrance of the Spirit. She is a wonderful lady and the spark of all that is life. She is represented on this planet by our local Universe Mother Spirit, and Her energy and nurturing are everywhere. To me She represents the way of Joy. It is through Her, and Her needs that I have been blessed with unlimited opportunities to serve. She is a powerful advocate and will unerringly steer you towards the Father in your heart. Spend time with Her through the action of service, and know you are loved beyond measure and that you are a child of God.

As students of the Urantia Papers there are at least four major areas of service in which an individual may choose to become involved.

1. **Direct service to the revelation**. Some of the ways in which we support the revelation include a complete reading and understanding of _The Urantia Book_ itself, the formation of study groups, the formation of Fellowship Societies, IUA charters, and The Spiritual Fellowship groups, helping with the publication and distribution of _The Urantia Book_ and its translations worldwide, the publication and distribution of secondary works, publications, newsletters, web sites, and other methods of mass communication which make the revelation accessible to a larger audience. Marketing _The Urantia Book_ in our private lives and in the community in which we live are also methods which work directly towards introducing _The Urantia Book_ as a revelation to the rest of our brothers and sisters on this wonderful planet we call home.

There are several excellent reasons for endeavoring to fulfill one or more of these goals, for the exposure the revelation receives, and the personal growth one gains through participating in outreach that in time is destined to transform the world we live on. There would appear to be a low level of personal risk associated with this type of service. If one who is offered this “alternative belief system” chooses to reject it, we very seldom blame ourselves. They are doubtlessly “not ready” or “don't need” this advanced revelation in their lives. 

2. **Service as we “pass by.”** Most of the really important things which Jesus said or did seemed to happen casually, “as he passed by.” We are told there was so little of the professional, the wellplanned, or the premeditated in the Master's earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, “He went about doing good.” <a id="a50_412"></a>[[UB 171:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_9)]

Jesus was an enlightened Son of God. He was empowered by an unquestionable union with His Father within. Jesus' service was so powerful and selfless that when called a “good teacher” he responded by saying, “Why do you call me good? None is good but God.” <a id="a52_256"></a>[[UB 196:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_2)] It may be more correct in today's terminology to say that Jesus _ministered_ as he passed by.

Jesus didn't just fix a copier or carry some groceries or sweep the steps or put gas in the car or give a person a book or any of the other thoughtful services we do on a daily basis for our loved ones and neighbors. Because of Jesus' spiritual connection He could perceive their real inner needs as he ministered to their outer needs. Jesus had the insight and gift to empower people as he passed by. Jesus was extraordinary at this because he was so in tune with the Father's will in all things. Jesus was and is the master of “serving as He passed by.” If we devote our lives to such a service example, great things can and do happen.

Initially, because of our humanness and lack of spiritual attainment, “serving as we pass by” may not be enough. “As we pass by” may become a numbness, a justification for not stepping out of our comfort zone to serve in ways that not only require more effort and sacrifice, but attune us more closely with the will of the Father. We may need to immerse ourselves in social service.

There are those that would suggest that the saying of “doing good as you pass by” may be an opiate for the readers and believers of the Urantia Revelation. An opiate because it may cause us to miss the grand opportunity of social service and consequent growth available to us on this rare and unique world of the cross. An opiate because in the pleasantries of convenient and rewarding service to others we can lose track of the spiritual growth made real from reaching out and serving in an environment that we are not familiar with, an environment that forces us to rid ourselves of judgment and rely on faith and guidance from above to reach out and be effective.

The personal risk in the Jesusonian type of “service as you pass by” is self-evident in that you give up all so that you may be born again of the spirit and with power. The world is in desperate need of this service. This type of service is also included in the fourth category of services. The _self-retaining_ type of service “as you pass by” appears to have a low personal risk factor in that it requires little change or growth in us. It makes us feel good and in most cases is welcome and accepted by those we serve.

3. **Service for society, ministry to those less fortunate**. “Service — more service, increased service, difficult service, adventurous service, and at last divine and perfect service-is the goal of time and the destination of space.” <a id="a62_236"></a>[[UB 28:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_17)] The Jesusonian gospel is “the Fatherhood of God and the sonship and consequent brotherhood of all men, which is personally realized in loving ministry and social service.” <a id="a62_454"></a>[[UB 94:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p4_10)] “The contact of the mortal mind with its indwelling Adjuster, while often favored by devoted meditation, is more frequently facilitated by wholehearted and loving service in unselfish ministry to one's fellow creatures.” <a id="a62_721"></a>[[UB 91:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_1)] There are three fruits of the spirit associated with service: _loving service, unfailing goodness, and merciful ministry_. As a matter of fact, there are those that would say that the majority of the fruits of the spirit cannot be realized without the benefit of transforming social service.

To differentiate between “serving as you pass by” and social service let's define social service as the act of going out to specifically serve a population that the obstacles or challenges of life have left damaged and deserted by the brotherhood of humankind. Of the many categories that would fit this description let me name a few. Seniors without income or close family, homeless families, homeless youth, HIV aids patients, the mentally disabled, the unemployed, the uneducated, the hungry, the abused, the list goes on and on. From a spiritual perspective, maybe more accurately described as the hurt, the despairing, the lost, the beaten, the abused (did I mention that before?), the forgotten, this list goes on and on too. Can you hear them calling you? Have you heard them in the past through the tumult of your mind, conveniently shut out by our everyday distractions?

When we move out to serve in this environment, we start the process of becoming other than what we are. We must step outside of our comfort zone and rely on our spiritual guides to lead us into effective ministry. There is no substitution. I will repeat this one more time because of the value inherent in understanding that you can not get from here to there without moving......there is NO substitution! To grow spiritually we must change. To change we MUST serve. It's scary. It's hard. It requires that you sacrifice a part of yourself for His-self. It requires an extra dose of all of the fruits of the spirit.

You don't feel adequate, you feel unprepared, you're nervous about doing more damage, as well as other valid reasons why your mandate to service does not apply just now. Why should those wallowing in desperation and despair have to wait for another? Why do you continue to live as though others could do the job better? They can't! You are being called to service even now as you read these words. None can replace you in partnership with Jesus. You are more than adequate. You are the beginning of hope for all those you will courageously go out and serve. By example you shall lead them. By example you shall lead those of us around you that need to serve by your side. By example, step by step you will be transformed from obedience to your human will to that of the Divine.

We are blessed with a veritable smorgasbord of service opportunities. Perhaps no other world at any other time has had an environment where the children of God are needed so desperately to help in the healing of their cosmic family in partnership with God. This type of service is definitely high risk. You risk all that you have for all that you can become. Where there is great risk, there is great reward! “The Gods have decreed, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive,’ and said your Master Son, ‘He who would be greatest among you let him be server of all.’” <a id="a70_569"></a>[[UB 28:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_18)]

4. Ministry. Living the Gospel. Becoming Christ like. Trading your mind in for the mind of Jesus. “... but what is now most needed is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men. Modern culture must become spiritually baptized with a new revelation of Jesus' life and illuminated with a new understanding of his gospel of eternal salvation. And when Jesus becomes thus lifted up, he will draw all men to himself.” <a id="a72_514"></a>[[UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1)]

Jesus taught a living religion that impelled its believers to engage in the doing of loving service. We must create and nourish a ministry of second milers who are dedicated to living and loving as He taught His disciples to live and love and serve. “I lived my life in the flesh to show how you can, through loving service, become God-revealing to your fellow men even as, by loving you and serving you, I have become God-revealing to you.” <a id="a74_442"></a>[[UB 193:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_5)] The great challenge to readers of the Urantia Papers is how to facilitate this type of growth. We can agree with it, debate it, demean it, intellectualize it, ignore it, but for it to become a reality we must live it. It is probably the highest risk of all of the modes of service available to us. Spiritual growth is something that one must do alone. The “we” must be taken out of this type of service and the “I” must go forth to find and realize its ultimate destiny in service to our Father in heaven and in our hearts. At this point service is no longer an applicable definition of what one is doing. A better definition may be Privilege. We first serve because we are compelled to serve, we then serve because we have the opportunity to, and finally we serve because it is a Divine Privilege.

As I read back over this article I find emptiness within its boundaries that I feel compelled to address. In my own life experience with service and ministry, I was figuratively dragged screaming and kicking from the womb of indecision, guilt, and the knowledge that I should be doing something more meaningful with my life. I was fortunate that I had friends who helped and encouraged me to move outside of myself, and trust in the spirit to guide and sustain me on my journey towards the fulfilling and irreplaceable experiences of service.

My journey began with the “street kids” of Seattle, Washington. They, of course, were not worthy. I was a harsh judge of all that they represented in life. I would like to thank a close friend of mine, Tom Pirie, for holding on tightly as I tried to bolt, and helping guide me into the birth of true service. You see, they are worthy.

I've had a call to ministry for several years. In my mind, of course, I was not worthy. I was a harsh judge of myself and all of my shortcomings. Who was I to represent my Father to the people of this planet? I would like to thank another close friend of mine, Meredith Sprunger, for allowing me my humanness and calling me to ministry in the face of all my failings. You see, I am worthy. And you are, too!

The world is in desperate need of those who can accept the fact that they are worthy. The only pre-requisite that I know of is to be a son or daughter of our Father, and to aspire to be just like Him. Now comes the hard work. Now comes the priceless opportunity. Now comes the beginning of the Joy that knows no boundaries. Now is the time to grow in grace. Now is the time for you to start representing your God on this planet. There is more help for you on your journey than you can ever imagine. However, you must move. Please, this planet needs you! Our Father needs you.
