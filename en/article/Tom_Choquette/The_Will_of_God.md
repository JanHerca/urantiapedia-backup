> “The Will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any [emphasis added] potential alternative. To do the Will of God, therefore, is the progressive experience of becoming more and more like God, and God is the source and destiny of all that is good and beautiful and true [emphasis added].” <a id="a42_328"></a>[[UB 130:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_7)]

To simplify the will of God in our finite lives is to live our lives in such a way that our Beloved can live through us. This is the way of God.

> “Never forget there is only one adventure which is more satisfying and thrilling than the attempt to discover the will of the living God, and that is the supreme experience of honestly trying to do that divine will. And fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation [emphasis added].” <a id="a46_321"></a>[[UB 155:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_11)]

God asks us to love everyone. But what exactly does that mean and how can we gauge whether or not we are living up to our potential to go all in with the Beloved? This is where the fruits of the spirit come in.

To some of the fruits of the spirit I have added additional definitions such as temperance, which means more than to abstain from alcohol and long-suffering, which can easily be misconstrued. For the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering (uncomplaining, tolerant, forgiving, patient), gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance (selfcontrol), loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace.

> “The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God [emphasis added] ...” <a id="a52_154"></a>[[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1)]

These fruits of the spirit are what the Beloved does through us. These are a part of a list that incorporates the supreme values that our Adjuster brings to us when Hechooses us as potential eternal partners. This is the human part of the agreement. This is how we share our inner life with God, we allow Him to live through us by adopting His fruits and doing our best to incorporate these aspects of love in our lives.

> “But first of all I am going to practice worshiping God by learning how to do the will of God on earth; that is, I am going to do my best to treat each of my fellow mortals just as I think God would like to have him treated [emphasis added]. And when we live this sort of a life in the flesh, we may ask many things of God, and he will give us the desire of our hearts that we may be the better prepared to serve our fellows [emphasis added]. And all of this loving service of the children of God enlarges our capacity to receive and experience the joys of heaven, the high pleasures of the ministry of the spirit of heaven.” <a id="a56_628"></a>[[UB 131:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p10_5)]

We are told that our soul either expands or contracts by the choices that we make. That we are either moving towards God or away from Him. There is no standing still in our pursuit to do the will of God both within and without. To love is one of the Divine's blessings we have been gifted with. All true love comes from God, through us, and if we choose, we can share this love by distributing Its power to all of Mom's children that we touch.

The true blessings of our revelation is not in the reading, it never was, but in the living. In the process of becoming what we were all individually meant to be, living conduits of the Father's love to this war-torn, heart torn, “planet of the cross,” we truly start to do the will of God in our lives. We have a revelation that tells us this.

This is why you are a part of my most precious family. We all have been blessed by a revelation we can live through. It is in the life suggested by our revelation that we can choose to do the will of God and radiate that love of God out into the world around us. Think about it. Each one of us has been chosen by a unique part of the Divine to be Their guide during our stay on this breath-taking planet. If we agree to do this, the Beloved promises to be our guide into the limitless, infinite, and eternal adventures to come. We are asked to love and to teach others how to love.

> “We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself.” <a id="a64_134"></a>[[UB 106:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_11)]

When I first heard about the fruits of the spirit, I thought they just magically appeared as I worked on other aspects of my life associated with becoming spiritual. Meditating, praying, going to church, deeper studies and dissemination of _The Urantia Book_, and serving our community and the larger community, are just a few of the examples that I thought would magically gift me with the Father's fruits in our life.

I don't remember when I realized that the fruits were given to me to adopt into my life through active participation in the transforming of my will to the Father's will - that the fruits were an offer from God to allow Him to experience, through us all, life in the finite. What an amazing revelation! By their fruits you shall know them.

> “Whosoever wills to do the will of God shall comprehend the validity of spiritual values.” <a id="a70_93"></a>[[UB 101:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p10_6)]

I believe this means that before we can even participate in the discovery of spiritual values we need to make a sincere decision to do the “will of God” in our lives. For those of us who recognize this and have been so blessed, has there ever been another choice?

I made a conscious decision to try my hardest to adopt all of the values that God has gifted me to allow His love to flow through me into the world. Am I even close to accomplishing this eternal task? Of course not, but radiating His love to all those around us is my true heart's desire. We each can choose to be Divine lovers. All we need to do is work on cultivating the fruits of the spirit in our daily lives which is identical to cultivating the will of God in our lives. And to do this we partner with God and ask for daily help. I ask for your help and encouragement on our mutual journey towards the light of a billion stars and beyond, as I pledge to encourage and help you.

> “And Jesus answered: ‘The kingdom of heaven consists in these three essentials: first, recognition of the fact of the sovereignty of God; second, belief in the truth of sonship with God; and third, faith in the effectiveness of the supreme human desire to do the will of God [emphasis added] — to be like God. ...’” <a id="a76_318"></a>[[UB 140:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_9)]

I promise in the future that I shall work hard on loving everyone, forgiving everything, and judging not. This then is the Jesusonian way.

Loving you all more each and every day.
In Her service,
With His grace

The Will of God, Part 2 “Mercy” ... Coming to a publication near you this summer.

> "Jesus disclosed to this world a higher quality of righteousness than justice mere technical right and wrong. Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them. The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom. Jesus brought a new method of living to Urantia. Hetaught us not to resist evil but to find through him a goodness which effectually destroys evil [emphasis added]. The forgiveness of Jesus is not condonation; it is salvation from condemnation. Salvation does not slight wrongs; it makes them right. True love does not compromise nor condone hate; it destroys it [emphasis added]. The love of Jesus is never satisfied with mere forgiveness. The Master's love implies rehabilitation, eternal survival.” <a id="a88_886"></a>[[UB 188:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2)]

We are blessed with the privilege of helping God to help others, so that they too may embark on an eternal journey, seeking and partnering with the Infinite in all things.
