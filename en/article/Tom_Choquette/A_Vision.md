By _Tom Choquette_

I had a vision the other day I would like to share with my spiritual family. I'm gifted with nudges from time to time but have never experienced a vision before.

I was in my grove pondering the challenges of doing and sharing the will of God and it dawned on me to ask Mom for some help. I was moved immediately into this vision. A vision as real as life.

I was sitting at a table in a room full of light. The light was everywhere present, ambient and beautiful. The table was a large circle in front of me and melted away into the distance, into the soft light. Sitting around the table were an amazing variety of beings. Not very clear in definition but rock solid in presence and reality. I could feel and breathe in the presence of the Holy. It was unbearably beautiful.

All of these marvelous beings were looking at me. Waiting for something. And then a question from them formed in my mind, “What do you bring to the table?” A question directed to me from the collective body. A genuine request for knowledge of my experience with... what?

The question filled my mind and my soul. I immediately started sorting through my life experiences and accumulated knowledge that I could share with these wondrous beings. I thought about sharing my knowledge of the revelation and realized that some of the very beings present helped compile and transmit it and knew it more intimately than I ever would. I started to talk about the problems I'd witnessed coming from a planet in rebellion, and realized that there were beings present that had lived through every level of the rebellion. Then I started to share my experience and position on their governing of our planet, and realized that the spiritual administrators present had millions of years of experience in running all phases of the government of our local universe. I tried describing what it was like to be an ascending free will creature and realized that around this table were countless others that had climbed out of the depth of nothingness and into an eternal embrace with our Universal Father and had come back to serve those of us willing to start the climb. In desperation I started talking about our Creator Son Michael, and His sojourn as Jesus on our planet 2,000 years ago, and realized that most present had witnessed His crucifixion as well as knowing Him intimately. I started to panic.

What could I share with this amazing group of beings? What did I have that was uniquely mine? What in fact did I “bring to the table?” I started to freeze up inside. It was hard to think or even breathe. And then I felt this gentle nudge. So gentle that at first, I thought to ignore it. It became more constant and I looked within towards the direction of the nudge. There cuddled up to me was my infinite partner and best friend, that fragment of God that taught me to love, show mercy, and minister to His children. That piece of God that I chose to share my life with. I flashed back to all those times I had let Him come into my life and live through me on our wonderful planet. I realized that we had become one and that my spiritual siblings around that table had come to hear what He brought to the table through His unique life shared with me. As He started to tell our story to those at the table, I relaxed back into His arms and there was peace in heaven and in my soul. My vision slowly faded.

Love you all so much, May we all more fully turn our lives over to that source of grace within.
