New Mexico, Synergia Ranch April 4-7
Chicago, Urantia Foundation, September 12-15
Michigan, The Red Poppy B\&B Retreat Center, Sept. 19-22

In a sacred circle of trust with other women, we invite you to explore the dignity of being Daughters of God by honoring our value and importance, and by co-operating with the divine spirit within to bring forth the beautiful harvest of the fruits of the spirit.

We will be an intimate circle of trust of 10-12 women, facilitated by the Daughters of God (Line St. Pierre, Doreen Heyne, Katharina Becker and Carrie Prentice)

Contemplating the metaphor “Dancing with God” as a woman for whom the door of possibilities is open, how do you let the Spirit choreograph your life-dance?

How is this Dance encouraging you to carry the torch of morality, spirituality, and God's love?
