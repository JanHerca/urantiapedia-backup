Sainte-Julie

Hello readers of your journal Réflectivité,

This month, I would like to talk to you about our study group **“The Bridge”**. This study group originated from the idea that the late Guy Vachon had to bring together readers of _The Urantia Book_ at his home, several years ago, for a study of this fifth revelation. Having learned of this study group on the South Shore of Montreal, I joined them for a few years.

As this group had become quite large in terms of participation, it had smaller ones and two subgroups were then formed, one heading towards Montreal, and the other became the group “Les estudiantins”, the group that I started at that time in Saint-Basile-le-Grand. This lasted for a few years, then due to a lack of participants, and following the death of my partner, I put the group into dormancy.

It was in the fall of 2019, if my memory serves me right, and after the death of Guy Vachon, that I decided to resurrect my group by calling on the members of Guy's late group. They joined me with great enthusiasm and renewed energy. As the pandemic had not yet appeared, the meetings took place at my home in Sainte-Julie every Wednesday from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. At that time, there were six of us around the table. Following a unanimous vote and in memory of Guy Vachon, the name of my group changed to perpetuate his memory! It was a moment of great emotion, because we all carried our dear brother in our hearts, and we missed his presence very much!

Our study revolved around different subjects until we decided to study the life of Jesus in order to know how he had managed to reach, around the age of 30, the level of fusion with his Adjuster if that had been possible for him. We knew full well that what he had done could apply to us in particular in order to hope, at the very least, to reach a higher point of collaboration with our own Adjusters. This is how we began the in-depth study of the life of Jesus of Nazareth.

With the year 2020, the pandemic put an end to our in-person meetings at my home. However, thanks to the collaboration of the AUQ, we continued our meetings via Zoom. This new way of holding our meetings allowed new people to join the group over time. For more than two years now, we have been continuing this study. One of our members, Guy Breton, graduated in 2020, certainly continuing this study on the worlds of houses.

Today, the group has ten people divided into the presence of three women and seven men. We continue our study of the master, his life and his teachings with ever more enthusiasm, depth in the understanding of his gospel, daily application of his message in service to others, and above all in a contagious good humor. A big thank you to our heavenly Father for his kindness and the gift of the Adjusters, for the Spirit of Truth of Michael who shows us the way, and for all other spiritual presences facilitating our study!
