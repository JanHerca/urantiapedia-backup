Hello dear readers of your newspaper Réflectivité!

For this month, our president, Gaétan Charland, is taking leave of his usual post, because he and Line are very busy completing their move to Boucherville. We wish them all the courage and energy necessary to carry out this event! As announced in the previous issue, our association will change its postal address. It will be communicated to us very soon!

I have received many favorable comments about your appreciation of the new presentation of our newspaper. Some people like the design and the ease of reading, others the fact of a greater quantity of illustrations embellishing the visual, still others find the published texts of great depth and useful for a better understanding of this fifth epochal revelation, and finally, other complimentary comments on the fun and educational aspect of the game proposed by our brother André Pominville! I thank all these people who took the trouble to send us their appreciations. Since the newspaper team is made up of volunteers, these comments are our pay and constitute for us a revealing indicator of your satisfaction and in which direction we should continue our efforts!

I would like to renew a request already stated previously in another issue. May I ask you to send me an article of your choice for publication in your journal? You are all long-time readers of The Urantia Book. I am certain that you have experienced a great deal of awareness while reading these issues. You have surely had many spiritual experiences that give meaning to your life. It is written that sharing is divine! So, let us be like our Heavenly Father who shares everything he has for his children out of love, and let us share in fraternity, all life experiences that can edify our fellow men.

Even if your writing skills are limited to writing just one article a year, it can benefit many people and stimulate their spirits on the long road to the Father in Paradise. It is good to know the book and its teachings by heart in order to BE as upright as possible, but it is even better to DO something for your brothers and sisters in the love of sharing your knowledge and experiences. By doing this, we are only obeying our divine Father by seeking to be like Him, and then, contributing to actualizing the God of time and space, the Supreme Being, by doing something out of love for all the Father's children. You do not need to be a great writer to publish an article in your newspaper or to compose a text of several pages. Our proofreader will be happy to rework your sentences a little, if necessary, and to correct grammatical errors and typos.7

I am sure you would not like your favorite publication to be written only by your humble servant! Although I do not fear running out of ideas, since our _Urantia Book_ is full of subjects more exciting than the others, the diversity of opinions and personal experiences can only be beneficial to all. The Master told his apostles that he expected from them a spiritual union in a diversity of individual expression. So, let us be prolific as he wished, and I am certain that he will thank us for having reached out to his children when we are in his company, on Salvington, to receive from his hands our credentials for the higher worlds!

Thank you in advance for all your commendable and generous efforts!

To love is to serve!
