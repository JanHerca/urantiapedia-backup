Hello dear students of the _Urantia Book_ revelation,

Have you ever stopped to think about being in relationship with others? In section 4 of booklet 105 alone, the word “relationship” comes up 12 times! Within this booklet alone, it comes up 33 times, and that's without counting the number of times it appears throughout the book. That is to say, the importance of being in relationship is paramount to our Universal Father! Taking into account the hypothesis of successive moments in the expression of the Father, one of the first things he did was to be in relationship with an equal to himself. This is how the Original Son appeared. Then, in this relational union, they desired to activate this creative relationship. This choice resulted in the appearance of the Infinite Spirit. We know the rest, the three of them united in the Paradise Trinity to accomplish their divine purpose.

If the importance of being in relationship was so for Deity, imagine what it is also for us! We have the presence of the Adjuster in us. He is the presence of the Father in Himself. Through our personal relationship with His divine presence, we have the chance to build our soul, thus ensuring our future existence, and the happiness of continuing our discovery of this so loving Father!

If we return to the material basis of what we are, in a sexual relationship between a man and a woman, in addition to the emotional exchange, there is the possibility of co-creating another human being. This is a truly basic relationship, because even animals, without being endowed with a personality, can reproduce. If we move up the register of possible relationships between human beings, we see that a relationship is always relatively creative. As an example, we have the story of artists who have created literary, musical or other works under the influence of some muse. By simply sharing our life experiences, we enrich each other. We should not forget that the sum of all these experiences lived by the multitude of beings populating the cosmos enriches the Supreme Being and gradually works towards its actualization.

There is also another type of relationship of which we are at present unaware, and I have named it the relationship between us and our guardian angel. Our seraphic guardian ceaselessly translates the messages of the Adjuster in order to make the directives of the spirit accessible to our minds.

Another type of relationship with which we have unfortunately lost direct contact lies in the presence of the Sons and God with men. On a normal planet, a Planetary Prince is present with his staff for the religious, social and economic progress of the inhabitants of the planet. Subsequently an Adam and Eve continue the advancement of this civilization in a greater revelation of the truth. Other divine Sons will follow in due time to perfect this relationship between humanity and divinity. Then, one day, a Son of bestowal will come and install after his departure the Spirit of Truth showing the way to the Father.

Our entire adventure, from our home planet to Paradise, will be centered on relationships with others. Even at this high level of existence, a relationship with a Havonian could result in trinitization in the creation of a new being. Looking from one end of the human career ladder to the other; if materially, I can through a relationship co-create another human being, and in a relationship with a Havonian trinitize another being, what creative possibilities does morontia life hold for me? The revelators tell us nothing about this, but I have a hunch that this possibility exists!

What does being a being with personality, a gift from the Universal Father, capable of reproducing himself through the act of being in relationship with other personalities, mean to you? What does being in relationship with your brothers and sisters mean in your personal experience?
