_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

On the night of December 15, 2023, without fanfare, Pierre Routhier, a great among the great, left us for the world of mansions. In collaboration with my colleagues from the study group focused on ***The Urantia Book*** and the two books written by William S. Sadler Jr., of which Pierre Routhier has been a part since its beginnings, we would like to pay a final tribute to the one who was, for all of us, an example to follow!

Indeed, it was in the year 2008 that Pierre Routhier joined us for an in-depth study of William S. Sadler Jr.'s books entitled “_A Study of the Master Universe_” and “_Appendices to a Study of the Master Universe_”. We devoted more than ten years to this project and Pierre was of great help to the group with his in-depth knowledge of the fifth epochal revelation and his most endearing personality. Although Pierre is no longer present among us, following a relapse of cancer in 2019 and weakened by treatments, he was always present almost until the end of the study and since then in our minds. Although having gone through these works, the group still pursues the deep understanding of the concepts bequeathed by the revelators.

A photo of our group dated Sunday, June 14, 2009, shows the fraternal environment that reigned in the garage converted by Alain Nielsen as a study room. We see a Pierre Routhier all smiles, as usual, in the company of the seven participants of this group, three of whom do not appear in the photo, Chantale Chartier, Julien Audet and your humble servant, behind the camera. From left to right, you can see Bertin Perron, the late Yvon Létourneau, partner of Normande Jalbert, Pierre Routhier and Alain Nielsen,

In the company of my partner at the time, Diane Rousseau, now deceased, we had the pleasure of welcoming the whole group for a dinner at home where we shared a good meal, anecdotes, experiences and good jokes as only Pierre knew how to give us! In the photo dated September 2010, we took advantage of the good weather to take a walk in the neighborhood to an artificial lake not far from my home.

Our last meeting with Lise and Pierre took place in Montreal, in the garden on Gouin Boulevard, the location of their last known home, for a picnic. This last photo is from July 2016. We were all seated for dinner near the river (see next page). For my part, in my memory, this is the last time I saw Lise and Pierre alive.

## Testimony of Julien Audet

I know that his soul is free from his body. I am happy for him, for a new morontia adventure awaits him in his soul and personality with his Divine Spirit in the Supreme.

One of Pierre's qualities, assisted by his wife, is his resilience in spreading the revelation. A fervent believer, a pioneer of the fifth revelation in Quebec, a true brother in the faith!

## Testimony of Bertin Perron

Pierre always had the right word to make us laugh. He was the pillar of the Urantian movement in Quebec. Without him, little would have happened to bring Quebec readers together.

## Testimony of Chantale Chartier

I met Pierre in 1993, it was he who sold me my first _Urantia Book_.

I went to see his lectures at the “_Commensal_”, which inspired my spiritual journey.

For me, at the time, Pierre was a great reader and researcher of the _Urantia Book_. I could not have imagined that one day we would study together “_The Study of the Master Universe_” and their _Appendices_. It was the discovery of a man of great humility, wisdom and greatness of soul. Of a man who knew how to remain master and student at the same time, despite his great knowledge. Pierre, you are an example of perseverance, open-mindedness and love.

Thank you Pierre,

Have a good trip into the universe!

## Testimony of Alain Nielsen

Rock,

I am because you are!!!

Together we have climbed conceptual mountains of beauty, truth and goodness.

With you, my friend, I was able to touch the glory of the grandeur of God's plans.
You directed the light of the 5th Epochal Revelation like a beacon in order to guide your brothers in spirit to safety.

Your spiritual heritage is inestimable. Its cosmic value rests on the experience of ascending to God the Father and daring to try to be like Him.

Peter, thank you.

Thank you for being!!!

## My testimony

I admired Pierre for his tenacity and his loyalty to the Urantian movement in Quebec. In addition to a host of unifying activities, Pierre, assisted by Lise Charbonneau, published Réflectivité for several years. Today, I am proudly responsible, as editor, for the survival of this monthly within a formidable team, which gives a voice to all the lovers of this extraordinary revelation. I do not think I am wrong in saying on behalf of all the readers of Quebec that without the presence of Pierre Routhier at the helm of the Urantian movement, we would not be here today. Pierre, I miss you, and I have faith in the idea that we will meet again, one of these days, on the world of houses! Hello to you, my brother in spirit!
