The administrator of the Urantiapedia Website put online, last June, a host of articles in French made from a translation of English publications on the subject of the _Urantia Book_. Here is the text published on the Urantiapedia Website of the list of these publications and the links to read them in French:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

- [Fellowship Herald](/en/index/articles_herald), from the Fellowship. In addition to adding this publication in French, we have also added the latest available issues, translated where necessary. This publication is now available in its entirety in English, Spanish and French.
- The Fellowship's other publications: [The Urantian](/en/index/articles_the_urantian), [Mighty Messenger](/en/index/articles_mighty_messenger), and [Study Group Herald](/en/index/articles_study_group_herald), are now fully online and available in English, Spanish and French.
- [Urantian News](/en/index/articles_uf_urantian), the former print publication of Urantia Foundation, is also downloaded and available in English, Spanish and French.

Here is what Jan Herca wrote about translations of Urantia articles to be posted on Urantiapedia:

> My intention with Urantiapedia is to compile every publication that has ever existed about Urantia. A wonderful job is already underway with a project called the [Urantia Book Historical Society](https://ubhs.hosted-by-files.com/http/DocTypesIndex.html). I use a lot of material from that project. I also use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), which allows me to find articles and documents whose links are broken or no longer available.
> 
> And I don't want to stop there. I also intend to put online all the content of certain websites, associations or individuals, where many interesting articles and content are shared.
> 
> To simplify: I want to create a website that brings everything together, so that a reader can easily find any content.
> 
> It's going to be a lot of work, because it's not just copy and paste. When I upload something, I try to organize it, give it a unified format, index it, put tags on it to make it easier to search... Well, you can imagine how much work that is.
> 
> The good news is that I have some tools that help me go fast. Let's say I have my tricks. Even so, it's still a lot of work.
> 
> Reflectivity magazine is about to go live, that will probably be next as soon as I'm done with the whole IUA thing (oh, and a book by David Kantor on the history of the Urantia movement).
> 
> You know: the harvest is abundant and the workers are few. But the work is super edifying and exciting! I learn a lot every day! And that fills me with joy!
> 
> See you soon!

Happy reading
