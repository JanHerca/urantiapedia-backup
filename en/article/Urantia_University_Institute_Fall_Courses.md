## The Progress Project

_A new experiential course in spiritual growth led by Angie Thurston and Aprilhelen Morgan._

## Special Online Orientation Session

Sunday, Sept 27, 2020
11:00 am-12:30 pm EDT (UTC-4)

Participants who are interested in taking the 12-week online course must attend the Orientation session (or watch a recording of it) prior to being admitted to the course.

https://urantiauniversity.org/page-1804225 

The purpose of the **Progress Project Course** is to deepen our personal relationships with God, share our inner lives with each other, and support each other in spiritual goals through intentional relationships. It takes its name from an initiative that was developed by Urantia Book readers as a network of small groups focused on personal spiritual growth. Over 12 weeks, the class will meet for 90 minutes a week in a live Zoom session, focusing on the arc of spiritual growth from inner connection to outer expression. Each class period will include time for worshipful communion, instruction from Angie and Aprilhelen, and breakout groups for Urantia Book study and personal reflection on the week's theme.

When spiritual seekers first encounter _The Urantia Book_, they are usually intrigued but often overwhelmed by its size and complexity and all the strange new terms and concepts. After initial attempts, many of them give up trying to read it. Without a little help, it is difficult for them to cross the threshold into a serious study of the text. And so they may never experience the joys and spiritual transformation that come from fully exploring this revelation.

Urantia University Institute (UUI) has developed a **New Reader Course**, in cooperation with the Urantia Book Fellowship Education Committee, to help such fledgling readers cross the initial threshold, equipping them to comfortably begin a full exploration of the text and to participate in the growing Urantia movement.

## A Way of Life in the Family of God: A Course in Spiritual Formation

Weekly on Sundays, from September 27 to November 29, 2020

The 10-week online **Course in Spiritual Formation** introduces participants to a new and higher way of living. The purpose of the Course is to help us mobilize our faith - allowing the Spirit to more fully transform us — so that we can truly begin to live in spiritual family relationship, with God as our heavenly Parent and all human beings as our spiritual sisters and brothers.

Spiritual Formation is a process wherein we clarify, organize and integrate the central spiritual truths in our lives (the great gifts, the “exceedingly great and precious promises of God”) so that, by the exercise of “our faith, and the spirit's transformation,” we can begin increasingly to live out these truths, and eventually embody them and become them.

## The UUI Cafe

We invite you to the online UUI Café - open six days a week at various times - where our spiritual brothers and sisters can hang out and have soul-growing conversations based on the wisdom of the Urantia teachings and the world's great spiritual traditions.

The UUI Café operates as a Zoom meeting each weekday and often on Saturdays at a different time each day to accommodate various time zones and schedules as best we can.

Each day of the week has a different focus or theme from _The Urantia Book_. Often the theme is connected to how we are handling the current world and national crises from a spiritually illuminated point of view.

The sessions are moderated by members of the UUI staff. We use passages from _The Urantia Book_ for conversation starters, and pause for moments of focused worship now and then.
