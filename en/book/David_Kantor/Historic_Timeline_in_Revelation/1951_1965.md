## 1951

November 22 — Contact Commissioners receive instructions regarding the book and the role of Urantia Foundation [See excerpt from this document](/en/article/Fellowship/Instructions_Purportedly_Received_By_Contact_Commissioners)

## 1952

August 21 — Plan for the organization of Urantia Brotherhood approved in communique to contact commissioners. [See excerpt from this document](/en/article/Fellowship/Instructions_Purportedly_Received_By_Contact_Commissioners) Note: Based on the contents of this document as well as the one above dated November 22, 1951, it is quite clear that, barring any additional contact from the Midwayer Commission, all matters related to the publication of the book were to be executed in accordance with the best judgment of the trustees of Urantia Foundation. _Beyond this, there are no specific instructions_. In a letter to Jacques Weiss in 1970, Emma Christensen, replying to comments Weiss made about continuing contacts, said, “I am sure you know that no one, and I mean, <ins>no one</ins>, [underlines appear in original] is receiving any information from the Commission whch sponsored the Urantia Book. I am sure this Commission will in due time provide any additional information if such is deemed necessary. I speak authoritatively on this subject, so do not be misled by such claims as you report.”

Furthermore, in 1994, Urantia Foundation President, Richard Keeler, in a deposition taken under oath, testified that there had been no further communications.

## 1954

Information from an apocryphal source indicates that the seraphim of progress and the seraphim of the churches each sought authority to direct the revelation following publication. This same source indicates that in the end, the planetary government agreed to place the direction of the revelation under the seraphim of the churches for the first one hundred years, after which it would be placed under the direction of the seraphim of progress. For additional insight into this possible conflict, note the comment at [UB 134:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_8)

Last message received from revelators — the go-ahead for publication. Along with this message was the comment, “You are now on your own” and an indication that all celestial personalities remaining on the planet as well as resident personalities were required to take a vow of silence regarding any further communications related to the revelation. The book was printed in sixteen page signatures, run twice through the press for front and back impressions.

## 1955

In addition to being the first reader group to form independently of the Chicago office and the members of the former Forum, this was also the first reader group to establish a church — “The New Age Christian Church” with B. Salyer as the minister.[^5]  [See “The Urantia Book Comes to Oklahoma City”, by Helen Butler. Also a testimonial by B. M. Salyer](/en/article/Helen_Butler/The_Urantia_Book_Comes_to_Oklahoma_City)

March 7 — Bill Sadler meets with Oklahoma City readers to discuss becoming a Society.[^5]

Editor's note: Bill Sadler became good friends with Oklahoma oilman Clyde Goodman and his Administrative Assistant, Berkeley Elliott. Clyde and Berkeley became early devotees of the book and Bill began to make trips to Oklahoma City to lead study groups for the growing readership there. The folks back at Chicago soon became suspicious that Bill was trying to utilize the Oklahoma City readers as a base for building his own movement. From all available evidence, this suspicion was completely unfounded, but it exemplified the attitude with which the Chicago office generally viewed spontaneous developments in the field which they had not initiated and over which they had little or no control.

[Picture of the fraternity brothers serenading Christy at Family of God Foundation headquarters, 1980]

Editor's note: These four gentlemen formed an alliance with Christy and Doc Sadler and profoundly influenced the direction of social and legal development within the movement over the next forty years—two of them apparently continue to do so at the time of this writing (1997). Christy told me in a private conversation that by the early 1960's, she and Dr. Sadler were getting concerned about the lack of capable young people coming into the movement—they saw the arrival of these gentlemen as an answer to their prayers. Referring to this group of four, she said, “When Poppy and I saw them, we weren't going to let them get away.” She subsequently frequently referred to them as, “My boys.” Within ten years this group was showing formidible leadership potentials, with Vern Grimsley's charismatic spiritual presence, multi-millionaire Richard Keeler's financing, Martin Myers' legal education, and Hoite Caston's business and legal experience in the entertainment industry.
