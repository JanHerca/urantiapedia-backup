April 28 — Urantia Foundation approves second printing of the Jacques Weiss translation in three volumes, including footnotes, a pocket inside the front cover containing maps and diagrams of the cosmos, and Bible references added by Weiss. Dr. Sadler provided the approval with the simple condition that Weiss note in the book that these were additions made by the translator and were not part of the original text.

July — Jacques Weiss publishes “The Origin of The Urantia Book” [See Jacques Weiss' history](/en/article/Jacques_Weiss/The_origin_of_The_Urantia_Book)

Family of God Foundation established as a California Non-profit Corporation

August — Edith Cook finds an error in the diagrams Weiss included with the French text. Weiss had printed extra diagrams and sent them to Urantia Foundation as Christmas cards. Weiss had shown dark gravity bodies as existing in unpervaded space as well as in pervaded space. Edith pointed out that there was, according to The Urantia Book, only one belt of dark gravity bodies and that this was in pervaded space. Edith considers this to be a “major error” and reports to the trustees that “His concept would change our whole idea of the shape of the master universe.” She further comments that she sees these maps as misrepresenting the teachings of The Urantia Book.

August 25 — Jacques Weiss meets with trustees in Chicago during which time the error on his diagram is reviewed. Weiss finally gave up in frustration and said he was not going to redo the maps at this point, that he would use up the ones he had, and perhaps would take up the matter at a later time.

November 9 — Jacques Weiss expresses frustration with what he sees as Urantia Foundation's hyper-vigilant concern about the spread of the revelation. Excerpt from his letter to the trustees: “Before 1955, the Forum, who held the manuscript, was centered on the waiting aspect. Several members believed that the Book would not even be published during their lifetime. Then the Hierarchy judged that the situation had matured and the time had come. They gave the green light for the publication with instructions to go slow, even very slow for the beginning. You have remained ever since in that position of first gear, without any further contact with the Hierarchy. Now they judge that the time has come to pass in second gear, not in high. But have you asked them? Obviously no. On the French side, we have constantly been helped by guardian angels and other entities who suggested and approved the passing in second gear, and furnished the corresponding opportunities. You have witnessed the results. We believe in their guidance and follow it, looking more lightly at the legal viewpoint since a spiritual, moral, mental and physical agreement exists between us.”

March 1 — Second printing of The Urantia Book — 10,000 copies[^3]

Martin Myers moves in to 533 Diversey Parkway.[^4]

Editor's note: Martin took up residence at 533 Diversey Parkway and became a faithful companion and caretaker for both Dr. Sadler and Emma Christensen during their declining years. It seems unfortunate that Martin's long dedication to this difficult and challenging service — significantly easing the transition of these last two members of the contact commission to the mansion worlds — has been so largely obscured by his political misfortunes of more recent years.

April 26 — Death of Dr. William S. Sadler[^5]

According to Meredith Sprunger: “On Friday evening he seemed to understand that his earthly life was about to close. With mental clarity he gave a farewell talk to those who were close to him, in which he included the following words: ”This world is very real, but the next one is much more real. It is easy to leave the pains of this world for the pleasures of the next. And I am going to enjoy every moment of it. The transition from this world to the next is very easy. There is no pain. I am very conscious of everything that is going on. I could go on visiting with you for hours, but it would be no use. The chapter is closed. The last lines have been written; the book is finished.“ Then, turning to Christy, he said, “And now Christy I pass the responsibilities of Urantia on to you. I know you will do well for you have always been a good soldier. When you leave you will pass the torch to the younger members. I'll tell them hello up there for you.” [See “Memorial Service for Dr. William S. Sadler”](/en/article/Fellowship/Memorial_Service_for_Dr_William_S_Sadler) [See entry for Dr. Sadler in “National Cyclopedia of American Biography”](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/sadler_cyclopedia_biography.pdf)

The original plates were only good for approximately 30,000 impressions on India Paper. (The 1st printing used such paper, but subsequent printings used a synthetic thin paper).

April 24 — Jacques Weiss, ready to proceed with a reprinting of Volume II for purposes of replacing the 2,000 copies damaged in 1969, is informed by Urantia Foundation that they are not likely to authorize him to proceed with this printing. On May 11, Weiss placed an order with a Paris printshop to begin a third printing of Volume II. He claimed that this printing was needed to replace 2,000 copies of Volume II of the second printing which had been damaged. However, he ordered 5,500 copies (supposedly due to economies of scale related to printing costs). Urantia Foundation declared this a contractual violation and used the opportunity to sue Weiss, thereby gaining control of the French text.

July 3 — Bob Burton writes letter to Jacques Weiss explaining why Urantia Foundation does not have a valid copyright in _The Urantia Book_. He also indicates that he is trying to get Urantia Foundation to evaluate his newly completed Spanish translation. [See Burton's letter to Weiss](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/burton_weiss070372.pdf)

Explusion of Robert Burton from Urantia organizations. The Executive Committee of Urantia Brotherhood led by Alvin Kulieke brough formal charges against Robert Burton and sought his expulsion from Urantia Brotherhood. Among other things, he was charged with preaching “the doctrines of the Lucifer Manifesto of unbridled liberty, and disrespect of, and rebellion against, rightfully constituted leadership . . .”  Bob had grown impatient with Urantia Foundation's inability to mobilize resources for a Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_. He reportedly hired a translator in Mexico and had a Spanish translation completed. Urantia Foundation apparently took possession of this manuscript but it was never published. Urantia Foundation began work on an “official” Spanish translation some ten years later.

- [See report of events at hearing](/en/article/Fellowship/Regarding_the_Expelling_of_Mr_Robert_Burton)   Robert Burton subsequently referred to himself as “the first excommunicated reformer of the 533 Urantia Institution.” In 1973 he wrote to President Paul Snider regarding a review of his status.

November 11 — Urantia Foundation notifies selected readers that lawsuit against Jacques Weiss is being initiated. [See copy of Urantia Foundation lawsuit announcement](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/weiss_suit_notice110773.pdf) This lawsuit essentially halted sales to French-speaking readers. The price of underground photocopied editions soared to over $200.00 per copy in France, supplied to readers through the efforts of Andre Heisse. Heisse and his co-workers evaded apprehension by agents of Urantia Foundation by frequently moving their equipment and generally conducting their operation as did the Resistance propagandists during World War II.

January 11—Paul Snider, President of Urantia Brotherhood and Tom Kendall, President of Urantia Foundation meet with Oklahoma City readers in an attempt to calm reactions to Urantia Foundation's Confirmatory Agreement which had been signed by Paul Snider as President of the Brotherhood, and now needed the ratification of the Societies.

[See copy of correspondence](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/grimsley_snider011675.pdf)  Vern Grimsley's paranoia eventually led to his own psychological instability and the collapse of his organization, The Family of God Foundation. He was still advising Urantia Foundation trustees as recently as 1999.

April 4-6 — Southern California conference sponsored by First Urantia Society of Los Angeles.

April 16 — Emma Christensen confides to Vern Grimsley that Urantia Foundation has failed to register their name and marks in many foreign countries and seeks his help to exploit international contacts resulting from Vern's radio broadcasts as a means of obtaining proper registration and usage. The plan is to let Urantia Brotherhood Corporation do the mailing for Grimsley so that Urantia Foundatino can show it's marks as in use in the target country.[See copy of correspondence](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/christy_grimsley041675.pdf)

June 6 — Urantia Foundation and Urantia Brotherhood sign Confirmatory Sales Agreement [See Confirmatory Sales Agreement](/en/article/Fellowship/Confirmatory_Sales_Agreement)

Paul Snider, who signed the agreements for the Brotherhood, later declared that he had signed them under false pretenses because he was told at the time that the reason was to protect the book when, as it turned out, Martin Myers and the attorneys had cooked up a mechanism to leverage control of the organizations. Paul, in effect, declared his signature morally, if not legally, null and void.[^5] [See letter of re-evaluation which Paul Snider wrote as President of the Glenview Society in 1990](/en/article/Fellowship/Letter_to_Urantia_Foundation_from_Glenview)

Urantia Foundation sues Bob Burton for copyright infringement.[^3]

Bob Burton gave away photocopies of The Urmia Lectures and also mailed copies of Paper 72 — Government on a Neighboring Planet — to all the members of the U.S. Congress. He is also rumored to have given a copy of The Urantia Book to President Kennedy. Bob had acquired a manuscript for the first Spanish translation of the book which had been done by Marvin and Betty Tackett. Urantia Foundation ended up in possession of the manuscript and effectively prevented publication. Several sources have told me that the Trustees had some of the translated papers evaluated and as a result felt that it was a poor quality translation. It had apparently been done by a non-reader strictly on a pay-for-service basis. A Spanish translation remained unavailable until one was produced under Urantia Foundation control some eighteen years later in 1993.

February 8 — San Francisco Bay Area Urantia Society installed (Urantia Brotherhood)[^2]

There were strong political forces at play that brought about the chartering of the San Francisco Society. Vern Grimsley had maintained virtual control over Bay Area politics through his Family of God Foundation. He had never wanted a Urantia Society in which members of his Foundation would be involved because he wanted to maintain the appearance of being a separate politically independent organization. But with a triennial delegate assembly immediately on the horizon and Society ratification of the Foundation's confirmatory agreement a major burning issue, Urantia Foundation needed to muster as much support as possible. It was known that any delegate from Vern's organization could be counted on to vote for ratification so the entire process was rushed through the appropriate formalities. This in spite of the fact that a short time previous to this, Urantia Foundation, through its representatives on the Council and the Brotherhood Executive Committee, had pushed through a moratorium on the chartering of any more societies until the controversy over the confirmatory agreement was settled. This moratorium was then used to suspend the chartering process for the Dallas group (which had applied prior to the Bay Area group) because it was assumed that their vote would be against ratification. In spite of these machinations, the Societies failed to ratify the agreement.3

February — Richard Prince appointed Field Representative of Urantia Brotherhood.

March 31 — With another major conference on the horizon outside the direct control of Chicago, (this one sponsored by the Oklahoma Society — long viewed as a center of sedition by the Chicago office) Urantia Foundation issues strict guidelines regarding what is permissible at any conference of readers regarding how quotes may be used from the book, as well as the use of the name “Urantia” and the concentric circles symbol on any materials used in conjunction with the conference.

First meeting of study group in Colombia (Bogotá)

Urantia Foundation submits “Assignment Agreement” to the Executive Committee of Urantia Brotherhood with pressure to sign. This agreement required Urantia Brotherhood to sell all rights it had acquired during its 23 year use of the name “Urantia” and the concentric circles symbol to Urantia Foundation for $1.00. [See: Urantia Foundation's “Assignment Agreement”]()

June 25-27 — Urantia International Forum of Urantia Brotherhood held at Lake Eufaula, Oklahoma, followed by major study seminar program.

August — Problems erupt related to Urantia Foundation's attempts to control the drawings published as “An Artist's Conception of the Master Universe”. Jacques Weiss maintained that Jacques Dupont had created the maps as a “work for hire.” Dupont maintained that Weiss had stolen the maps from him. Weiss had apparently given them to a Swiss artist for touch-up and improvements. Urantia Foundation considered Weiss to be creating the maps as a “work for hire” and that Weiss had contracted this work out to Dupont and the Swiss artist, still as “works for hire” for purposes of Foundation retention of control. The Foundation maintained that they owned the drawings because Weiss was an “agent” of Urantia Foundation and the drawings had to receive Foundation approval before printing, thereby clearly making Urantia Foundation the owner of all rights in the drawings.

October 2 — Wenatchee, Washington (USA) Regional Conference

November — Florida Regional Conference, Lakeland, Florida

November 1 — Urantia Foundation issues final directives to Oklahoma Society regarding the use of marks, etc. [See Tom Kendall's letter to Berkeley Elliott](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/originals/kendall_berk110176_1.pdf)

November 23 — Urantia Foundation files to register the stylized word “Urantia” as a collective membership mark to indicate “membership in Urantia Brotherhood.”

Duane Faw comments: Since Urantia Foundation was not a membership organization it could not file on its own behalf, therefore it had to ride piggy-back on the Brotherhood. It bought for $1.00 whatever interest the Brotherhood had developed in a membership organization and applied as “successors-in-title.” It alleged Urantia Brotherhood was “a related company” which was partly true but inadequate to justify registration, therefore the application was amended to read “a social and fraternal organization” and “members of a related association, namely Urantia Brotherhood.”' (True.) It also swore “..and the use of the mark to indicate membership in said related company (association) is supervised and controlled by Applicant...” which was patently false. There is nothing in the Declaration of Trust or the Brotherhood Constitution authorizing such a relationship.

Late 1976 — Harold Sherman, a member of the Forum, publishes a book titled, “How to Know What to Believe” containing a chapter called, “Pipeline to God.” This is Sherman's account of a conversation with Dr. Sadler in which the way in which The Urantia Book came into being was discussed. Sherman also provides details concerning his disagreement with Dr. Sadler regarding the inclusion of material about psychic and paranormal phenomena in the Urantia Papers.

- 1987 — Berkeley Elliott and Dan Massey ultimately completed a full revision of the script, recorded it, and presented it at the 1987 General Conference in Brunswick, Maine. It was shown about 6-8 times during the conference, always to a substantial audience. Subsequent to this, Berkeley made further revisions in the show and had it transferred to video tape. The Brotherhood circulated this video tape privately to interested groups and intended to develop an official version that could actually be published (and sold). Among the obstacles to this was the fact that many of the visuals which had been used had simply been photographed from books and were protected by copyrights. Berkeley undertook to fix this aspect of the production. However, about the time the product was ready to go, the breakup with Foundation occurred rendering significant portions of the presentation obsolete.
