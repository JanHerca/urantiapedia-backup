May 2 — Death of Emma Christensen, the last living contact commissioner

Editor's note: The death of Emma Christensen precipitated a power struggle between Martin Myers and Vern Grimsley for influence amongst the readership. Vern used his charismatic appeal to the readership as his primary tool. Martin used his knowledge of the legal system. The end result was a disaster. Vern's organization was completely destroyed in the process and the credibility of Martin's Urantia Foundation was seriously damaged — perhaps permanently. Each of these dedicated men was reduced to the status of pariah amongst most of the established readership. At that time, the remaining two of the original four “Christy's Boys”, Richard Keeler and Hoite Caston, took over the effort to control the development of the rapidly emerging readership as well as the attempted salvage of Urantia Foundation.

August 19-21 — Center for Urantia Book Synergy — CUBS — sponsors “The Art of Living” conference in Santa Barbara, California — over 300 participants from 22 states and Canada.

Sek Seklemian, a longtime business associate of Clyde Bedell and founding member of CUBS, was extremely upset by Urantia Foundation's demands that all printed materials to be used in conjunction with the conference as well as all presentations, had to be approved by them in advance. The night after the conference, according to an eyewitness in Sek's home, Sek said he was so upset that he was going to change his will — he had bequeathed $100,000 to Urantia Foundation. Sek collapsed later that evening and died shortly thereafter without changing his will. Urantia Foundation financial reports of subsequent years lend support to the conclusion that Urantia Foundation used Sek's bequest to fund their lawsuit against CUBS shortly after his estate was finally settled.[3]

August — First Doctoral Dissertation about The Urantia Book submitted; Jacques Rheaume's “An Analysis of a Revealed Text: The Urantia Book”

September — Executive Committe Letter outlining organizational job descriptions, comments on mass media promotion of The Urantia Book, report on the Boulder School. [See September 1983 Executive Committee Letter](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/newsletters/doc619.htm#boulder)

October 6 — Vern Grimsley announces he has received a “message” from superhuman sources warning that World War III is imminent, converts Family of God Foundation 1.5 million dollar commodity account (managed by Richard Keeler) into gold coins and bullion, stashing it at his California seminary. Foundation and Brotherhood leaders immediately fly to California to hear details directly from Vern. An effort to convince Urantia Foundation and Urantia Brotherhood to move all their records and documents to the Clayton seminary for safekeeping begins.

Editor's note: Up until this time, all of Vern Grimsley's alleged “messages” had been in direct support of existing Urantia Foundation policies and had represented positions on the controversial advertising issue — “don't split up the book,” “the time has not yet come to advertise the book.” With his change to an apocalyptic message, his support within the Foundation and the Brotherhood quickly evaporated. It should be noted that during the years of Emma Christensen's influence on the organizations, it was apparently not uncommon for her to arrive on the scene of a policy dispute claiming “we were told by the Midwayers that...” regarding the matter at hand. This would usually be sufficient to end any further discussion. In at least one instance — the dispute over the French translation with Jacques Weiss in November of 1980 — she claimed to have been given a new “message.” Again, her claim was considered sufficient to determine policy. It is likely that Emma Christensen was merely following the same social management strategy employed by Dr. Sadler in his management of the Forum and the Seventy—the only management strategy with which she had any experiece. Vern's initial “messages” may have simply been a continuation of this means of attempting to manage the readership. The added twist was that implicit in his having received such “messages” was a superhuman endorsement of him as replacement for Emma Christensen — the person receiving superhuman guidance related to policy development. This was perhaps the most audacious—and dangerous—personal reach for power the movement has yet seen. In spite of the lessons learned in the Grimsley affair—particularly the margin of safety acquired by bringing the wisdom of a large number of experienced readers to bear on the evaluation of critical issues—to this day (1997) Urantia Foundation has continued the strategy of implying superhuman endorsement of their policies in an effort to create unquestioning compliance.

March 25 — World War III fails to occur as predicted by Family of God Foundation.

Family of God Foundation disintegrates. World-wide syndicated broadcasting enterprise collapses. Vern Grimsley fails in attempt to sue the The Congregation of the Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for real estate fraud, loses his seminary property in California.21

Editor's note: Vern Grimsley was perhaps the most charismatic and articulate individual to appear on the readership scene up to the time of this writing (1997). He was an excellent writer and a highly skilled orator who could move large audiences, and the only one of the original four “Christy's Boys” to show any significant degree of spiritual leadership potential. His inability to rehabilitate himself after the failure of his war predictions and the subsequent collapse of his broadcasting empire and his “Spiritual Renaissance Institute” appears to be an unfortunate loss to the cause of the revelation. [See “The Galilean” by Vern Grimsley](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/readers/galilean.htm)

May 3-5 — Kansas City regional conference; “Self-Mastery.”

Urantia Brotherhood proposes test marketing study for The Urantia Book

July 28—Urantia Foundation threatens to revoke the Brotherhood's right to use the concentric circles symbol and the name “Urantia” as well as its freedom to sell books if it carries out a marketing study. Urantia Foundation stresses its desire for a “de-emphasis of book sales.”

[See Urantia Foundation's July 27 response to Brotherhood President's annual report](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc105.htm)

[See Urantia Foundation's July 28 threat regarding retribution if any marketing studies are undertaken](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc106.htm)

Editor's note: It is instructive to read the above two documents, dated 24 hours apart, in sequence. The second document represented something of a political watershed in that it publicly confirmed what had long been suspected—that Urantia Foundation intended to use their newly acquired rights to the name “Urantia” and the concentric circles symbol (as a result of trademark registrations and the licensing and confirmatory agreements) to manipulate the policy making functions of the supposedly independent Urantia Brotherhood.

[See C.U.B.S. plea to Urantia Foundation requesting discussion rather than lawsuit](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/cubs_letter061388.htm)

Note: Case was eventually settled out of court with CUBS retaining the right to use the name “Urantia.”

## 1989

Urantia Foundation refuses to allow public access to their financial records.3

February—Urantia Brotherhood President submits confidential memo to Trustees of Urantia Foundation expressing concern about the manner in which Martin Myers is manipulating Urantia organizations. [See Memo from Urantia Brotherhood of February 1, 1989](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc161.htm)

Editor's note: An ad hoc committee of Urantia Foundation trustees apparently found merit in the complaints and drew up a plan for reorganization of leadership policies. This plan was approved by the Trustees prior to Martin's re-election as President. Martin's overwhelmingly negative reaction to this plan was a contributing factor to the subsequent resignation of three Trustees.

Martin Myers resigns from his job as Vice President of a Chicago bank to work full time for Urantia Foundation.24

May 19-21 — Heart of America Urantia Society regional conference; “Spiritual Springtime.”

June — Urantia Society in Finland installed.24

Rumors abound that Urantia Foundation is on the verge of bankruptcy and that the perpetual printing fund as well as the Spanish translation fund have been raided to cover legal expenses.

Richard Keeler elected Trustee of Urantia Foundation.

Urantia Foundation rumored to be saved from financial disaster by a single contribution estimated at close to two million dollars.

July 21 — Urantia Brotherhood submits letter to Urantia Foundation requesting the resignation of Martin Myers. [See Urantia Brotherhood letter of July 21, 1989](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc108.htm)   [See Urantia Foundation's letter of response, August 24, 1989](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc107.htm)

October 17 — Urantia Brotherhood informs Urantia Foundation Trustees it will no longer solicit funds for Urantia Foundation due to the Foundation's refusal to allow the Brotherhood Finance Committee to review Foundation financial records.

October 30 — (Hallowe'en) Urantia Foundation disenfranchises Urantia Brotherhood Corporation as sales and distribution agent for The Urantia Book, de-licenses Urantia Brotherhood and forbids the use of the name “Urantia,” “Urantian,” or the concentric circles symbol; terminates Urantia Brotherhood's lease of office space at 533 Diversey Parkway.

[See picture of the banner of the first Triennial Delegate Assembly](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/firsttri.htm)

January 3 — Death of Henry Begemann, translator of the Dutch edition of the text and long-time organizer and leader of European readership. [See: Goodbye Message from French Readers](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc055.htm)

April 1 — Representatives of Urantia Foundation meet with Society representatives in New York regarding the de-licensing of Urantia Brotherhood. The Brotherhood representatives put forth the suggestion that an attempt be made to put the disagreement before a conciliating commission. The Foundation responds that conciliation is only relevant to disputes between equals. According to the Foundation, since the Brotherhood is a wholly subservient creation of the Foundation, the concept of conciliation is irrelevant to the dispute. A Foundation representative maintains that the Foundation is in effect a Sovereign Power in this dispute and that it would be inappropriate for the trustees to subject the direction of their enterprise to the whims of an external conciliating commission.22

April — Urantia Foundation publishes a massive “Special Report” detailing its disenfranchisement of Urantia Brotherhood, mailing copies to some 6,000 persons.[3] [See Urantia Foundation's “Special Report”](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/doc214.htm)

Editor's note: The fact that this report contained obvious distortions of truth and was mailed to Urantia Foundation's entire mailing list of 6,000 readers further aggravated the situation.

Editor's note: In the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s, with movement leadership embroiled in controversial legal disputes related to copyright and trademark issues, a variety of small secondary groups developed in North America and Canada as readers made attempts to form communities independent of internal political conflicts. In a series of events remarkably reminiscent of the Montanists of the second century, numerous individuals claimed to be getting personal “messages” or channeling additional papers from the revelators of the Urantia Book. In spite of The Urantia Book's bright forecast of human and planetary destiny, the prophecies and “messages” of many of these individuals, such as Joe Pope with his “Elijah Ministry” in Canada and Tony Delevin who proclaimed himself “Gabriel of Sedona” in Arizona, took on decidedly apocalyptic overtones. [See “An Evening with Gabriel of Sedona”] Channelers in different parts of the country claimed to be in touch with various celestial personalities mentioned in The Urantia Book. Established Study Groups and Societies re-evaluated their objectives and roles in the larger organizations, many of them re-focusing on local activities. Metaphysical confusion, self-styled prophets and charlatans in the fringes, along with general disenchantment with the “official” organizations in the mainstream seemed to characterize much of the readership.14 (Note: The original text of the Urantia Book was not “channeled” — see “How the Urantia Book Came Into Existence” by Bill Sadler or “A History of the Urantia Movement” by Dr. William S. Sadler. Each of these writers was a member of the “contact commission” and had extensive personal experience with the phenomenon involved.)

Urantia Foundation increasingly refusing to sell books to individuals who are not supportive of Foundation policies or who are suspected of reselling books at subsidized prices in order to make it more affordable. Records indicate that this practice went back at least as far as 1971.

## 1992

Martin Myers dismissed as Trustee of Urantia Foundation3

Editor's note: The process whereby a Trustee is removed from office is rather long and drawn out. By all accounts, this was a grueling ordeal for the Trustees, two of whom were long-time personal friends of Martin's. Martin subsequently sued Urantia Foundation for reinstatement. Martin Myers was replaced by Philip Rolnick who was put in charge of the Foundation's legal affairs. Philip appears to have continued Martin's policy of exploiting all available legal options to control the use of the name “Urantia” and the concentric circles symbol. He resigned shortly after the Foundation's aborted attempt to bring suit against the Fellowship in 1996.

Urantia Foundation publishes “El Libro De Urantia” — Spanish language edition of The Urantia Book; 5,000 copies6 [Picture of El Libro De Urantia translation team](https://archive.urantiabook.org/archive/history/spangrup.htm)

Editor's note: There appear to have been substantial political conflicts which interfered with the orderly production of this translation. The translation team worked with Euramerica, Inc., a professional translation house. Papers were checked by Spanish readers when they were complete. When the book itself was complete, proofed and ready to go, Urantia Foundation trustees shipped the manuscript off to one of their representatives in Finland with instructions to proof the formatting. This individual had a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish and proceeded to add hyphenation to words in odd places, change the gender of words — hundreds of “corrections” were reportedly made. The text was then shipped off to the printer with no further checking or proofing. The result was “El Libro de Urantia” of which one scholar has stated, “I consider the current Spanish translation quite faulty syntactically and semantically/lexically. I really doubt that any Spanish scholar —not knowing English— could do any serious research on such a text.”
