## Bio

**Halbert Katzen** J.D. M.B.A (1962), is a long time reader of _The Urantia Book_ that has spent many years dedicated to create a research project called [UB The News](https://ubannotated.com/ubthenews/reports_list/). His purpose has been to test the science claims of _The Urantia Book_ against the latest scientific discoveries, to see for himself the extent to which many of the scientific community's claims have conformed to the book's claims compared with the time when it was published in 1955.
