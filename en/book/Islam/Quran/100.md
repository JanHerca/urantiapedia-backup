<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the snorting courses,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Striking sparks of fire
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And scouring to the raid at dawn,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Then, therewith, with their trail of dust,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Cleaving, as one, the centre (of the foe),
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Lo! man is an ingrate unto his Lord
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And lo! he is a witness unto that;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And lo! in the love of wealth he is violent.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Knoweth he not that, when the contents of the graves are poured forth
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And the secrets of the breasts are made known,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  On that day will their Lord be perfectly informed concerning them.
