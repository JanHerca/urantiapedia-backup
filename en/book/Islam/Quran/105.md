<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant ?
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Did He not bring their stratagem to naught,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And send against them swarms of flying creatures,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Which pelted them with stones of baked clay,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle) ?
