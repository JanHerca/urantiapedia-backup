<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the fig and the olive,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  By Mount Sinai,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And by this land made safe;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Surely We created man of the best stature
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Then we reduced him to the lowest of the low,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Save those who believe and do good works, and theirs is a reward unfailing.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  So who henceforth will give the lie to thee about the judgment ?
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges ?
