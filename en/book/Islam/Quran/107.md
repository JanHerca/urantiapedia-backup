<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Hast thou observed him who belieth religion ?
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  That is he who repelleth the orphan,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And urgeth not the feeding of the needy.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Ah, woe unto worshippers
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Who are heedless of their prayer;
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Who would be seen (at worship)
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Yet refuse small kindnesses!
