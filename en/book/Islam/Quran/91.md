<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the sun and his brightness,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And the moon when she followeth him,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And the day when it revealeth him,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And the night when it enshroudeth him,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And the heaven and Him Who built it,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And the earth and Him Who spread it,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And a soul and Him Who perfected it
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And inspired it (with conscience of) what is wrong for it and (what is) right for it.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  He is indeed successful who causeth it to grow,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And he is indeed a failure who stunteth it.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  (The tribe of) Thamud denied (the truth) in their rebellious pride,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  When the basest of them broke forth
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And the messenger of Allah said: It is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink!
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  But they denied him, and they hamstrung her, so Allah doomed them for their sin and rased (their dwellings).
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  He dreadeth not the sequel (of events).
