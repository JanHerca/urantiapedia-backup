<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Woe unto every slandering traducer,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Who hath gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  He thinketh that his wealth will render him immortal.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Consuming One is!
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  (It is) the fire of Allah, kindled,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Which leapeth up over the hearts (of men).
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Lo! it is closed in on them
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  In outstretched columns.
