<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And Earth yieldeth up her burdens,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And man saith: What aileth her ?
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  That day she will relate her chronicles,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Because thy Lord inspireth her.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  That day mankind will issue forth in scattered groups to be shown their deeds.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And whoso doeth good an atom's weight will see it then,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight will see it then.
