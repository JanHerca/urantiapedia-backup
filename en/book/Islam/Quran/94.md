<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And eased thee of the burden
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Which weighed down thy back;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And exalted thy fame ?
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  But lo! with hardship goeth ease,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Lo! with hardship goeth ease;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  So when thou art relieved, still toil
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And strive to please thy Lord.
