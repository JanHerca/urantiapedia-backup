<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the morning hours
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And by the night when it is stillest,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And verily the latter portion will be better for thee than the former,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And verily thy Lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Did He not find thee an orphan and protect (thee) ?
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Did He not find thee wandering and direct (thee) ?
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee) ?
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Therefor the orphan oppress not,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Therefor the beggar drive not away,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Therefor of the bounty of thy Lord be thy discourse.
