> We all know the nature of life and the real, though only with exquisite care can we tell the truth about them.

> C. I. Lewis, in _Mind and the World Order_ 

> Can I see another’s woe 
> And not be in sorrow too? . . . 
> Can a father see his child 
> Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?  
> 
> And can he who smiles on all 
> Hear the wren with sorrows small, 
> Hear the small bird's grief and care, 
> Hear the woes that infants bear,  
> 
> And not sit beside the nest,  
> Pouring pity in their breast,  
> And not sit the cradle near, 
> Heaping tear on infant's tear . . . ?  
> 
> O, no! never can it be! 
> Never, never can it be!  
> 
> O! he gives to us his joy, 
> That our grief he may destroy; 
> Till our grief is fled and gone 
> He doth sit by us and moan. 
> 
> William Brake, in _Songs of Innocence_
