At Urantiapedia we are building a large archive of reader-created articles covering all topics of interest that appear in _The Urantia Book_. Currently the list of planned items exceeds a thousand.

We are not adding the articles in PDF or Word format, or as links to other sites. When an article is added, it becomes its own web page within Urantiapedia and is cataloged by author and subject. References to _The Urantia Book_ and other books are corrected in the conversion to try to link directly to the rest of Urantiapedia. In this way the articles are much more useful because they allow navigation between them and the rest of the content, especially _The Urantia Book_, allow for searching inside them and are more integrated with all the website.

There are two types of articles according to the permissions for their edition:
1. Author articles are created by users who are the only ones with permission to edit them. Editing of these articles is restricted to the users who created them or to whom those users have given permission.
2. Public articles are created by users who allow anyone to edit them. These articles are not restricted in their edition. All users with permissions to edit articles can modify them.

This and other information about how articles are organized in the project can be found in [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help/content).
