At Urantiapedia we are creating a Newspaper Library, a large archive of reader-created articles covering all topics of interest that appear in _The Urantia Book_. Currently the list of planned articles exceeds 4,000.

We are not adding articles in PDF or Word format, or as links to other sites. When an article is added, it becomes its own web page within Urantiapedia and is cataloged by author and topic. In the conversion, references to _The Urantia Book_ and other books are corrected to try to link directly to the rest of Urantiapedia, as explained in [Unique Global Reference System for The Urantia Book](/en/help/links#unique-global-reference-system-for-the-urantia-book). This makes articles much more useful because they allow you to navigate between them and the rest of the content, especially _The Urantia Book_, they allow you to search within them, and they are more integrated with the rest of the website.

There are two types of articles based on the permissions for editing them:
1. Author articles are created by users who are the only ones with permission to edit them. These articles are restricted from being edited by the users who created them or to whom those users have given permission.
2. Public articles are created by users who allow anyone to edit them. These articles are not restricted from being edited. All users with permission to edit articles can edit them.

This and other information about how articles are organized in the project can be found in the [Help of Urantiapedia](/en/help/content).
