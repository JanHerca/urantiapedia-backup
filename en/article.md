At Urantiapedia we are maintaining a large archive of articles created by readers that cover all topics of interest that appear in _The Urantia Book_. Currently the list of planned articles exceeds several thousands.

We are not adding the articles in PDF or Word format, or as links to other sites. When an article is added, it becomes its own web page within Urantiapedia and is archived by author and topic. In the conversion, references to _The Urantia Book_ and other books are corrected to try to link directly with the rest of the Urantiapedia, as explained in [Unique global reference system for The Urantia Book](/en/help/links#unique-global-reference-system-for-the-urantia-book). In this way the articles are much more useful because they allow navigation between them and the rest of the content, especially _The Urantia Book_, they allow searches within them and are more integrated with the rest of the website.

There are two types of articles depending on the permissions for editing:
1. Author articles are created by users who are the only ones with permission to edit them. These articles are restricted from editing to the users who created them or to whom those users have given permission.
2. Public articles are created by users who allow anyone to edit them. These articles are not restricted in edition. All users with article editing permissions can modify articles.

This and other information about how the articles in the project are organized can be found in [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help/content).
