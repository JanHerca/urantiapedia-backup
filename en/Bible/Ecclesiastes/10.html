<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; [so] doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one [that] he is a fool. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; [and] he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A fool also multiplieth words: [yet] man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. </p>
