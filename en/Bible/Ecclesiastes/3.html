<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I said in my heart, [It is] because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are [but as] beasts. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth? <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him [back] to see what shall be after him? </p>
