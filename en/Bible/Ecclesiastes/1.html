<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  There is no remembrance of the former [generations]; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter [generations] that are to come, among those that shall come after. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I communed with mine own hear, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. </p>
