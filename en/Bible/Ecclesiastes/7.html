<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A [good] name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of one's birth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; [and] the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything [that shall be] after him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth [his life] in his evil-doing. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I turned about, and my heart [was set] to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, [and] whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, [laying] one thing to another, to find out the account; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. </p>
