## Description

“Narrative of the Pseudo Joseph of Arimathea”

_From “The Apocryphal Gospels”, Aurelio de Santos Otero (1956)_; edition of C. Tischendorf, _Apocalypses Apocryphae_ (Lipsiae 1866) p.113-123.

Aurelio de Santos Otero says:

It is the one called by Tischendorf _Transitus A_. He used three codices for his edition:
- A Vate 4363, 13th century approx.
- B Ambros. 0 35, 14th century approx.
- C Laurenziano; the same one that contains the gospel of _Ps. Matthew_. The latter offers great divergences in relation to the other two.

Although late, the present narrative arouses interest for having been the disseminator in the medieval West of many legends contained in the _Ps. John_ and in the _Thessalonian_. Add, in addition to this, the curious episode of Thomas, already outlined in some interpolated manuscripts from the _Thessalonian_, which has had its replica in the legend and in the Assumptionist iconography. Let us remember in this regard, as an example, the panel by N. Florentino (15th century), preserved in the old cathedral of Salamanca, where the Virgin appears throwing the famous girdle from the clouds to Thomas, who is kneeling over the head. empty tomb
