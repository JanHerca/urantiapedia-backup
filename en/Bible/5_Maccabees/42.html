<p> <i>The history of Cesar, king of the Romans</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  It is reported that there was at Rome a certain woman who was pregnant, who, being near to her delivery, and racked with most violent pains of childbirth, died: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  but as the child was in motion, the belly of the mother was opened, and it was brought forth thence and lived, and grew, and was named Julius, because he was born in the fifth month; and was called Cesar, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  because the belly of his mother, from whence he was extracted, was ripped open. (Lat. caesa.) </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But when the elder of Rome sent Pompey into the east, he likewise sent Cesar into the west, to subdue certain nations which had revolted from the Romans. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Ceesar went, and conquered them, and reduced them to obedience to the Romans, and returned to Rome with great glory: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and his fame increased, and his affairs became much renowned, and excessive pride took hold on him; wherefore he requested the Romans to name him king. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But the elder and governors answered him, “Truly our fathers took an oath in the days of Tarquin the king,—who had taken by force another man’s wife, who laid hands on herself that he might not enjoy her, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  —that they would not give the title of king to any of those who should be placed at the head of their affairs; on account of which oath (said they) we are not able to gratify you in this particular.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Wherefore he stirred up seditions, and waged furious battles at Rome, slaying many people, until he seized on the throne of the Romans, and entitled himself king, putting a diadem on his head. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  From thenceforth they were called kings of the Romans, from their kingdom: they were also called Ceesars. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When therefore Pompey heard this news of Caesar, and that he had slain the three hundred and twenty governors, he collected his armies and marched into Cappadocia: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and Cesar going to meet him engaged him, conquered and slew him, and gained possession of the whole territory of the Romans. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  After this, Caesar went into the province of Syria; whom Mithridates the Armenian met with his army, assuring him that he was come with peaceful designs, and was ready to attack whatsoever enemies he should command. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Cesar ordered him to depart into Egypt; and Mithridates marched till he came to Ascalon. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Now Hyrcanus feared Caesar very much, because his submission to Pompey, whom Cesar had slain, was known. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore he despatched hastily Antipater with a brave army to assist Mithridates: and Antipater marched to him, and aided him against a certain one of the cities of Egypt, and they took it. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But as they departed thence, they found an army of the Jews who dwelled in Egypt, making a stand at the entrance, to prevent Mithridates from entering Egypt. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Antipater produced to them a letter from Hyrcanus, commanding them to desist, and not oppose Mithridates, the friend of Cesar. And they forbore. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But the others marched till they came to the city of the then reigning king; who came out to them with all the armies of the Egyptians, and when they engaged with him, he conquered and routed them; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and Mithridates turned his back and fled; whom, when “he was surrounded by the Egyptian troops, Antipater saved from death: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and Antipater and his men ceased not to resist the Egyptians in battle, whom he routed and conquered, and won the whole country of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Mithridates wrote to Cesar, shewing him what Antipater had done, and what battles he had endured, and what wounds he had received; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and that the winning of the country was to be ascribed not to him but to Antipater, and that he had reduced the Egyptians to obedience unto Cesar. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And when Cesar had read the letter of Mithridates, he commended Antipater for his exploits,-and resolved to advance and exalt him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  After these acts, Mithridates and Antipater went to Cesar, who then was at Damascus; and he obtained from Caesar whatsoever he liked, and he promised him whatever he wished for. </p>
