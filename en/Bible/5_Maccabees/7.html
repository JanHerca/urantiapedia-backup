<p> <i>The account of the death of Mattathias, and the acts of Judas his son after him.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Mattathias became infirm. And when he was near to death, he called his sons, who were five, and said unto them: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “I know of a certainty that very many and great wars will be kindled in the land of Judah, for the sake [or, by reason] of those matters for which the great and good God has stirred us up to wage war against our enemies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But I charge you that you fear God, and trust in him, and be zealous of the law, and the sanctuary, and the people also; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and prepare yourselves to wage war against its enemies: and fear not death, because, without doubt, this is decreed unto all men. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So that, if God shall make you victorious, you have at once obtained that which you were longing for: but if you fall, that is no loss to you in his sight.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Mattathias died and was buried; and his sons did according to that which he had commanded them. And they agreed to make their brother Judas their leader. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now Judas their brother was the best in counsel, and bravest in strength of them all. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And an army was sent against them by Felix”, under a man who was called Seron’, whom Judas with his company put to flight, and he slew great numbers. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the fame of Judas was spread abroad, and increased greatly in the ears of men: and all the nations which were round about him feared him exceedingly. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And it was told to king Antiochus what Mattathias and his son Judas had done. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  News of this came also to the king of the Persians; so that he played false with Antiochus, departing from his friendship, following the example of Judas. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Which giving Antiochus a great deal of uneasiness, he called to him one of his household officers named Lysias‘, a stout and brave man, and said to him; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I have now determined to go into the land of Persia to make war; and I wish to leave behind me my son in my stead; and to take with me the half of my army, and to leave the remainder with my son: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and behold I have given to you the governance of my son, and the governance of the men whom I leave with him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And verily you know what Mattathias and Judas have done to my friends and my subjects. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore, send one to lead a powerful army into the land of Judah; and command him to attack the land of Judah with the sword, and to root them out, and to demolish their dwellings, and to destroy all traces of them.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then Antiochus departed into the country of Persia. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But Lysias made ready three hardy and brave generals, skilled in war; of whom one was named. Ptolemy, a second Nicanor, and the third Gorgias. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And with them he sent forty thousand chosen troops and seven thousand horsemen. He also charged them to bring with them an army of Syrians, and Philistines; and ordered them to root out the Jews entirely. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And they marched forth, carrying with them a multitude of merchants, that they might sell to them the captives which they were about to obtain from among the Jews. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But tidings of this came to Judas the son of Mattathias; and he went to the house of the great and good God; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and assembled his men, and enjoined them a fast, and supplications, and prayers to the great and good God; and charged that they should beseech Him for victory against their enemies; which thing they did. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  After this, Judas collecting his men, appointed over each thousand a chief, and likewise over each hundred, and over each fifty, and over each ten. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Then he commanded proclamation to be niade by trumpet throughout his army, that whosoever was fearful, and whomsoever God commanded to be dismissed from the army, he should return home. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And great numbers returned; and there remained with them seven thousand stout and brave men, skilled in wars and accustomed thereto; nor had any one of them ever fled: and they marched against their enemies. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But when they had drawn nigh to them, Judas prayed to his Lord, intreating Him that He would turn away from him the malice of his enemy; and that He would assist him, and render him victorious. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Then he commanded the priests to sound the trumpets, which they did: and all his men called upon God, and rushed upon the army of Nicanor. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And God gave them victory over them, and they turned him and his men to flight, killing of them nine thousand men, and the rest were dispersed. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Judas and his company returned to Nicanor’s camp, and made spoil of it; and plundered very much property of the merchants, and sent it to be divided among the sick. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  This battle took place on the sixth day of the week; wherefore Judas and his men remained on the same spot until the sabbath-day had passed. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Then they marched against Ptolemy and Gorgias, whom they found and defeated, and gained a victory over them, slaying twenty thousand of their troops. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And Ptolemy and Gorgias fled; whom Judas and his company pursued; yet he could not overtake them, because they betook themselves into a city of two idols, and fortified themselves therein with the remnant of their army. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And Judas attacked Felix; and he was put to flight before him. And Judas pursued him. Who, coming to a certain house which was nigh at hand, entered into it and closed the doors, for it was a fortified house. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And Judas commanded, and he set fire to it; and the house was burned, and Felix was burned in it. So Judas took vengeance on him for Hleazar and the others whom Feelix had put to death. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Afterwards the people returned to the slain, and took their spoils and their armour; but the best of the prey they sent into the Holy Land. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  But Nicanor departed in disguise unknown, and returned to Lysias, and told him all which had happened to him and his company. </p>
