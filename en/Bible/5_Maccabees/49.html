<p> <i>The history of Antigonus the son of Aristobulus, and of his capedition against his uncle Hyrcanus: and of the succour which was obtained from the king of the Persians.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Augustus and Antony had arrived at Rome, Antigonus went to the king of the Persians, and promised him a thousand talents of coined gold, and eight hundred virgins of the daughters of Judah and of its princes, beautiful and wise; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  if he would send with him a general leading a great army against Jerusalem, and would order him to make him king over Judah, and would take prisoner his uncle Hyrcanus, and kill Herod and his brother. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To whom the king assenting, sent with him a general with a great army: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and they marched until they came into the land of Syria; and they slew a friend of Antony and certain Romans who were dwelling there. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  From thence they marched against the Holy City; professing security and peace, and that Antigonus had only come to pray in the sanctuary, and then would return to his own friends. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they entered the city; into which when they had gotten, they played foul, and began to kill men, and to plunder the city, according to the orders of the king of Persia to them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Herod and his men ran forward to defend the palace of Hyrcanus: but he sent his brother, and commanded him to guard the way which leads from the walls to the palace. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when he had possessed himself of each position, he chose out some of his men, and marched against the Persians who were in the city; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and his brother followed with a certain number of his men; and they slew the greater part of the Persians who were in the city, but the rest fled out of the city. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And when the general of the Persians saw that things had not gone to his mind, he despatched messengers to Herod and his brother, to treat for peace; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  informing them, that now he was satisfied of their valour and bravery, that they ought to be preferred to Antigonus; and that for that reason he would persuade his troops to aid Hyrcanus and them rather than Antigonus: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and this his wish he confirmed by the most solemn oaths, so that Hyrcanus and Phaselus believed him, but not Herod. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So Hyrcanus and Phaselus, going out to the general of the Persians, signified to him their reliance on him; and he advised them to go to his colleague who was at Damascus; and they went. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when they were come to him, he received them honourably, and made a display of holding them in high esteem, and treated them courteously; although he had secretly given orders that they should be made prisoners. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And some of the principal men of the land coming to them, told them of this very design; advising them to flee, with a promise of aiding their escape. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But they did not trust these men, fearing lest it were some plot against them; wherefore they stayed. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And when night came on, they were seized: Phaselus indeed laid hands on himself; but Hyrcanus was bound in chains, and by order of the general of the Persians his ear was cut off, that he might never be high priest again; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and he sent him to Herak, to the king of the Persians; to whom when he came, the king ordered his chains to be struck off, and shewed him kindness; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and he remained in Herak loaded with honours, until Herod demanded him from the king of the Persians: and when he was sent back to Herod, those things befell him which did befall him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  After this, the general went up with Antigonus into the Holy City: and it was told Herod what had been done to. Hyrcanus and Phaselus: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  wherefore taking his mother Cypris, and his wife Mariamne the daughter of Aristobulus, and her mother Alexandra, he sent them with horses and much baggage to Joseph his brother to mount Sarah: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  but himself with an army of a thousand men marched slowly, and waited for those of the Persians who might attempt to pursue him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And the general of the Persians pursued him with his army; whom Herod attacked, and conquered, and put to flight. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  After this, Antigonusâ€™ troops also pursued him, and fought with him most fiercely: and these he smote, and slew great numbers of them. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Then he marched to the mountains of Sarah; and found his brother Josephus, whom he ordered to secure the families in a safe place, and to provide all things which were necessary for them: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and he gave them abundance of money, that if need were, they might buy themselves provisions. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And having left his men with his brother Josephus, himself with a few companions went into Egypt, that he might take ship and proceed to the country of the Romans. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Cleopatra entertained him courteously, and requested him to take the command of her armies and the management of all her affairs; to whom he notified that it was quite necessary for him to go to Rome. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And she gave him money and ships: and he went till he reached Rome, and abode with Antony, and told him what Antigonus had done, and what he had committed against Hyrcanus and his brother, by help of the king of the Persians: </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  and Antony rode with him to Augustus and to the senate, and told them the selfsame thing. </p>
