<p> <i>The relation of Antiochus’ return, and of his going into the land of Judah, and of the disease which fell on him, of which he died in his journey.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But Antiochus returned out of the country of Persia, flying, with his army disbanded. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when he had learned what had happened to his army which Lysias had sent forth, and to all his men, he went out with a large army, marching to the land of Judah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now when in his progress he had reached the middle of his journey, God smote his troops with most mighty weapons: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but this could not stop him from his journey; but he persisted in it, uttering all sorts of insolence against God, and saying that no one could turn him aside, nor hinder him from his determined purposes. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wherefore the great and good God smote him also with ulcers which attacked the whole of his body: but even yet he did not desist, nor refrain from his journey; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but was more filled with wrath, and inflamed with an eager desire to obtain what he had determined on, and to carry his resolution into effect. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now there were in his army very many elephants. It so happened that one of these ran away, and made a bellowing: upon which the horses which were drawing the couch on which Antiochus lay, ran off, and threw_him out. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And, as he was fat and corpulent, his limbs were bruised, and some of his joints were dislocated. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the bad smell of his ulcers, which already sent forth a foetid odour, was so much increased, that neither he himself could longer endure it, nor could those who came near him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So when he fell, his servants took him up, and carried him upon their shoulders: but as the foul smell grew worse, they threw him down and departed to a distance. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore, perceiving the evils which surrounded him, he believed for certain that all that punishment had come upon him from the great and good God; by reason of the injury and the tyranny which he had used towards the Hebrews, and the unjust shedding of their blood. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In fear therefore he turned himself to God, and, confessing his sins, said; “O God, in truth I deserve the things which Thou hast sent upon me: and indeed just art Thou in thy judgments; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou humblest him who is exalted, and bringest down him who is puffed up: but thine is greatness, and magnificence, and majesty, and prowess. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Truly, I own, I have oppressed the people, and have both acted and decreed tyrannically against them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Forgive, I pray Thee, O God, this my error; and wipe out my sin, and bestow on me my health: and my care shall be to fill the treasury of thy house with gold and silver: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and to strew the floor of the house of thy sanctuary with purple vestments; and to be circumcised; and to proclaim throughout all my kingdom, that Thou only art the true God, without any partner, and that there is no God besides thee.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But God did not hear his prayers, nor accept his supplication: but his troubles so increased on him that he voided his bowels: and his ulcers increased to that degree, that his flesh dropt off from his body. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then he died, and was buried in his place. And his son reigned in his stead, whose name was Eupator. </p>
