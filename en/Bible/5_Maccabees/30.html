<p> <i>The account of the death of Alexander the son of Hyrcanus</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Afterwards king Alexander fell sick with a quartan fever, for three whole years. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But when the governor of a city named Ragaba revolted from him, he led thither a powerful army, taking with him his wife and family, and besieged the city. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But when it was on the point of being taken, his disease increased and his strength declined; and his wife, who was named Alexandra, lost all hope of his recovery: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  who going up to him said; “You know now what differences there are between you and the Pharisees: and your two sons are little boys, and I am a woman, and altogether we shall not be able to resist them: what advice therefore do you give to me and them?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He said to her, “My advice is, that you persevere against the city till it be taken, which will be shortly. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when it shall have been won, establish its government according as the other cities have been established. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But towards all these people, pretend that I am sick; and whatever you do, pretend that you do it at my suggestion; and reveal my death to those servants on whom you can depend. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when you shall have finished these matters, go into the city of the Holy House, having previously dried and embalmed my body with spices; and fill the place where I lie with many perfumes, that no unpleasant smell may proceed from me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when the affairs of the country are settled, go thence, and roll me up in abundance of perfumes, and carry me into the palace, as if sick: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and when I am there, send for the principal men of the Pharisees; and when they come, honour them, and speak good words to them: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  then say, Alexander is already dead, and behold I give him up to you, do with him whatever seems good to you: and from henceforth will behave to you as you shall please. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For if you do this, I know very well that they will do nothing to me and you, except that which is good; and the people will follow them, and your affairs will be ordered aright after my death, and you will reign securely until your two sons be grown up.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  After this, Alexander died; and his wife concealed his death; and when the city was taken, she returned to Jerusalem; and having sent for the chief men of the Pharisees, she addressed them as Alexander had advised her. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To whom they replied, that Alexander had been their king, and they had been his people; and they spoke to her with all affection, and promised to place her at the head of their government. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then they went out and collected men; and taking Alexander’s body, they carried it forth magnificently to its burial: and they sent for men to appoint Alexandra queen; with whose concurrence she was so appointed. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the years of Alexander’s reign were twenty-seven. </p>
