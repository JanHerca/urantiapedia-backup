<p> <i>The history of Simeon the son of Mattathias</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Simeon the son of Mattathias succeeded to the government; and he gathered together all those who remained of the army of Judas: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and his affairs prospered, and he subdued all those who had exercised hostility against the Jews after the death of his brother Judas; and he behaved well towards his people, and the matters of his country were rightly ordered. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore Antiochus? attacked him, and also Demetrius the son of Seleucus; and sent a great army against him: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  to meet which, Simeon and his two sons went out; and he divided his army into two parts, one of which he kept with himself, and gave the other to his sons. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then he and they which were with him went to the army; and he sent his two sons and their followers by another way, and appointed with them to attack the army at a given time. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  After this, he met the army of Antiochus, and attacked it, and began to prevail against it: and his two sons came when the battle had now begun, and the fight grew fierce, and they came round the rear of the army. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Antiochus’ army, being placed between two armies, was cut to pieces, nor did a single man of them escape: nor did Antiochus return any more to fight with Simeon. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And peace and quietness continued among the Jews all the days of Simeon. And the time of his government was two years. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then Ptolemy his son-in-law rushed on him, and slew him, at a certain feast where he was present. And he seized his wife and his two sons. And Simeon’s son, whose name was Hyrcanus, was set in his father’s place. </p>
<p> [Here ends the history as given in the two books usually attached to our Bibles.] </p>
