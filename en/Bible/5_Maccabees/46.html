<p> <i>The history of the death of Antipater</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now the princes of Judah had taken counsel to slay Antipater; and for that purpose had se| cretly set upon him a man who was called Malchiah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Malchiah made the attempt, but its execution was delayed for a long time. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the report of it reached Antipater, who sought out Malchiah to kill him: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but Malchiah cleared himself in the sight of Antipater of the things whereof he had been accused to him; and sware to him that the report was groundless: and Antipater believed him, putting aside all suspicion from him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But Malchiah, having given a large sum of money to Hyrcanus’ cup-bearer, agreed with him to give Antipater poison, while he was on the banqueting couch in the king’s presence. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the cup-bearer did this, and king Antipater> died on that same day: and the thing was not by the design, nor with the knowledge, of the king. And when Antipater was dead, Hyrcanus substituted Malchiah in his place. </p>
