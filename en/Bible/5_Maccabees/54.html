<p> <i>The history of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander, the uncle of Antigonus, and of his return into Jerusalem at the request of Herod, and of the death to which he put him.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hyrcanus, after that the king of the Persians had set him at liberty, remained in Herakin, in a most respectable condition and great honour: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  wherefore Herod was afraid lest any thing might induce the king of the Persians to appoint him king’, and send him into the land of Judah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore wishing to set his mind at rest, he laid plots for this business; and sent to the king of the Persians a very great present, and a letter; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  in which he made mention of Hyrcanus’ deserts and kind deeds towards him; and how he had gone to Rome on account of what Antigonus his brother’s son had done to him; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and that having now attained the throne, and his affairs being in order, he wished to reward him in a proper manner for the benefits which he had conferred. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So the king of the Persians sent a messenger to Hyrcanus, saying; “If you wish to return into “the land of Judah, return: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but I warn you to “beware of Herod; and I distinctly inform you, “that he does not seek for you to do you any “good, but his design is to render himself secure, “as there is none remaining whom he fears, ex“cept you: wherefore take heed of him most dili“gently, and be not led into a snare.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The Jews of Babylon also came to him, and said to him the like words. Again they say to him, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “You now are an old man, and not fit to discharge the “office of high priest, because of the stain which “your nephew inflicted on you: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  but Herod is a bad man, and a shedder of blood; and he recalls you only because he fears you; and you do not want for any thing among us, and you are with us in that station in which you ought to be. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And your family there is in the best condition; wherefore remain with us, and do not aid your enemy against yourself.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But Hyrcanus acceded not to their words; nor listened to the advice of one who advised him well. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he set out and journeyed till he came into the Holy City, for the very great longing which he had towards the house of God, his family, and his country. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when he had come near to the city, Herod met him, shewing such honour and magnificence, that Hyrcanus was deceived, and trusted in him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Herod in the public assembly, and before his own friends, used to call him “Father:” but nevertheless he ceased not to devise plots in his heart, only so that they should not be imputed to him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore Alexandra and Mariamne her daughter go to Hyrcanus, putting him in fear of Herod, and counselling him to take care of him self; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but neither to them did he attend, although they repeated this to him again and again, advising him to flee to some one of the kings of the Arabians: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  yet he attended not to all these things, until they drove him to it by repeated warnings and alarmings. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then therefore-he wrote to that king of Arabia; and having sent for a certain man, (whose brother Herod had slain, and had confiscated his goods, and had visited him with many evils,) he told him that he wished to impart to him a certain secret, adjuring him not to tell it to any one; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and giving him money and the letter to the king of the Arabians, communicated to him what he requested in the letter. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  So the messenger, having received the letter, thought that he should obtain a high post with Herod, and should remove from himself the evil which he was continually fearing at his hands, if he communicated the matter to Herod; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and that this would be more profitable to him than the keeping of Hyrcanus’ secret: since in the other case he was not safe, and sure that the thing would not be told to Herod at some time or other, and thus would be the cause of his destruction. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He therefore carried the letter to Herod, and unfolded to him the whole business: who said to him, Carry the letter, as it is, to the king of the Arabians, and bring me back his answer, that I may know it: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  tell me also the place where the men will be, whom the king of the Arabians will send, that Hyrcanus may go back with them. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  So the messenger went, and carried Hyrcanus’ letter to the king of the Arabians; who rejoiced, and sent some of his men; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  ordering them to go to a certain place near to the Holy City, and there to wait until Hyrcanus should come to them; and then to attend Hyrcanus till they brought him to his presence. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He wrote likewise to Hyrcanus an answer to his letter, and sent it by the messenger. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  So the men proceeded with the messenger to the appointed place, and there waited: but the messenger carried the letter to Herod, who learned its contents: he told him also the place of the men, to whom Herod sent persons to take them. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Afterwards, having sent for seventy old men of the elders of the Jews, and having sent also for Hyrcanus; when he came, he said to him, Is there any interchange of letters between you and the king of the Arabians? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  and Hyrcanus said, No. Then he said to him, Did you send that you might flee to him? and he said, No. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And Herod ordered his messenger to come forward, and the Arabians, and the horses; he also brought out the answer to his letter, and it was read. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Then he commanded Hyrcanus’ head to be stricken off'; and his head was stricken off, and no one dared to utter a word for him. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Now Hyrcanus had delivered Herodi from the death which was justly awarded him in the assembly of judgment, commanding the assembly to be deferred till the morrow, and sending away Herod that same night. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Whence he was destined to become his murderer, regardless of his services to him and to his father. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Hyrcanus was put to death when he was eighty years old, and he reigned forty years: nor was there any one of the kings of the Asmonzan race of a more praiseworthy conduct, or more honourable way of life. </p>
