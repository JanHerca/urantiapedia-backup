<p> <i>The history of the wars of Hyrcanus with the Samaritans</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Hyrcanus marched to Sebaste, and besieged the Samaritans who were therein, for a long time; till he reduced them to such straits, that they were compelled to feed upon every kind of dead carcass. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Nevertheless they bore this patiently, fearing his sword, and trusting to the Macedonians and Egyptians, whose aid they had implored. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In the mean time comes on the great fast, at which Hyrcanus must be present in the Holy House, to offer sacrifices on that day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wherefore he substituted his two sons, Antigonus and Aristobulus, as commanders of the army; leaving them orders to besiege the Samaritans, and reduce them to extremities. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Likewise he commanded the army to obey his sons, and to execute their or ders: and he departed to the city of the Holy House. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Moreover Antiochus the Macedonian marched to help the inhabitants of Sebaste; and tidings of it were brought to the two sons of Hyrcanus; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  who, having substituted a general to conduct the siege of Sebaste, went to meet Antiochus; whom they encountered and routed, and returned to Sebaste. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  There came likewise out of Egypt Lythras, the son of queen Cleopatra to help the Samaritans. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When news of this was brought to Hyrcanus, he went to meet him, the solemnity being now past: whom when he met, he encountered most fiercely, and slew very many of his men: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and Lythras was put to flight; nor did the Egyptians any more after this return to give assistance to the Samaritans. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And king Hyrcanys returned to Sebaste, and pressed sore on it, till he took it with the sword, and slew those of its citizens who were remaining, and utterly destroyed it, and pulled down its walls. </p>
