<p> <i>The account of the appointment of Hyrcanus the son of Alexander to be king of the Jews, and of the return to Rome of the general of the Roman army.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Having arranged these matters, Pompey appointed Hyrcanus to be king; and carried away his brother Aristobulus in chains: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  he also ordered that the Jews should have no dominion over those nations who had been subdued by their kings before his arrival; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he exacted a tribute from the city of the Holy House; and covenanted with Hyrcanus, that he should receive inauguration from the Romans every year. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he departed, taking with him Aristobulus, and two of his sons, and his daughters: and he had a son remaining, named Alexander, whom Pompey could not seize, because he had fled. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So Pompey placed in hisroom in the city of the Holy House, Hyrcanus, and Antipater, and with them his own colleague Scaurus. </p>
