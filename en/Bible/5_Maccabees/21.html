<p> <i>The history of the going up of Antiochus to the city of the Holy House, to fight with Hyrcanus.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now when Antiochus had heard that Simeon was dead, he collected an army, and marched until he came to the city of the Holy House: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and he encamped around it, and besieged it, designing to take it by force: but he could not, by reason of the height and strength of the walls, and the multitude of warriors who were in it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But by God’s will he was restrained from winning it: for le had betaken himself to the northern side of the city, and had built there an hundred and thirty towers opposite to the wall; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and had caused men to mount them, to fight with those who should endeavour to go up upon the walls of the city. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He also appointed men to dig up the earth in a certain spot, till they came to the foundation of the wall: which finding to be of wood, they burned it with fire, and a very large portion of the wall fell down. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Hyrcanus’ men opposed them, and prevented them from entering, keeping guard over the ruined portion; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and Hyrcanus went out with the better part of his fighting men against the army of Antiochus, and defeated them with great slaughter. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Antiochus and his men were routed; whom Hyrcanus with his troops pursued, till they had driven them away from the city. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then returning to the towers which Antiochus had built, they destroyed them; and abode in the city, and around it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But Antiochus encamped in a certain place, which was distant from the city of the house of God about two furlongs. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And at the approach of the feast of tabernacles Hyrcanus sent ambassadors to him, to treat for a truce until the solemnity should be passed; which he granted him; and sent victims, and gold and silver”, to the house of God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Hyrcanus commanded the priests toFeceive what Antiochus had sent; and they did so. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Now when Hyrcanus and the priests saw the reverence of Antiochus towards the temple of God, he sent ambassadors to him, to treat for peace. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To which Antiochus agreed; and he went to Jerusalem: and Hyrcanus meeting him, they entered the city together. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Hyrecanus made a feast for Antiochus and his princes; and they did eat and drink together and he made him a present of three hundred talents of gold: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and each of them agreed with his companion about peace and rendering assistance, and Antiochus departed into his own country. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But it is related, that Hyrcanus opened the treasury, which had been made by some kings of the sons of David, [to whom be peace,] and he brought out thence a great sum of money, and left as much in it, consigning it to its former state of secrecy. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then he built up and repaired that part of the wall which had fallen down; and he provided carefully for the convenience and advantage of his flock, and behaved himself uprightly towards them. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Now when Antiochus had come into his own country, he determined to go and fight with the king of Persia, for he had revolted from the time of the first Antiochus: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and he sent ambassadors to Hyrcanus, that he should go to him; and Hyrcanus went with him, and departed into the country of Persia. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And an army of the Persians met him, arid fought with him; whom Antiochus putting to flight defeated and put to the sword. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then he stayed in the place where he was, and erected a wonderful building, that it might be a memorial of him in their country. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And after some time he went forward to meet the king of the Persians; and Hyrcanus remained behind, by reason of the sabbath, which Pentecost immediately followed. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the king of Persia and Antiochus met; and very great battles took place between them, in which Antiochus and many of his army were slain. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And when news of this was brought to Hyricanus, he marched into the country of Syria, and on his journey besieged Halepus: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and the citizens surrendered to him, paying him tribute; and he departed from them, and returned into the Holy City, and remained there for some days. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Then he departed into the country of Samaria, and fought against Neapolis; but the citizens hindered him from entering into it. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he destroyed whatever buildings they had on mount Jezabel, and the temple; which was done two hundred years after that Sanballat the Samaritan had built it. He also slew the priests who were in Sebaste. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And he marched into the country of Idumeza, that is, the mountains Sarah, and they surrendered to him: with whom he stipulated that they should be circumcised and adopt the religion of Torah (or the Mosaic law). </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And they agreed with him, and were circumcised, and became Jews, and were confirmed in this practice even till the destruction of the second house. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And Hyreanus | went on to all the surrounding nations; and hey all submitted to him, and at the same time entered into an agreement of peace and obedience. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He also sent ambassadors to the Romans, sahite ing to them concerning the renewal of the leaguewhich was between them. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  When therefore his ambassadors had come to the Romans, they honoured them; and appointed them a seat of dignity; and gave attention to the embassy on account of which they had come; and despatched their business, and replied to his letter. </p>
