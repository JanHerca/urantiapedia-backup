<p> <i>The history of the death of Malchiah</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now when Herod the son of Antipater was informed that Malchiah had caused his father’s death, he thought to rush openly upon Malchiah; but his brother prevented him from doing this, advising that he should be taken off by stratagem. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Herod went to Cassius, and told him what Malchiah had done: to whom the other replied, when I am gone to Tyre, and Hyrcanus is with me, and with him Malchiah, then rush on him and kill him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When therefore Cassius had gone to Tyre, and Hyrcanus had gone to join him, taking Malchiah with him; and they were standing together in Cassius’ presence, at a certain feast to which Cassius had invited them with all his friends: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  (now Cassius had given orders to his servants to do whatever Herod should order them:) </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Herod also was standing with his brother amongst the companions of Hyrcanus, and Herod agreed with some of the servants to kill Malchiah, when a signal should be given by a wink of the eye. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When therefore Hyrcanus had eaten and drunken with his friends, they went to sleep in the afternoon: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and when they had awaked from sleep, Hyrcanus ordered one to prepare a couch for him in the open air, before the entrance of the banqueting room in which they had slept: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and he himself sat down, and commanded Malchiah to sit with him: he also ordered Herod and his brother to be seated: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and Cassius’ servants stood near Hyrcanus; to whom Herod winked against Malchiah, and they immediately rushed on him and slew him: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and Hyrcanus was greatly frightened, and fell into a fit of fainting. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But when Cassius’ attendants had retired, and the slain Malchiah was carried out, Hyrcanus came to himself again, and asked of Herod the cause of Malchiah’s death. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Herod answered; “I am wholly ignorant, nor do I know the “cause of the thing.” And Hyrcanus held his peace, and never again asked more of the matter. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Cassius marched into Macedonia, to meet Octavian¢ the son of Cesar’s brother, and Antony the general of his army: for they had set out from Rome with a great army in search of Cassius. </p>
