<p> <i>The history of Hyrcanus the son of Simeon</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Simeon, while he was yet alive, had appointed Jochanan his son to be captain; and having gathered to him very many troops, he sent him to vanquish a certain man who had come out against him, and was called Hyrcanus. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Now he was a man of great fame, powerful in strength, and of an ancient sovereignty. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whom Jonathan encountered, and defeated: wherefore Simeon named his son Jochanan Hyrcanus; on account of his slaying Hyrcanus, and gaining a victory over him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But when this Hyrcanus had heard that Ptolemy had killed his father, he was afraid of Ptolemy, and fled to Gaza: and Ptolemy pursued him with many followers. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But the citizens of Gaza helped Hyrcanus, and shut the gates of their city, and hindered Ptolemy from reaching Hyrcanus. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Ptolemy returned, and departed to Dagon‘, having with him the mother of Hyrcanus and his two brothers. strongly fortified castle. Now Dagon had at that time a strongly fortified castle. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Hyrcanus went to the Holy House, and offered sacrifices, and succeeded his father: and he collected a large army and went to attack Ptolemy. Wherefore Ptolemy shut the gate of Dagon upon himself and his company, and fortified himself therein. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Hyrcanus besieged him, and made an iron ram to batter the wall, and to open it: and the battle between them lasted long, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and Hyrcanus prevailed against Ptolemy, and went up close to the castle, and almost took it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When Ptolemy therefore saw this, he commanded the mother of Hyrcanus and his two brothers to be brought out upon the wall, and to be tortured most severely; which was done to them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But Hyrcanus, seeing this, stood still; and fearing that they would be put to death, desisted from fighting. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To whom his mother called out, and said; “My son, do not be moved by love and filial piety towards me and your brethren, in preference to your father: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  nor on account of our captivity be weakened in your desire of avenging him; but demand satisfaction for the rights of your father and mine, to the utmost of your power. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But that which you fear for us from that tyrant, he will necessarily do to us at all events: wherefore press forward your siege without any intermission.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  When therefore Hyrcanus had heard the words of his mother, he urged on the siege: wherefore Ptolemy increased the tortures of his mother and his brothers; and sware that he would throw them headlong from the castle, as often as Hyrcanus came near to the wall. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Therefore Hyrcanus feared, lest he should be the cause of their death; and he returned to his camp, still continuing “the siege of Ptolemy. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Now it happened, that the feast of tabernacles was at hand’; wherefore Hyrcanus went into the city of the Holy House, that he might be present at the feast and the solemnity and the sacrifices. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And when Ptolemy knew that he had departed to the Holy City, and was detained there, he seized upon the mother of Hyrcanus and his brothers, and slew them; and he fled into a place whither Hyrcanus could not come. </p>
