<p> \textit2{The history of the fight of Aristobulus and his son Antigonus from Rome, and their return into the land of Judah: also, an account of the death of Aristobulus} </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Aristobulus devised plans, till he had succeeded in escaping from Rome with his son Antigonus, and had arrived in the city of Judah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when Aristobulus shewed himself in public, a great multitude of men flocked round him; out of whom he selected eight thousand, and marched against Gabinius, and engaged him; and there were slain of the Roman army a very great number: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  there fell also of his own men seven thousand, but one thousand escaped; and the enemy’s army pursued him; but he and they who were left to him ceased not to resist even till the total destruction of his men; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  nor was there one left but he alone; and he fought most furiously until he fell overpowered by wounds, and was taken and led to Gabinius; who ordered him to be taken care of until he was healed. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then he sent him in chains to Rome. </p>
<p> [And he remained shut up in prison until the reign of Caesar; who brought him out of prison, and loaded him with gifts and favours; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and giving to him two generals and twelve thousand men, sent him into the land of Judah, [B.C. 49.] to detach the Jews from Pompey’s party, and bring them over to obey Cesar: for Pompey at that time was governor of the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the report of Aristobulus and his party reached Hyrcanus; who was greatly afraid, and wrote to Antipater to avert his power from him by his customary devices. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So Antipater sent some of the chief men of Jerusalem, giving to one of them poison, charging him to administer it craftily to Aristobulus. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they met him in the land of Syria, as though they were ambassadors to him from the Holy City: and he received them joyfully, and they did eat and drink with him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And those men laid plots till they gave him the poison; and he died, and was buried in the land of Syria. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Now the time of his reign’, until he was taken prisoner the first time, was three years and a half; and he was a man of courage, weight, and excellent disposition. ] </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now Gabinius had written to the senate, to send away his two sons to their mother, since she had requested it; which they did. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But it came to pass, that when Pompey had departed to a great distance from Jerusalem, they broke their engagement of obedience to the Romans: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  wherefore Gabinius went against them, encountered them, and conquered them, and reduced them again to submission to the Romans. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  In the mean time the land of Egypt rebelled against Ptolemy, and expelled him from his royal city, refusing to pay tribute to the Romans. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Whereupon Ptolemy wrote to Gabinius that he should come and help him against the Egyptians, that he might bring them again into subjection to the Romans. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Gabinius marched out of the country of Syria, and wrote to Hyrcanus to meet him with an army, that they might go to Ptolemy. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Antipater went with a large army to Gabinius, and met him at Damascus, congratulating with him on the victory which he had gained over the Persians: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and Gabinius ordered him to hasten to Ptolemy, which he did, and fought against the Egyptians, and slew of them a very great number. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Afterwards Gabinius coming up, replaced Ptolemy on his throne, and went back to the Holy City, and renewed Hyrcanus’ sovereignty, and returned to Rome. </p>
