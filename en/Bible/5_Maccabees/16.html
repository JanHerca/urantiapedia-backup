<p> <i>The history of the arrival at Antioch of Demetrius the son of Seleucus, and of his defeating Eupator.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After these things, king Eupator marched into the country of Macedonia, and then returned to Antioch. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whom Demetrius attacked with an army of Romans, and defeated, and slew, together with Lysias his cousin’s son; and he reigned at Antioch. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But to him went Alcimus, the leader of those three? wicked men; who, coming into his presence, prostrated himself before him, and wept most vehemently, and said; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “O king, Judas and his company have been slaying great numbers of us; because, having desert ed their religion, we have embraced the religion of the king. Wherefore, O king, assist us against them, and avenge us on them.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then he made the Jews go to him, and incensed him; suggesting to them such things as might provoke Demetrius, and irritate him to fit out an army to vanquish Judas. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To whom the king giving heed, sent a general named Nicanor, with a great army and an abundant supply of weapons of war. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when Nicanor had come into the Holy Land, he sent messengers to Judas to come to him; and did not disclose that he had come to conquer the nation, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  but stated that he came only on account of the peace which was made between him and the nation, and that they also were under obedience to the Romans. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Judas went out to him with a certain number of his men, who were endued with strength and courage: and he commanded them not to go far from him, lest Demetrius might lay a snare for him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When therefore he had met Demetrius, he saluted him; and, a seat being placed for each of them, they sat down, and Demetrius conversed with him as he pleased: afterwards each of them went into a tent which the troops had erected for him. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Nicanor and Judas departed into the Holy City, and there dwelt together: and a firm friend ship grew up between them: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  which being made known to Alcimus, he went to Demetrius and incensed him against Judas, and persuaded him to write and command Nicanor to send Judas to him bound in chains. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But tidings of this came yo to Judas, and he went out from the city by night, and departed to Sebaste, and sent to his companions to come to him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when they were come, he sounded the trumpet, and commanded them to prepare themselves to attack Nicanor. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But Nicanor sought Judas with great diligence, and could learn no tidings of him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore he went to the house of God, requiring of the priests to give him up to him, that he might send him bound in chains to the king: but they sware that he had not come into the house of God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Whereupon he abused both them and the house of God, and spake insolently of the temple, and threatened that he would demolish it from the very foundations; and departed in a rage. He also took care to search all the houses of the Holy City. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Likewise he sent his men to the house of a certain excellent mans’, who had been seized in the time of Antiochus, and put to extreme torture; but after the death of Antiochus the Jews increased his authority and greatly honoured him. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And when the messengers of Nicanor came to him, he feared lest he should meet with the same treatment which he had received from Antiochus; wherefore he laid hands on himself. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  When this was told to Judas, he was very sorry and much afflicted: and he sent to Nicanor, saying; “Do not seek me in the city, for I am not there: therefore come forth to me, that we may meet each other, either in the plains or in the mountains, as you chuse.” </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Nicanor went forth to him, and Judas met him with these words: “O God, it was Thou who didst exterminate the army of king Sennacherib; and he indeed was greater than this man, in fame, in empire, and in the multitude of his host: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and Thou didst deliver Ezechiah king of Judah from him, when he had trusted in Thee and prayed to Thee: deliver us, I pray thee, O God, from his malice, and make us victorious over him.” </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then he made ready himself for battle, and advanced to Nicanor, saying, “'Take care of your self, it is to you I come.” </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Nicanor turned his back and fled: and Judas pursuing smote him on the shoulders, which he divided; and his men were put to flight. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And there fell of them on that day thirty thousand: and the inhabitants of the cities went out and slew them, so that they left not one of them. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And they decreed that that day should be every year a day of thanksgiving to the great and good God, and a day of gladness, and of feasting, and of drinking. [Thus far is finished the Second Book from the translation of the Hebrews.] </p>
