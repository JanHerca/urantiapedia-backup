<p> <i>The history of the magnanimity of certain of Herod's men, and of their bravery.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now thieves, and they who were longing for the property of others, had multiplied during the time of Antigonus; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  betaking themselves to some caves in the mountains, to which there was no approach except for one man at a time, through certain places fitted for the purpose by them, and known to them alone: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and even though others should know them, they could not go up to the cave; because that a man was ever ready at the mouth, who, with a very little trouble, could easily repel a person who was climbing up. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And now some of these men had gotten to themselves in that cave abundance of arms, provisions, and drink, and all those things which they needed; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  together with all the spoils which they had gained by attacking those whom they met, and that which they had taken by right or wrong. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When therefore Herod had learnt their proceedings, and found that their matters were likely to cause delay‚Äù; also that men could not at present mount up to them by ladders, nor in fact climb up in any way: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  he made use of great wooden chests fitted and joined together, and filled them with men, (adding food and water,) bearing very long hooked spears: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and those chests he ordered to be let down from the summit of the mountains, at the middle of which the caves were, until they were placed opposite to their mouths: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and when they were opposite to these, he desired that his men should attack them in close fight with swords, and from a distance should drag them out with those spears. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the chests were made, and filled with men. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And when some of them were let down, and were opposite to the mouths of those caves, no information having been given to the persons living there; one of the men who were in the chests rushed into the caves, followed by his companions; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and they killed the robbers who were in them, together with their followers, and threw them down into the valleys below; all the men whom Herod had sent, emulating these jist. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And in this exploit, their courage, bravery, and boldness was so conspicuous, that the like of it was never seen: and they wholly rooted out the robbers from all those parts. </p>
