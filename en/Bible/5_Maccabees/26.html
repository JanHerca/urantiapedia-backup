<p> <i>The account of Hyrcanusâ€™ death, and of the time of his reign</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hyrcanus had three sons, namely, Antigonus, Aristobulus, and Alexander. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Hyrcanus loved Antigonus and Aristobulus; but Alexander was odious to him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And on a time he saw in a dream, that of his sons, Alexander would reign after his death; and this gave him uneasiness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he did not think fit, while he lived, to set up either of the sons whom he loved, on account of his vision; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  nor to appoint Alexander king, because he was disliked by him.. Wherefore he deferred the business; that after his death it might take that turn which should please the great and good God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now the Jews had been, in the time of his father and uncles, united in affection towards them; and prompt to obey them, on account of their subduing of their enemies, and the excellent feats which they performed. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They also continued united in affection to Hyrcanus; until the slaughter of the Pharisees was committed by him, and the rooting out of the Jews, and the civil wars on account of religion. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  From hence sprung perpetual enmities, and ceaseless evils, and many murders. Which was the reason why many detested Hyrcanus. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now the time of his reign was thirty-one? years, and he died. </p>
