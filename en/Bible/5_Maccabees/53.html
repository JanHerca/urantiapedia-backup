<p> <i>The history of Herod after the death of Antigonus</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Herod was certified of the death of Antigonus, he considered himself secure that no one of the royal Asmonzan family would contend with him: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  wherefore he employed himself in â€˜advancing the dignities, in kindnesses and promotions, of those who were well inclined to him and obeyed his will. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He also exerted himself in destroying those persons, together with their families, and in plundering their cattle and their goods, who had opposed him, furnishing aid against him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he oppressed persons, taking away their property, and despoiling all those who had shaken off obedience to the Jews; and slew those who resisted him, and plundered their goods. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Also he made an agreement with all who were obedient to him, that they should pay him money. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He also stationed guards at the gates of the Holy House, who might search those who went out, and take whatever gold or silver they should find on any one, and bring it to him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He also ordered the coffins of the dead to be searched; and whatever money any person might endeavour to carry out by stratagem, the same to be taken. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he heaped together so much money as none of the kings of the second house had amassed. </p>
