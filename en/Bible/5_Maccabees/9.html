<p> <i>The history of the eight days of dedication</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Judas had put to flight Ptolemy, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, and had slain their men; he himself and his troops returned into the country” of the holy house. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he commanded all the altars to be destroyed which Antiochus had ordered to be built: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he removed all the idols which were in the sanctuary: and they built up a new altar, and he commanded sacrifices to be offered upon that. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They prayed also to the great and good God, that He would bring forth the holy fire which might remain upon the altar: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and fire came out from some stones of the altar, and burned up the wood and the sacrifices; and from it fire continued on the altar until the third carrying into captivity’. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And then they kept the festival of the new altar for eight days, beginning on the twenty-fifth day of the month Casleu. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And then they placed bread on the table of the house of God, and lighted the lamps of the candlestick. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And on each of these eight days they assembled together for prayer and praise: and moreover they appointed it an ordinance for every year to come. </p>
