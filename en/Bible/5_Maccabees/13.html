<p> <i>An account of the letter of the Romans to Judas, and of the treaty which took place between them.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  “From the elder and three hundred and twenty governors, unto Judas, general of the army, and to the Jews. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Health be to you. We have already heard of your victories, and courage, and endurance in war; whereof we rejoice. We have also understood that you have entered into an agreement with Antiochus. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We write to you to this effect, that you should be friends to us, and not to the Greeks who have done you harm: moreover we intend to go to Antioch, and to make war upon its inhabitants: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  wherefore make haste to acquaint us with whom you are at enmity, and with whom you have a league of friendship; that we may act accordingly.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  THE COPY OF THE TREATY. “This is the treaty made by the elder and three hundred and twenty governors with Judas, general of the army, and the Jews; that they should be joined to the Romans, and that the Romans and Jews may be of one mind in wars and victories for ever. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now if war should come upon the Romans, Judas and his people shall help them, giving no aid to the enemies of the Romans, by provisions or by any kind of weapons. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when war shall come upon the Jews, the Romans shall help them to the utmost of their power, giving no aid to their enemies by assistance of any kind. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And as the Jews are bound to the Romans, so likewise are the Romans to the Jews, without any increase or decrease.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Judas and his people accepted this; and the treaty stood, and continued between them and the Romans for a long time. </p>
