<p> \text{The history of Crassus} </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Gabinius had returned to Rome, the Persians played false to the Romans; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and Crassus marched with a large army into Syria, and came to Jerusalem, requiring of the priests that they should deliver to him whatever money there was in the house of God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To whom they made answer, how will this be lawful for you, when Pompey, Gabinius, and others have deemed it unlawful? But he answered, I must do it at all events. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Eleazar the priest said to him, Swear to me that you will not lay your hand upon any thing which belongs to it, and I will give you three hundred mine of gold. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he sware to him that he would take nothing from the treasure of the house of God, if he would deliver to him what he had mentioned. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Eleazar gave him a bar of wrought gold, the upper part of which had been inserted into the wall of the treasury of the temple, upon which were placed every year the old veils of the house, new ones being substituted for them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the bar weighed three hundred minae of gold, and it was covered with the veils which were accumulated during a long course of years, being known to no one besides Eleazar. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Crassus then, having received this bar, broke his word, going back from the agreement made with Eleazar; and he took all the treasures of the temple, and plundered whatever money was therein, to the amount of two thousand talents: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  for this money had been accumulating from the building of the temple until that time, out of the spoils of the kings of Judah and their offerings, and also from the presents which the kings of the Gentiles had sent; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and they were multiplied and increased in the lapse of years; all which he took. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then that vile Crassus went off with the money and his army into the country of the Persians; and they defeated him and his army in battle, slaying them in a single day: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and the Persian army took as spoil every thing which was in the camp of Crassus. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  After this feat, they marched into the country of Syria, which they won, and detached from its submission to the Romans. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Which the Romans learning, sent a renowned general named Cassius with a great army: who, arriving in the country of Syria, drove out those of the Persians who were in it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then proceeding to the Holy City, he delivered Hyrcanus from the war which the Jews were waging against him, reconciling the parties. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Afterwards, passing the EuphratesÂ», he fought with the Persians, and brought them back to their subjection to the Romans: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  he also reduced to submission the two and twenty kings! whom Pompey had subdued; and reduced under obedience to the Romans every thing in the countries of the east. </p>
