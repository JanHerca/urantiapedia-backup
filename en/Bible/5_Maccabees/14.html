<p> <i>An account of the batile which took place between Judas, Ptolemy, and Gorgias.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After this, Ptolemy collected an hundred and twenty thousand men, and a thousand horsemen, and they went after Judas. And Judas met him with ten thousand men, and routed him, and many of Ptolemy’s men were slain. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he besought Judas, and humbly entreated him to let him escape with his life; and swore that he would never more make war against him, and that he would shew kindness to the Jews who were in all his countries. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Judas had compassion on him, and let him go; and Ptolemy adhered to his oath. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But Gorgias having collected three thousand men from mount Sarah’, (that is, of Idumea,) and four hundred horsemen, met Judas, and slew the captain of his army and certain of his men. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Judas and his men advanced towards them; and Gorgias was put to flight, and the greater part of his army was killed or fled: and he was sought for, and no tidings were heard of him; but it is reported that he fell in the battle. </p>
