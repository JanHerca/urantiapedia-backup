<p> <i>The account of the coming of Antigonus the son of Aristobulus unto Cesar, complaining of Antipater who had caused his father’s death.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But Antigonus the sonsef Aristobulus came to Cesar, and related to him the expedition of Aristobulus his father to attack Pompey, and how obedient and obsequious he was to him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then he told him that Hyrcanus and Antipater had secretly sent a man to his father to destroy him by poison, intending (sazd he) to assist Pompey against your friends. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Cesar therefore sent to Antipater, and questioned him on this matter; to whom Antipater replied; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Certainly I did obey Pompey, because then he was the ruling person, and conferred benefits on me; but I did not now fight with the Egyptians for the sake of Pompey, who is already dead; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  nor did I go through difficulties in defeating them and reducing them to obedience to Pompey; but I did this out of duty to Cesar, and that I might reduce Lins to obedience to him.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Antipater uncovered his head and his hands, and said; “These wounds, which are on my head and body, testify that my affection and obedience to Cesar are greater than my affection and obedience to Pompey; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  for I did not expose myself in the days of Pompey, to the things to which I have exposed my self in the days of king Cesar.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Cesar said to him, “Peace be to thee, and to all thy friends, O bravest of the Jews: for thou hast truly shewn this fortitude, magnanimity, obedience, and affection towards us.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And from that time Cesar increased in affection towards Antipater, and advanced him above all his friends, and promoted him to be general of his armies, and took him with him into the country of the Persians: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and he saw from his bravery and his successful exploits, that he more and more excited in him a longing and affection for him: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  at length he brought him back into the land of Judah, covered with honours and crowned with a post of authority . </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Caesar marched to Rome, having settled the affairs of Hyrcanus; who built the walls of the Holy City, and conducted himself towards the people in a most excellent manner: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for he was a good man, endued with virtues, of irreproachable life, but his inability in wars was notorious to all men. </p>
