<p> <i>The history of Alexander the son of Aristobulus</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Pompey had set out for Rome, Hyrcanus and Antipater marched against the Arabians, to bring them under the dominion of the Romans. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To which the Arabians submitted, trusting to their intimacy with Antipater, and paying great regard to his advice; by which acts Antipater designed to reconcile the Romans to him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore when Alexander the son of Aristoulus perceived the expedition of Hyrcanus, Antipater, and Scaurus, against the Arabians, and that they had departed to a great distance from the Holy City; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  he journeyed till he arrived there; and entering into the palace, he brought out thence money for the expence of repairing the city-wall which Pompey had broken down. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he raised for himself an army, and arranged all those matters which he wished, before Hyrcanus and his party should return to the city of the Holy House: and when they returned, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  he went out to meet them, and engaged them, and put them to flight. </p>
