<p> <i>The account of the death of Alexandra</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After these things, Alexandra fell into a disease, of which she died. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when her recovery was almost despaired of, her son Aristobulus went out from Jerusalem by night, attended by his servant: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he departed to Gabatha?, to a certain chief man among the Sadducees, one of his friends; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and taking him with him, he proceeded to the cities where the Sadducees dwelt; and opened to them his purpose, and exhorted them to go out with him, and to be his allies in war against his brother and the Pharisees, and to appoint him king. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To whom they assenting, openly played false with Alexandra, collecting men from feet quarter to join Aristobulus. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When the fame of these things reached Hyrcanus the son of Alexandra, the high priest, and the elders of the Pharisees, they went to Alexandra, sick as she was, and related the matter to her; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  pressing on her the great fear which they had for her and her son Hyrcanus, from Aristobulus and those who were with him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To whom she answered; “I truly am near death, so that it is more proper and profitable for me to attend to my own affairs; what therefore can I do, being situated thus? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But my men, and my goods, and my arms, are with you and in your hands; therefore order the business as it seemeth to you right, imploring the aid of God upon your matters, and asking deliverance from Him.” Then she died. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The amount of her age was seventy-three years; and the time of her reign nine years, </p>
