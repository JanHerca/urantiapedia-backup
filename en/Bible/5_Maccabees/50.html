<p> <i>The history of Herod when the Romans appointed him king over the Jews, and his departure from Rome with an army to fight against the Holy House.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Avugustus and the senate, informed of what Antigonus had done, with one consent appointed Herod king over the Jews; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  commanding him to put a golden diadem on his head, and to mount a horse, and that it should be proclaimed by trumpets preceding him, “Herod is king over the Jews “and the holy city Jerusalem:” which was done. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And returning to Augustus, he rode, and Augustus, and Antony; and they went to Antony’s house, who had invited the senate and all the citizens of Rome to a banquet which he had prepared. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they did eat and drink, and rejoiced over Herod with great joy, making with him a treaty engraven in tables of brass; and it was placed in the temples. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they inscribed that day as the first of Herod’s reign, and from that time it was taken for an zera, by which times are counted. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  After these things, Antony and Herod departed by sea with a great and abundant army: and when they came to Antioch, they divided their forces: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and Antony took a part, and led it into the country of the Persians which is Herak” and the parts adjacent: and Herod, taking another part, went straight till he came to Ptolemais. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So Antigonus, hearing that Antony had made an expedition into the country of the Persians, and that Herod had reached Ptolemais, marched out from the Holy House to the mountain Sarah‘, to take Josephus, Herod’s brother, and those who were with him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whom he assaulted, and besieged; and having cut off a canal, intercepted the water which flowed down to them: so that thirst prevailed among them, and their affairs were reduced to great straits. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Wherefore Josephus determined to flee; and the families had deliberated upon surrendering themselves to Antigonus, if Josephus should flee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But God sent to them an abundant rain, which filled all their cisterns and vessels: wherefore their hearts were encouraged, and their condition was improved; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and Josephus continued to repulse Antony and his men from the strong hold, nor could the latter gain any advantage over him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But Herod marched straight to the mountain Sarah, to bring back his brother, and the families, and the men who were with him, to Jeru. salem. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he found Antigonus besieging his brother; upon whom he made a sudden attack; and Josephus and his men came out to them, and the greater part of Antigonus’ army was destroyed, and he fled into Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Whom Herod pursued with a great army of Jews, who had come to him from every quarter, when they found that he had returned; and he was well supplied with assistance, so that he stood in less need of the army of the Romans. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  When therefore Herod had reached the Holy City, An_ tigonus shut the gates in his face; and fought against him; and sent much money to the chiefs of the army of the Romans, requesting them not to assist Herod: which they did for him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Wherefore the war lasted a long time between Antigonus and Herod, neither of them prevailing over his fellow [i.e. antagonist ]. </p>
