<p> <i>An account of the things which were done to the Sadducees by the Pharisees in the time of Alexandra.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  There was among the Sadducees a chief man, who had been promoted by Alexander, named Diogenes, who formerly had induced him to slay eight hundred men of the Pharisees. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Therefore the leaders of the Pharisees come to Alexandra, and remind her of what Diogenes had done, asking her leave to slay him; which she gave: and they, having it, slew many Sadducees together with him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Which the Sadducees taking very much to heart, went to Aristobulus; and, taking him with them, went to the queen, and said to her: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “You are aware what terrible and heavy things we have undergone, and the many wars and battles which we have fought, in aid of Alexander and his father Hyrcanus. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wherefore it was not meet to trample on our rights, and to lift up the hand of our enemies over us, and to lower our dignities; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  for a matter of this kind will not be hidden from Hartas and others of your enemies; who have experienced our bravery, and have not been able to resist us, and their hearts have been filled with the fear of us. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When therefore they shall perceive what you have done to us, they will imagine that our hearts are devising plans against you; of which when they shall be certified, trust that they will play false towards you. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Nor will we endure to be killed by the Pharisees, like sheep. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore, either restrain their malice from us, or allow us to go out from the city into some of the towns of Judah.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And she said to them, “Do this, that their annoyance to you may be prevented.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the Sadducees went forth of the city; and their chiefs departed with the men of war who adhered to them; and went with their cattle to those of the towns of Judah which they had selected, and dwelt in them; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and there were joined to them those who were devoted to virtue, (i.e. the Hasdanim.) </p>
