<p> <i>An account of the beginning of the power of the Romans, and of the enlargement of their empire.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  At this same time, of which we have been speaking, the affairs of the Romans began to be exalted: that the great and good God might fulfil that which Daniel the prophet (to whom be peace) had foretold concerning the fourth empire. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  There was also at this time a certain most munificent king in Africa, whose name was Annibal. And the royal seat of his empire was Carthage. He determined to take possession of the kingdom of the Romans: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  wherefore they united to oppose him; and wars were multiplied between them, so that they fought eighteen? battles in the space of ten years; and they were not able to drive him out of their country, by reason of his innumerable army and people. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They determined therefore to raise a large force selected from their bravest troops and armies, and to attack Annibal in war, and to persevere until they should turn away his forces from them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Which thing truly they did: and they placed at the head of their armies two most renowned men; the name of one was Aimilius, and of the other Varro. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Who meeting Annibal engaged with him; and there were slain of their army ninety thousand men; and of Annibalâ€™s army forty thousand men were slain. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Varro fled into a certain very large and strong city called Venusia: him Annibal did not pursue; but he marched to Rome, to take it, and there to remain. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So he lay before it for eight days, and began to build houses opposite to it; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  which when the citizens saw, they deliberated on entering into a peace and treaty with him, and on surrendering the country. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But there was among them a certain young man named Scipio, (for the Romans at that time were without a king, and the entire administration of their affairs was committed to three hundred and twenty men, over whom presided a person who was called senior or elder.) </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Scipio therefore comes to these, and persuaded them not to trust to Annibal nor to submission to him. To whom they answered, that they did not trust him, but that they were unable to resist him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To whom he said; the country of Africa is wholly destitute of soldiers, because that they are all here with Annibal: give me therefore a troop of chosen men, that I may go into Africa: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and I will perform such feats in it, that when tidings of them shall reach him, perhaps he will quit you, and you will be freed from him, and will be in peace: and having retrieved and strengthened your resources, if he should prepare to return, you will be able to oppose him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the advice of Scipio appeared to them to be right; and they committed to him thirty thousand of their bravest men. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he proceeded into Africa. And Asdrubal the brother of Annibal met him, and fought with him; whom Scipio defeated, and cut off his head, and took it, with the rest of the prey, and returned to Rome. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And mounting upon the rampart, he called to Annibal, and said: How will you be able to prevail against this our country, when you are not able to expel me from your own land, to which I have gone: I have destroyed it, and have killed your brother, and have brought away his head. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then he threw the head to him. Which being brought to Annibal and recognised by him, he was increased in fury and anger against the people, and sware that he would not depart till he had taken Rome. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But the citizens, to withdraw him from them, and keep him in check, took counsel to send back Scipio to besiege and attack Carthage. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And Scipio returned with his army into Africa: and they pitched their camp around Carthage, and besieged it with a most active siege. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Wherefore the inhabitants wrote to Annibal, saying, You are coveting a foreign country, which you know not whether you will be able to win or not: but there has come to your own country one who is endeavouring to gain possession of it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Wherefore, if you delay coming, we will surrender to him the country, and will give up your family and all your substance and your treasures; that we and our property may go unhurt. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Now when this letter was brought to him, he departed from Rome; and hastened till he came into Africa: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and Scipio went forward and met him, and fought a most fierce battle with him three times, and there were slain fifty thousand of his men. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But Annibal, being put to flight, retired into the land of Egypt; whom Scipio pursued, and took him prisoner, and returned to Africa. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And when he was there, Annibal disdained to be seen by the Africans; wherefore he took poison and died. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Scipio won the country of Africa, and possessed himself of all the goods, and servants, and treasures of Annibal. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  By which means the fame of the Romans was magnified, and their power from that time began to receive increase. </p>
