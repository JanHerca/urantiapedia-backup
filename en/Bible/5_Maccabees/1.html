<p> <i>The attempt of Heliodorus on the treasury. Ir was ordained by the kings of the Grecian</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  It was ordained by the kings of the Grecian Gentiles that large sums of money should be sent into the holy city’ every year, and should be delivered to the priests, that they might add it to the treasury of the house of God, as money for the receivers of alms [orphans ] and for widows. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Now Seleucus was king in Macedonia: and he had a friend, one of his captains, who was called Heliodorus. This man was sent to spoil the treasury, and to take whatever money was therein. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When this was noised abroad, it created great grief among the citizens; and they were afraid lest Heliodorus should proceed to greater lengths; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  as they had not sufficient power to prevent him from executing his orders. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wherefore they all fly to God ,for aid, and ordained a general fast, and supplicated with humility, bowing of the knees, and great wailing; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  putting on sackcloth, and rolling themselves in ashes, with Onias the high priest and the other princes — and elders, even to the common people, and women and children. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And on the next day Heliodorus came into the house of God, with a train of followers; and entered into the house with his foot soldiers, he himself being on horseback, and was in search of the money. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But the great and good God sent a loud, terrible voice upon him; and he saw a person armed with weapons of war, riding on a large horse, and advancing against him: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  wherefore he was seized with fear and trembling: and that person came up to him, and pulled him off from his saddle, and struck him with violence to the earth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So that being exceedingly terror-struck, and frightened out of his senses, he became dumb. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But when his attendants saw what had befallen him, and could perceive no one who had done these things unto him, they carried him with all haste down to his own house: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and he remained during several days, neither speaking nor taking any food. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Wherefore the chief men of his friends went to Onias the priest, beseeching him to be appeased towards him, and to implore the great and good God that He would not punish him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Which thing Onias did; and Heliodorus was healed of his disease. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he saw in a vision the person, whom he had seen in the sanctuary, commanding him to go to Onias the priest, and to salute him, and pay him becoming honour; telling him, that the great and good God had heard his prayers, and had healed him at Onias’ request. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Heliodorus therefore hastened to Onias the priest, whom falling down he saluted; and gave him money of various kinds!, requesting him to add it to that which was in the treasury. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then he went from Jerusalem into the country of Macedonia, and related to king Seleucus what had happened to him; entreating that he would not compel him to become his representative at Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Wherefore the king wondered at the things which Heliodorus mentioned to him; and commanded him to publish them to the world. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And he took care that his men should be removed and sent away from Jerusalem, increasing the gifts which he used to send thither annually, on account of what had befallen Heliodorus. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the kings added more to the money which they ordered to be given to the priests, that it might be spent on the orphans and widows; also to that which was to be spent on the sacrifices. </p>
