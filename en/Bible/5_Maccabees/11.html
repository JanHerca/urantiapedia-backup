<p> <i>The relation of the batile between Judas and Lysias the general of Eupator, after the death of king Antiochus</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The name of Antiochus, of whom mention has been made above, was Epiphanius: but the name of his son who reigned after him was Eupator, who also was named Antiochus. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when the battles of Judas with these generals had taken place, they» wrote on the subject to Eupator; who sent with Lysias, his cousin’s son, a large army, in which were eighty thousand horsemen and eighty elephants. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who coming to a city which is called Bethner, pitched their camp around it, and besieged it, because it was a large city, and much people was therein. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Lysias raised engines of war around it, and began to besiege the inhabitants: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  which being told to Judas, he himself and his company went out to some fortified mountains; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and there they abode; lest if they remained in any city, Lysias should come and besiege it, and should overpower them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Judas therefore collected his company, and resolved to march with them to Lysias’ camp, after they should have gone to the house of God and offered sacrifices in it; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  beseeching the great and good God to turn away from them the malice of their enemies, and to grant them victory over them: which thing they did. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  After this, they marched from the region of the holy house to Bethner. For they had designed to come upon the army suddenly, and to defeat it without a struggle. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now men say, that there appeared to Judas a certain personage between heaven and earth, riding on a fiery-horse, and holding in his hand a large spear, with which he smote the army of the Gentiles. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So that what they had seen gave them additional courage and spirits. And they made haste and charged the army, and slew great numbers of its men. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wherefore the enemy’s army was troubled and thrown into the greatest confusion, and the whole of it betook itself to a confused flight. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the sword of Judas and his company pressed sore upon them; and he slew of them eleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Liysias also was chased, with his company, to a distant place, in which he remained in safety. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he sent to Judas, desiring him to be subject to the king, retaining his own and his people’s religion: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  to whom Judas consented in this matter, until word could be written to the king, and an answer of his agreeing thereto could be received. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Judas wrote concerning this business: Lysias also wrote to the king, informing him of what had happened, and what proof he had had of the strength and bravery of the Jewish nation; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and that a continuation of wars with them would exterminate his men, as these beforementioned had been exterminated: he told him also their agreement, and his own waiting until he should receive a letter to say what he must do. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  To whom the king replied, that it seemed right to him to make peace with the nation of the Jews, taking away that stumblingblock concerning the exercise of their religion: for that this very thing had incited them to the revolts, and to the attacks made on his predecessors. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He also commanded him to make with them a treaty of peace and obedience; so that no obstacles should be thrown in their way in the matter of religion. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He wrote also to Judas, and to all the Jews who were in the land of Judah, according to this effect: and this peace continued between them for some space of time. </p>
