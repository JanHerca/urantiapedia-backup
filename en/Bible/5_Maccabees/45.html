<p> <i>The history of Cesar’s death</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  There were with Cesar two of Pompey’s friends; of whom the one was called Cassius, and the other Brutus; who laid a plot to kill Cesar. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For which purpose they concealed themselves in the temple? at Rome which he had set apart for himself to pray in. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To which therefore when he came, careless, safe, and taking no sort of heed to himself, they rushed upon him, and killed him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Cassius got possession of the throne, and gathered a large army, and transported it beyond the sea; fearing Caesar’s party if he should continue to reside at Rome. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he marched into the land of Asia, and wasted it: from thence he went into the country of Judah: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and Antipater wished to attack him; but seeing that his strength was not equal to the task, he made peace with him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Cassius laid a tribute of seven hundred talents of gold on the land of Judah; and Antipater bound himself as surety for the money; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and charged his son Herod to raise it on the country of Judah, and to carry it to Cassius: who receiving it marched into the country of Macedonia, and there remained through fear of the Romans. </p>
