<p> <i>The history of Judas’ battles with Gorgias and Ptolemy</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now after the days of dedication, Judas marched into the country of the Idumzans, to the mountain Sarah for Gorgias was staying there. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Gorgias went out against him with a great army, and there were sore battles betwixt them; and there fell of Gorgias’ men twenty thou sand. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Gorgias fled to Ptolemy into the land of the west, (for Antiochus had made him governor of that country, and there he was staying,) and told him what had befallen him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whereupon Ptolemy went forth with an army, in which were a hundred and twenty thousand men of Macedonia and the east. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he went on until he came to the country of Giares, (that is to say, Gilead,) and the parts adjacent; and he slew great numbers of the Jews. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So they wrote to Judas, telling him what had happened to them, begging him to come and defeat Ptolemy and drive him away from them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And their ‘letter reached him at the same time that a letter came to him from the inhabitants of the mountain of Galilee I likewise, informing him how the Macedonians; who were at Tyre and Sidon had now united against them, and had attacked them, killing several. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Now when Judas had read both the letters, he called together his men, and shewed them the contents of the letters, and appointed a fast and supplication. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  After this, he ordered his brother Simeon to take with him three thousand men of the Jews, and to march with all speed to the mountain of Galilee, «and to quell the Macedonians who were there. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Simeon went. But Judas hastened to encounter Ptolemy. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Simeon attacked the Macedonians unexpectedly, and slew of them eight thousand men, and gave rest to the Galilzans. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But Judas marched on until he came up with Gorgias and Ptolemy; pressing them and besieging them: and the two armies encountered, and very fierce battles took place betwixt them. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For Ptolemy headed a numerous, stout, and brave body of men. But Judas was accompanied by a very small band: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  yet, as the people who were with him consisted of the bravest and strongest troops, he steadily resisted, and the battle between them lasted long, and grew very sore. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Wherefore Judas called out to the great and good God, and invoked his aid. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he related that he had seen five youthful horsemen, three of whom fought against Ptolemy’s army, and two stood near him self. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Whom when he viewed attentively, they seemed to him to be angels of God. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Wherefore his heart was comforted, and the hearts of his companions; and making frequent assaults upon the enemy, they put them to flight, and slew great multitudes of them. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the number of those who were slain of Ptolemy’s army, from the beginning of this battle until the end, was twenty thousand and five hundred. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  After these things, Ptolemy and his men fled to the sea-coast; while Judas pursued them, and slew as many of them as he caught. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But Ptolemy fled to Gaza, and remained there; and the men of Chalisam came to him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Judas marched against them; and when he found them, he defeated them: and Ptolemy’s men were dispersed, but he himself fled to Gaza, and there fortified himself. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Judas’ men pursued the flying body, and slew great numbers of them. And Judas and the men who were with him marched straight to Gaza, and he pitched his camp and besieged it. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Judas’ men returned to him; and they who were left of Ptolemy’s forces went up upon the fortification, and abused Judas with much reviling. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And the fighting between them and Judas’ troops lasted for five days. But when the fifth day was come, the people continued to cast reproaches upon Judas, and to revile his religion: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  whereupon twenty of Judas’ men grew angry; who taking shields on their left hands, and swords in their right, and having with them a man bearing a ladder which they had made, marched until they came to the wall: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  and eighteen of them stood and threw darts at those who were on the wall; and two, hastening to the wall, raised up the ladder, and by it mounted. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But certain of those who were there, perceiving that they had ascended, and that their companions had followed, and also had gone down from the wall into the city, descended from the wall after them: whom Judas’ men defeated, slaying great numbers of their enemies. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But the army of Judas pressed forward to the gate of the city; and the twenty began to run toward the gate that they might open it: but they were driven thence most fiercely; wherefore they called out with loud cries. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Judas therefore and his men knew that they had come near to the gate: and the battle grew sore both without the gate and within. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And Judas and his men attacked the gate with fire, and it fell down; and the people perished, and the men who had reviled Judas, were taken, and he commanded them to be brought out and burned. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Moreover he commanded the city to be utterly smitten with the sword; and the slaughter continued in it for two days, and then it was wasted with fire. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  But Ptolemy fled; nor were tidings of him heard at that time; because that he had changed his clothes, and concealed himself in one of the pits , and no account of him was had. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  But his two brothers were taken, and brought to Judas; and he ordered them to be beheaded. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  After this he went into the land of the sanctuary, with abundance of spoil; and both he and his company offered prayers therein, giving thanks to God for the benefits which they had received. </p>
