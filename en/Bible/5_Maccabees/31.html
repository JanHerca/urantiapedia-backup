<p> <i>The history of queen Alexandra</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now while Alexandra reigned, she called to her the chief men of the Pharisees, and commanded them to write to all those of their sect who had fled into Egypt and other parts, in the days of Hyrcanus and of Alexander, that they should return into the land of Judah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And she shewed them her favourable inclination towards them, and did not oppose herself to their rites, nor forbid their ceremonies, as Alexander and Hyrcanus had forbidden them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  She also released all of them who were detained in prison. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they came together from every quarter; and the Sadducees forbore offering them any violence. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And their affairs were well ordered, and their condition became improved by the removal of quarrels. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But when Hyrcanus and Aristobulus the two sons of Alexander grew up, the queen made Hyrcanus high priest, for he was meek, mild, and honest: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but Aristobulus she made general of the army, for he was stout, brave, and high-spirited; and she also gave to him the army of the Sadducees: but she did not think it meet to appoint him king, as he was still a boy. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Moreover she sent to all those who paid tribute to Alexander, and took their kingsâ€™ sons, whom she detained near her as hostages; and they continued uninterruptedly in their obedience to her, paying tribute every year. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And she walked uprightly with her people, distributing justice, and commanding her people to do the same. Wherefore there was a lasting peace between the parties, and she gained their good-will. </p>
