<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  “From the elder, and his three hundred_and twenty governors, to Hyrcanus the king of Judah, health. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Your letter has even now reached us, on reading which we rejoiced; and we have questioned your ambassadors concerning the state of your affairs. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Also we have acknowledged their place of dignity in science, moral discipline, and the virtues; and we have honoured them, and made them sit in the presence of our elder: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  who has been careful to transact all their business, giving command that all the cities which Antiochus had taken away by force should be restored to you; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and that every obstacle to the exercise of your religion should be removed; and that all should be made void which Antiochus had decreed against you. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He has also commanded thatall the cities which he had taken should continue faithful for you; he has likewise given orders by letter to all his provinces, that your ambassadors should be treated with respect and honour. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Moreover he has sent with them an ambassador to you named Cynzeus, bearing a letter; to whom also he has entrusted an embassy, that he might treat with you in person.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore when this epistle of the Romans had reached Hyrcanus, he began to be styled king, being formerly called high priest: and thus the royal and sacerdotal dignities were united in him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he was the first who was called king among the chiefs of the Jews in the time of the second house. </p>
