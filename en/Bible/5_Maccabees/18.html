<p> <i>The history of Jonathan the son of Mattathias</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jonathan succeeded his brother, and he went to Jordan with a small number of men; which when Bacchides heard of, he marched to him with a large army. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when Jonathan saw him, his men swam over Jordan; and Bacchides and his army followed them, and surrounded them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Jonathan rushed on Bacchides; and as the men gave way to Jonathan, he and his company went out from the midst of them, and departed to Beersheba: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and his brother Simeon joined him, and they abode there; and they repaired whatever of the fortifications had fallen down, and they fortified themselves there. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But Bacchides marched to them, and besieged them: and Jonathan and his brother, and they which were with them, went out to him by night, and slew great numbers of his army, and burned the battering rams.and engines of war; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and his army was dispersed, and Bacchides fled into the desert. And Jonathan and Simeon, and the men who were with him, pursued and took him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Who, when he saw Jonathan, knew that his death was near: wherefore he proclaimed peace with Jonathan, and sware that he would never more make war upon him, and moreover, that he would restore the whole of the captives which he had taken of the army of Judas. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Jonathan gave him his hand, and departed from him: nor after this was there any more war between them. And not long after this, Jonathan died, and his brother Simeon succeeded him. </p>
