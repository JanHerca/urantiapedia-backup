<p> <i>The history of the murder which Herod committed on his wife Mariamne.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Josephus, the husband of Herod’s sister, had revealed to Mariamne that Herod had ordered him to put her and her mother to death, as soon as he himself should perish in his going up to Augustus. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And she already had a dislike of Herod, since the time when he killed her father and brother; and to this no little addition of hatred was made, when she was informed of the orders which he had given against her. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore when Herod arrived out of Egypt, he found her totally overcome by hatred towards him: at which being greatly troubled, he tried to reconcile her to him by all possible methods. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But his sister came on a certain day, after some quarrels which had taken place between her and Mariamne, and said to him, Certainly Joseph my husband has gone aside with Mariamne. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But Herod paid no attention to her words, knowing how pure and chaste Mariamne was. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  After this, Herod went to see Mariamne on the night which followed that day, and behaved kindly and affectionately towards her, recounting his love for her, saying much upon this head: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  to whom she said, “Did you ever see a man love another, and order him to be put to death? and is he a hater unless he shews such proofs?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Herod perceived that Josephus had discovered to Mariamne the secret which he had entrusted to him; and believed that he would not have done that, unless she had given herself up to him: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and he believed that which his sister had told him on this subject; and immediately departing from Mariamne, he hated and detested her. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Which his sister learning, went to the cupbearer, and giving him money, delivered to him some poison, and said; Carry this to the king, and say to him, Mariamne the king’s wife gave me this poison, and this money, commanding that it might be mixed in the king’s drink. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  This the cupbearer did. And the king seeing the poison, doubted not of the truth of the thing: whereupon he gives orders to behead Josephus his brother-inlaw immediately; and also orders Mariamne to be put in chains, until the_seventy elders should be present, and should pass a due sentence upon her. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So Herod’s sister feared, lest what she had done should be discovered, and she herself should perish, if Mariamne were set free: so she said to him, O king, if you put off Mariamne’s death till to-morrow, you will not be at all able to effect it: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for as soon as it shall become known that you wish to kill her, the whole house of her father will come, and all their servants and neighbours, and will interpose; and you will not be able to obtain her death until after great tumults. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Herod said, Do as it seems best to you. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Herod’s sister sent in all haste a man to bring out Mariamne to the place of slaughter, setting upon her her maids, and other women, to insult her, and upbraid her with all manner of indecency: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  but she answered nothing to any of them, nor even moved her head in the least: nor was her colour changed by all this treatment, nor did any fear or confusion appear in her, nor was her gait altered; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but with her wonted manner she proceeded to the place whither she was led to be slain; and bending her knees, she held out her neck voluntarily: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and departed this life, renowned for religion and chastity, marked by ‘no crime, branded with no guilt; howbeit she was not wholly free from haughtiness, according to the habit of her family. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And of this not the least cause was the obsequious attention and affection of Herod towards her, by reason of the elegance of her form; from whence she suspected no change in him towards her. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Now Herod had begotten of her two sons, namely, Alexander and Aristobulus; who, when their mother was slain, were living at Rome; for he had sent them thither, to learn the literature and language of the Romans. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Afterwards, Herod repented that he had killed his wife; and he was affected with grief to that degree on account of her death, that by it he contracted a disease, of which he had nearly died. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Mariamne being dead, her mother Alexandra laid plans to put Herod to death; which coming to his knowledge, he made away with her. </p>
