<p> <i>The history of the Jews. A relation of what befell the Jews under king Antiochus; and what battles took place between them and his captains; and to what lengths he at last proceeded.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  There was a certain man of the kings of Macedon, who was called Antiochus; among whose deeds was this: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that when Ptolemy the abovementioned king of Egypt was dead, he went with his armies to attack the second Ptolemy. And, having conquered and slain Ptolemy, he won his country? Egypt, and took possession of it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  From hence, as his affairs gained an accession of strength, he subdued a great part of the earth; the king of Persia and others paying him obedience. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wherefore his heart was lifted up: and being puffed up with pride, he commanded images to be made after his own likeness; that men should worship them, to his glorifying and honour. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when these were made, he sent messengers into all the regions of his empire, commanding them to be worshipped and adored. T’o these commands the nations assented, fearing and dreading his tyranny. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now there were at that time in Judea three men, the very worst of all mortals; and each of them had, as it were, a connexion in the same sort of vice. The name of one of these three was Menelaus; of the second, Simeon; of the third, Alcimus. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And about that time there appeared" certain images, which the citizens of Jerusalem beheld in the air for the space of forty days: they were the appearances of men riding on fiery horses fighting with each other. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So those impious men went to Antiochus, to obtain from him some authority, that they might perpetrate with ease whatever they wished, of whoredom, and plundering of men’s goods; and in short, might rule over the rest, and might keep them in subjection. And they said to him, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “O king, there have appeared lately in the air over Jerusalem fiery horsemen, contending with each other: and on that account the Hebrews have rejoiced, saying, “that this portended the death of king Antiochus.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Which words the king believing, being filled with rage, he marched to Jerusalem in the shortest possible time; and came upon the nation not at all forewarned of his approach. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And his men attacked the inhabitants, and slew them with the sword, making a very great slaughter; many also they wounded, and a great multitude they led into captivity. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But some escaping fled into the mountains and woods, where they continued a long time, feeding upon herbs. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  After this, Antiochus determined to depart from the country. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But the evil which he had done to the nation did not suffice him: but he left as his substitute a man named Felix, enjoining him to compel the Jews to worship his image, and to eat swine’s flesh. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Which Felix did, sending for the people to obey the king in the things which he had commanded him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But they refused to do the things whereunto they were called; wherefore he slew a great multitude of them; preserving those wicked orn and their family, and raising their dignity. </p>
