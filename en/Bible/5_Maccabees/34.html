<p> <i>The account of Aristobulus’ attack on his brother Hyrcanus, after Alexandra’s death.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Aristobulus departed from Jerusalem in the days of Alexandra, he left his wife and children in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But when the news of his departure reached Alexandra, she confined them in a certain house, setting a guard over them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But when Alexandra was dead, Hyrcanus called them to him, and behaved kindly to them, and took care of them; that they might deliver him from his brother, if haply he should conquer him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Aristobulus led out a great army as far as to Jordan; and Hyrcanus went out against him with an army of Pharisees. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when the two armies had encountered, great numbers of Hyrcanus’ army were slain; and Hyrcanus, and the remainder of his army, took to flight. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whom Aristobulus and his troops pursuing, slew every one whom they caught, excepting those who surrendered themselves. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then Hyrcanus retreated into the Holy City; whither also arrived Aristobulus and his army; and he surrounded it on every side with his tents, and attempted by stratagem to destroy the fortification. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the elders of Judah, and the elders of the priests, went out to him, and forbade his doing what he had designed; requesting him to dismiss from his mind whatever hostile feeling he had towards his brother: to which proposal he assented. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then it was agreed between them that Aristobulus should be king over Judah, and Hyrcanus should be high priest” in the house of God, and next to the king dignity. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Aristobulus assented to these terms, and entered the city, and had an interview with his brother in the house of God; and they took an oath together to ratify those terms which the elders had mutually agreed on. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So Aristobulus was made king, and Hyrcanus was ranked next unto him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And men were at peace, and the affairs of these two brothers were rightly ordered, and the state of their people and of their country became one of tranquillity. </p>
