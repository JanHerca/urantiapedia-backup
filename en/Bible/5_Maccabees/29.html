<p> <i>An account of the battles which took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Afterwards evils arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and continued by the space of six years. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Alexander helped the Sadducees against the Pharisees, of whom there were slain within six years fifty thousand. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore between these two sects the state of things was reduced to utter destruction, and their enmity was completely confirmed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So Alexander, having sent for the elder men of each sect, spake kindly to them, and advised a reconciliation. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But they answered him, “In truth you, in our opinion, are worthy of death, for the abundance of innocent blood which you have shed: wherefore let there be nothing between us but the sword.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then after this, they began to shew their enmity openly, sending messengers to Demetrius the king of Macedon, that he should come to them with an army; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  promising that they would assist him against Alexander and his party, and would reduce the Hebrews to submission to the Macedonians. And Demetrius marched to them with a large army. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Which also was told to Alexander; who sent a person to hire six thousand Macedonians, whom joining to his own forces he advanced against Demetrius. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Many also of the Jews, Pharisees, went over to Demetrius. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Demetrius sent secretly persons to those Macedonians who were with Alexander, to seduce them from him; but they hearkened not unto him. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Alexander also sent secretly men to the Jews who were with Demetrius, to turn them to his side; but neither did these do as he would have them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Alexander and Demetrius met, and fought a battle; in which all Alexander’s men fell, and he escaped alone into the land of Judah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But when his men heard it whispered that he had escaped in safety, and found out the place where he was; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  there assembled unto him about six thousand men of the bravest of the sons of Israel; and many of those, who had revolted to Demetrius, joined themselves to him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Afterwards men flocked to him from every side; and he returned to give battle to Demetrius with a numerous force, and put him to flight: and Demetrius returned into his own country. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Alexander marched against him to Antioch, and besieged it three years: and po when Demetrius came out to fight, Alexander conquered him and slew him: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and he departed from the city, and returned to Jerusalem to his citizens; who magnified him, honouring and praising him for having defeated his enemies. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the Jews agreed to submit to him, and his heart was at rest: and he sent his armies against all his enemies, whom he put to flight, and gained the victory over them. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He also gained possession of the mountains of Sarah, and the country of Ammon, and Moab, and the country of the Philistines, and all the parts which were in the hands of the Arabians who fought with him, even to the bounds of the desert. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the affairs of his kingdom were ruled aright; and he placed his people and his country in a state of safety. </p>
