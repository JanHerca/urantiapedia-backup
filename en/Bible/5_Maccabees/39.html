<p> <i>The history of Gabinius and of Alexander the son of Aristobulus.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Gabinius had gone out from Rome, to dwell in the land of Syria, to take care of it; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and it was told him what Alexander the son of Aristobulus had done, by building up that which Pompey had pulled down, and by opposing his successor, and slaying his friends. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore he went straight until he came to Jerusalem; and Hyrcanus and his party joined him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Against whom Alexander went out with ten thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse, and encountered them: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and they routed him, and slew a certain number of his friends; and he fled into a certain city in the land of Judah, called Alexandrium , in which he fortified himself with his company. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Hyrcanus, and Gabinius, and their forces, marched against him and_ besieged him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Alexander went out against them, and engaged them, and slew great numbers of their men. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Marcus, who is called Antonius, marched against him, and forced him to flee again into Alexandrium. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Alexanderâ€™s mother went out to Gabinius, deprecating his anger, and imploring him to grant her son Alexander his life: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  to whom Gabinius assented in this point; and Alexander went out to him; and Gabinius put him to death; and thought proper to divide the territories of Judah into five portions. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  One is, the country of Jerusalem and the parts adjacent; and over this part Hyrcanus was made governor. Another portion is Gadira, and the places about it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The third is, Jericho and the plains. The fourth is, Hamath in the land of Judah. And the fifth is, Sephoris. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  By these means he intended to remove wars and seditions out of the land of Judah; but they were by no means removed. </p>
