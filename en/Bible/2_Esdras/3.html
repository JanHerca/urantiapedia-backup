<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion? </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob? </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments? </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen. </p>
