<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The same must know it after death by pain. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then answered I and said, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Like as a wave is greater than a drop. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;) </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine; </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her, </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind? </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years, </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  And I nourished him with great travail. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast. </p>
