<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And those that be dead will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name in Israel. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight of my clearness. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Keep the old and young within thy walls. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these? </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands? </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen. </p>
