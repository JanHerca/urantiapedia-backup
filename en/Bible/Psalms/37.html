<p> [A Psalm] of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on [his] faithfulness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noon-day. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, [it tendeth] only to evil-doing. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; In smoke shall they consume away. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A man's goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a [happy] end to the man of peace. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; The end of the wicked shall be cut off. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them; He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him. </p>
