<p> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: Set me on high from them that rise up against me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, [say they], doth hear? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [Because of] his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  [For] the sin of their mouth, [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. Selah </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy. </p>
