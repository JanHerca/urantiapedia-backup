<p> For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David, a song. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: Yea, let them rejoice with gladness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; His name is Jehovah; and exult ye before him. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  God setteth the solitary in families: He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious dwell in a parched land. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The earth trembled, The heavens also dropped [rain] at the presence of God: Yon Sinai [trembled] at the presence of God, the God of Israel. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thy congregation dwelt therein: Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The Lord giveth the word: The women that publish the tidings are a great host. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Kings of armies flee, they flee; And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  When ye lie among the sheepfolds, [It is as] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  When the Almighty scattered kings therein, [It was as when] it snoweth in Zalmon. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Why look ye askance, ye high mountains, At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will dwell [in it] for ever. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them, [as in] Sinai, in the sanctuary. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led away captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, [among] the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell [with them]. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  God is unto us a God of deliverances; And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But God will smite through the head of his enemies, The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring [them] again from the depths of the sea; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  That thou mayest crush [them], [dipping] thy foot in blood, That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from [thine] enemies. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They have seen thy goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Bless ye God in the congregations, Even the Lord, [ye that are] of the fountain of Israel. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  There is little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah [and] their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Thy God hath commanded thy strength: Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Because of thy temple at Jerusalem Kings shall bring presents unto thee. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; Oh sing praises unto the Lord; Selah </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old; Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  O God, [thou art] terrible out of thy holy places: The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto [his] people. Blessed be God. </p>
