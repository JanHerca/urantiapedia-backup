<p> A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But mine enemies are lively, [and] are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation. </p>
