<p> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him [cometh] my salvation. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay [him], all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be moved. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart [thereon]. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work. </p>
