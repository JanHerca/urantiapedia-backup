<p> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;) </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery [shafts]. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
