<p> For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order [my prayer] unto thee, and will keep watch. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield. </p>
