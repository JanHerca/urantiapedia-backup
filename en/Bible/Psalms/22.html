<p> For the Chief Musician; set to Aijaleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [Why art thou so] far from helping me, [and from] the words of my groaning? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying], </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Commit [thyself] unto Jehovah; Let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust [when I was] upon my mother's breasts. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They gape upon me with their mouth, [As] a ravening and a roaring lion. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I may count all my bones; They look and stare upon me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Save me from the lion's mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For the kingdom is Jehovah's; And he is the ruler over the nations. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the [next] generation. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it. </p>
