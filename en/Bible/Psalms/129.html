<p> A Song of Ascents. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah. </p>
