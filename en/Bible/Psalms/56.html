<p> For the Chief Musician; set to Jonath elem rehokim. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam: when the Philistines took him in Gath. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: All the day long he fighting oppresseth me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In God (I will praise his word), In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In God (I will praise [his] word), In Jehovah (I will praise [his] word), </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do unto me? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank-offerings unto thee. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For thou hast delivered my soul from death: [Hast thou] not [delivered] my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living? </p>
