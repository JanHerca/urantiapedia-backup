<p> [A Psalm] of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever. </p>
