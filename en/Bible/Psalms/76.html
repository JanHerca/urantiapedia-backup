<p> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Glorious art thou [and] excellent, From the mountains of prey. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth. </p>
