<p> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of Asaph. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I said, This is my infirmity; [But I will remember] the years of the right hand of the Most High. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron. </p>
