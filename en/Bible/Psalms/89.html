<p> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. Selah </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  In thy name do they rejoice all the day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For thou art the glory of their strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah; And our king to the Holy One of Israel. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I have found David my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  With whom my hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be exalted. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  I also will make him [my] first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If his children forsake my law, And walk not in mine ordinances; </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  If they break my statutes, And keep not my commandments; </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  My covenant will I not break, Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  It shall be established for ever as the moon, And [as] the faithful witness in the sky. Selah </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  But thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: Thou hast profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  All that pass by the way rob him: He is become a reproach to his neighbors. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  The days of his youth hast thou shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? [How long] shall thy wrath burn like fire? </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men! </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness? </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] all the mighty peoples, </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen. </p>
