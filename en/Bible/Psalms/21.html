<p> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou hast given him his heart's desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power. </p>
