<p> For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. Selah </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come, and see the works of God; [He is] terrible in his doing toward the children of men. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me. </p>
