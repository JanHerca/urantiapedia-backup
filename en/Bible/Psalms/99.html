<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth [above] the cherubim; let the earth be moved. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The king's strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy. </p>
