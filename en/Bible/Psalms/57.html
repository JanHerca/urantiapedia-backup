<p> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until [these] calamities be overpast. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth [all things] for me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He will send from heaven, and save me, [When] he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth. </p>
