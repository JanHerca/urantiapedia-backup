<p> A Psalm. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity. </p>
