<p> A Prayer of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, [and] hear my speech. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge [in thee ]From those that rise up [against them]. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast [us] down to the earth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in [this] life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with [beholding] thy form. </p>
