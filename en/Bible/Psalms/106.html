<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] forever. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then believed they his words; They sang his praise. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They envied Moses also in the camp, [And] Aaron the saint of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt, </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [And] terrible things by the Red Sea. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them]. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word, </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works, </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry: </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah. </p>
