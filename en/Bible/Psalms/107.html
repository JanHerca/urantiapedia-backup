<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let the redeemed of Jehovah say [so], Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth [them] from their destructions. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men! </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground; </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation, </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh [him] families like a flock. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah. </p>
