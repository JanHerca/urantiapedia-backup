<p> A Song of Ascents. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel. </p>
