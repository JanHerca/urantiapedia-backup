<p> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after thee, O God. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And [why] art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him [For] the help of his countenance. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O my God, my soul is cast down within me: Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  [Yet] Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with me, [Even] a prayer unto the God of my life. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, [Who is] the help of my countenance, and my God. </p>
