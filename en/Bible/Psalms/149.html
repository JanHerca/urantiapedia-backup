<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [Let] the high praises of God [be] in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah. </p>
