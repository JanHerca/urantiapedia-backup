<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp. </p>
