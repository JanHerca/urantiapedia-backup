<p> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; and when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries. </p>
