<p> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, [cometh] lifting up. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. </p>
