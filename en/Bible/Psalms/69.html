<p> For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshanim. [A Psalm] of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother's children. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They that sit in the gate talk of me; And [I am] the song of the drunkards. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep shallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, [let it become] a trap. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, [Or] a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein. </p>
