<p> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad. </p>
