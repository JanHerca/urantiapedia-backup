<p> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial [name] unto all generations. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee. </p>
