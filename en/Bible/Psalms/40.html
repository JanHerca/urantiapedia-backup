<p> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll of the book it is written of me: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea, thy law is within my heart. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Jehovah, thou knowest. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For innumerable evils have compassed me about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say unto me, Aha, aha. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But I am poor and needy; [Yet] the Lord thinketh upon me: Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God. </p>
