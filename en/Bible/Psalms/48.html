<p> A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, The city of the great King. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They saw it, then were they amazed; They were dismayed, they hasted away. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of thy temple. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As is thy name, O God, So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of thy judgments. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Walk about Zion, and go round about her; Number the towers thereof; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Mark ye well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces: That ye may tell it to the generation following. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our guide [even] unto death. </p>
