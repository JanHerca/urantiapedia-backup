<p> A Psalm of Asaph. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations. </p>
