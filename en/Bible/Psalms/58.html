<p> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: [They are] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  [Let them be] as a snail which melteth and passeth away, [Like] the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth. </p>
