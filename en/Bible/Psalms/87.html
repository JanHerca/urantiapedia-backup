<p> A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  His foundation is in the holy mountains. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. Selah </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They that sing as well as they that dance [shall say], All my fountains are in thee. </p>
