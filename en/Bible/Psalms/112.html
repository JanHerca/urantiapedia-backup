<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: [He is] gracious, and merciful, and righteous. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see [his desire] upon his adversaries. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish. </p>
