<p> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, [say they], a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory. </p>
