<p> For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon God? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad. </p>
