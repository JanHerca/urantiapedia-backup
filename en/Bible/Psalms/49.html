<p> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Both low and high, Rich and poor together. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever;) </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Their inward thought is, [that] their houses [shall continue] for ever, [And] their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But man [being] in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,) </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish. </p>
