<p> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Abimelech. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God [endureth] continually. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou lovest all devouring words, thou deceitful tongue. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. Selah </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The righteous also shall see [it], and fear, And shall laugh at him, [saying], </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints. </p>
