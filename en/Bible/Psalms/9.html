<p> For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Jehovah sitteth [as king] for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction [which I suffer] of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah </p>
