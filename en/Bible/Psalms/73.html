<p> A Psalm of Asaph. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Surely God is good to Israel, [Even] to such as are pure in heart. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They are not in trouble as [other] men; Neither are they plagued like [other] men. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full [cup] are drained by them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was [as] a beast before thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  My flesh and my heart faileth; [But] God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, [departing] from thee. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works. </p>
