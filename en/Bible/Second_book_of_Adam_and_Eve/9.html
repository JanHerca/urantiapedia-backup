<p> <i>The death of Adam.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN Adam had ended his commandment to Seth, his limbs were loosened, his hands and feet lost all power, his mouth became dumb, and his tongue ceased altogether to speak. He closed his eyes and gave up the ghost. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But when his children saw that he was dead, they threw themselves over him, men and women, old and young, weeping. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The death of Adam took place at the end of nine hundred and thirty years that be lived upon the earth; on the fifteenth day of Barmudeh, after the reckoning of an epact of the sun, at the ninth hour. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  It was on a Friday, the very day on which be was created, and on which he rested; and the hour at which he died, was the same as that at which he came out of the garden. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Seth wound him up well, and embalmed him with plenty of sweet spices, from sacred trees and from the Holy Mountain; and be laid his body on the eastern side of the inside of the cave, the side of the incense; and placed in front of him a lamp-stand kept burning. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then his children stood before him weeping and wailing over him the whole night until break of day. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then Seth and big son Enos, and Cainan, the son of Enos, went out and took good offerings to present unto the Lord, and they came to the altar upon which Adam offered gifts to God, when he did offer. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But Eve said to them “Wait until we have first asked God to accept our offering, and to keep by Him the Soul of Adam His servant, and to take it up to rest.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they all stood up an prayed. </p>
