<p> <i>Only three righteous men left in the world. The evil conditions of men prior to the Flood.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BUT Enoch kept the commandment of Jared his father, and continued to minister in the cave. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  It is this Enoch to whom many wonders happened, and who also wrote a celebrated book; but those wonders may not be told in this place. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then after this, the children of Seth went astray and fell, they, their children and their wives. And when Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Noah saw them, their hearts suffered by reason of their fall into doubt full of unbelief; and they wept and sought of God mercy, to preserve them, and to bring them out of that wicked generation. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Enoch continued in his ministry before the Lord three hundred and eighty-five years, and at the end of that time he became aware through the grace of God, that God intended to remove him from the earth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He then said to his son, "O my son, I know that God intends to bring the waters of the Flood upon the earth, and to destroy our creation. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “And ye are the last rulers over this people on this mountain; for I know that not one will be left you to beget children on this holy mountain; neither shall any one of you rule over the children of his people; neither shall any great company be left of you, on this mountain.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Enoch said also to them, "Watch over your souls, and hold fast by your fear of God and by your service of Him, and worship Him in upright faith, and serve Him in righteousness, innocence and judgment, in repentance and also in purity." </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When Enoch had ended his commandments to them, God transported him from that mountain to the land of life, to the mansions of the righteous and of the chosen, the abode of Paradise of joy, in light that reaches up to heaven; light that is outside the light of this world; for it is the light of God, that fills the whole world, but which no place can contain. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thus, because Enoch was in the light of God, he found himself out of the reach of death; until God would have him die. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Altogether, not one of our fathers or of their children, remained on that holy mountain, except those three, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah. For all the rest went down from the mountain and fell into sin with the children of Cain. Therefore were they forbidden that mountain, and none remained on it but those three men. </p>
