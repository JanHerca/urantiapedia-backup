<p> <i>Time, like an ever-rolling stream, bears away another generation of men.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN Enos was nine hundred years old, all the children of Seth, and of Cainan, and his first-born, with their wives and children, gathered around him, asking for a blessing from him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He then prayed over them and blessed them, and adjured them by the blood of Abel the just saying to them, “Let not one of your children go down from this Holy Mountain, and let them make no fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Enos called his son Cainan and said to him, “See, O my son, and set thy heart on thy people, and establish them in righteousness, and in innocence; and stand ministering before the body of our father Adam, all the days of thy life.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  After this Enos entered into rest, aged nine hundred and eighty-five years; and Cainan wound him up, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures on the left of his father Adam; and made offerings for him, after the custom of his fathers. </p>
