<p> <i>Confusion in the Cave of Treasures. Miraculous speech of the dead Adam.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE children of Jared were in the habit of visiting him hour after hour, to receive his blessing and to ask his advice for every thing they did; and when he had a work to do, they did it for him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But this time when they went into the cave they found not Jared, but they found the lamp put out, and the bodies of the fathers thrown about, and voices came from them by the power of God, that said, “Satan in an apparition has deceived our son, wishing to destroy him, as he destroyed our son Cain.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They said also, “Lord God of heaven and earth, deliver our son from the hand of Satan, who wrought a great and false apparition before him,” They also spake of other matters, by the power of God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But when the children of Jared heard these voices they feared, and stood weeping for their father; for they knew not what had befallen him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they wept for him that day until the setting of the sun. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then came Jared with a woeful countenance, wretched in mind and body, and sorrowful at having been separated from the bodies of his fathers. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But as he was drawing near to the cave, his children saw him, and hastened to the cave, and hung upon his neck, crying, and saying to him, “O father, where hast thou been, and why hast thou left us, as thou wast not wont to do?” And again, “O father, when thou didst disappear, the lamp over the bodies of our fathers went out, the bodies were thrown about, and voices came from them.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When Jared heard this he was sorry, and went into the cave; and there found the bodies thrown about, the lamp put out, and the fathers themselves praying for his deliverance from the hand of Satan. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then Jared fell upon the bodies and embraced them, and said, “O my fathers, through your intercession, let God deliver me from the hand of Satan! And I beg you will ask God to keep me and to bide me from him unto the day of my death.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then all the voices ceased save the voice of our father Adam, who spake to Jared by the power of God, just as one would speak to his fellow, saying, "O Jared, my son, offer gifts to God for having delivered thee from the hand of Satan; and when thou bringest those offerings, so be it that thou offerest them on the altar on which I did offer. Then also, beware of Satan; for he deluded me many a time with his apparitions, wishing to destroy me, but God delivered me out of his hand. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “Command thy people that they be on their guard against him; and never cease to offer up gifts to God.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then the voice of Adam also became silent; and Jared and his children wondered at this. Then they laid the bodies as they were it first; and Jared and his children stood praying the whole of that night, until break of day. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then Jared made an offering and offered it up on the altar, as Adam had commanded him. And as he went up to the altar, he prayed to God for mercy and for forgiveness of his sin, concerning the lamp going out. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then God appeared unto Jared on the altar and blessed him and his children, and accepted their offerings; and commanded Jared to take of the sacred fire from the altar, and with it to light the lamp that shed light on the body of Adam. </p>
