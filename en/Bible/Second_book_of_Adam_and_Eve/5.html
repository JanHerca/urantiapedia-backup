<p> <i>The devil paints a brilliant picture for Seth to feast his thoughts upon.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AS for Seth, when he was seven years old, he knew good and evil, and was consistent in fasting and praying, and spent all his nights in entreating God for mercy and forgiveness. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He also fasted when bringing up his offering every day, more than his father did; for he was of a fair countenance, like unto an angel of God. He also had a good heart, preserved the finest qualities of his soul: and for this reason he brought up his offering every day. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And God was pleased with his offering; but He was also pleased with his purity. And he continued thus in doing the will of God, and of his father and mother, until he was seven years old. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  After that, as he was coming down from the altar, having ended his offering, Satan appeared unto him in the form of a beautiful angel, brilliant with light; with a staff of light in his hand, himself girt about with a girdle of light. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He greeted Seth with a beautiful smile, and began to beguile him with fair words, saying to him, “O Seth, why abidest thou in this mountain? For it is rough, full of stones and of sand, and of trees with no good fruit on them; a wilderness without habitations and without towns; no good place to dwell in. But all is heat, weariness, and trouble.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He said further, “But we dwell in beautiful places, in another world than this earth. Our world is one of light and our condition is of the best; our women are handsomer than any others; and I wish thee, O Seth, to wed one of them; because I see that thou art fair to look upon, and in this land there is not one woman good enough for thee. Besides, all those who live in this world, are only five souls. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “But in our world there are very many men and many maidens, all more beautiful one than another. I wish, therefore, to remove thee hence, that thou mayest see my relations and be wedded to which ever thou likest. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “Thou shalt then abide by me and be at peace; thou shalt be filled with splendour and light, as we are. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “Thou shalt remain in our world. and rest from this world and the misery of it; thou shalt never again feel faint and weary; thou shalt never bring up an offering, nor sue for mercy; for thou shalt commit no more sin, nor be swayed by passions. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “And if thou wilt hearken to what I say, thou shalt wed one of my daughters; for with us it is no sin so to do; neither is it reckoned animal lust. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “For in our world we have no God; but we all are gods; we all are of the light, heavenly, powerful, strong and glorious.” </p>
