<p> <i>The children of Jared are led astray.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN God revealed to him again the promise He had made to Adam; He explained to him the 5500 years, and revealed unto him the mystery of His coming upon the earth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God said to Jared, "As to that fire which thou hast taken from the altar to light the lamp withal, let it abide with you to give light to the bodies; and let it not come out of the cave, until the body of Adam comes out of it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But, O Jared, take care of the fire, that it burn bright in the lamp; neither go thou again out of the cave, until thou receivest an order through a vision, and not in an apparition, when seen by thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Then command again thy people not to hold intercourse with the children of Cain, and not to learn their ways; for I am God who loves not hatred and works of iniquity.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  God gave also many other commandments to Jared, and blessed him. And then withdrew His Word from him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Jared drew near with his children, took some fire, and came down to the cave, and lighted the lamp before the body of Adam; and he gave his people commandments as God had told him to do. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  This sign happened to Jared at the end of his four hundred and fiftieth year; as did also many other wonders, we do not record. But we record only this one for shortness sake, and in order not to lengthen our narrative. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Jared continued to teach his children eighty years; but after that they began to transgress the commandments he had given them, and to do many things without his counsel. They began to go down from the Holy Mountain one after another, and to mix with the children of Cain, in foul fellowships. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now the reason for which the children of Jared went down the Holy Mountain, is this, that we will now reveal unto you. </p>
