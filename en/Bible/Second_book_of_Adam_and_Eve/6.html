<p> <i>Seth's conscience helps him. He returns to Adam and Eve.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN Seth heard these words he was amazed, and inclined his heart to Satan's treacherous speech, and said to him, “Saidst thou there is another world created than this; and other creatures more beautiful than the creatures that are in this world?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Satan said, “Yes; behold thou hast heard me; but I will yet praise them and their ways, in thy hearing.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Seth said to him, "Thy speech has amazed me; and thy beautiful description of it all. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Yet I cannot go with thee to-day; not until I have gone to my father Adam and to my mother Eve, and told them all thou hast said to me. Then if they give me leave to go with thee, I will come.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Again Seth said, “I am afraid of doing any thing without my father's and mother's leave, lest I perish like my brother Cain, and like my father Adam, who transgressed the commandment of God. But, behold, thou knowest this place; come, and meet me here to-morrow.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When Satan heard this, he said to Seth, "If thou tellest thy father Adam what I have told thee, he will not let thee come with me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But hearken to me; do not tell thy father and mother what I have said to thee; but come with me to-day, to our world; where thou shalt see beautiful things and enjoy thyself there, and revel this day among my children, beholding them and taking thy fill of mirth; and rejoice ever more. Then I shall bring thee back to this place to-morrow; but if thou wouldest rather abide with me, so be it." </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Seth answered, "The spirit of my father and of my mother, hangs on me; and if I hide from them one day, they will die, and God will hold me guilty of sinning against them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “And except that they know I am come to this place to bring up to it my offering, they would not be separated from me one hour; neither should I go to any other place, unless they let me. But they treat me most kindly, because I come back to them quickly.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Satan said to him, “What will happen to thee if thou hide thyself from them one night, and return to them at break of day?” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But Seth, when he saw how he kept on talking, and that he would not leave him-ran, and went up to the altar, and spread his hands unto God, and sought deliverance from Him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then God sent His Word, and cursed Satan, who fled from Him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But as for Seth, he had gone up to the altar, saying thus in his heart. “The altar is the place of offering, and God is there; a divine fire shall consume it; so shall Satan be unable to hurt me, and shall not take me away thence.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then Seth came down from the altar and went to his father and mother, where he found in the way, longing to hear his voice; for he had tarried a while. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He then began to tell them what had befallen him from Satan, under the form of an angel. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But when Adam heard his account, he kissed his face, and warned him against that angel, telling him it was Satan who thus appeared to him. Then Adam took Seth, and they went to the Cave of Treasures, and rejoiced therein. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But from that day forth Adam and Eve never parted from him, to whatever place he might go, whether for his offering or for any thing else. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  This sign happened to Seth, when he was nine years old. </p>
