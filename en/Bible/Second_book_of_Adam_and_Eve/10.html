<p> <i>“Adam was the first....”</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND when they had ended their prayer, the Word of God came and comforted them concerning their father Adam. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  After this, they offered their gifts for themselves and for their father. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And when they had ended their offering, the Word of God came to Seth, the eldest among them, saying unto him, "O Seth, Seth, Seth, three times. As I was with thy father, so also shall I be with thee, until the fulfilment of the promise I made him-thy father saying, I will send My Word and save thee and thy seed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But as to thy father Adam, keep thou the commandment he gave thee; and sever thy seed from that of Cain thy brother." </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And God withdrew His Word from Seth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Seth, Eve, and their children, came down from the mountain to the Cave of Treasures. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Adam was the first whose soul died in the land of Eden, in the Cave of Treasures; for no one died before him, but his son Abel, who died murdered. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then all the children of Adam rose up, and wept over their father Adam, and made offerings to him, one hundred and forty days. </p>
