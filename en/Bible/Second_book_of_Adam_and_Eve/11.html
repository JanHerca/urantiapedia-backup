<p> <i>Seth becomes head of the most happy and just tribe of people who ever lived.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AFTER the death of Adam and of Eve, Seth severed his children, and his children's children, from Cain's children. Cain and his seed went down and dwelt westward, below the place where he had killed his brother Abel. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But Seth and his children, dwelt northwards upon the mountain of the Cave of Treasures, in order to be near to their father Adam. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Seth the elder, tall and good, with a fine soul, and of a strong mind, stood at the head of his people; and tended them in innocence, penitence, and meekness, and did not allow one of them to go down to Cain's children. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But because of their own purity, they were named “Children of God,” and they were with God, instead of the hosts of angels who fell; for they continued in praises to God, and in singing psalms unto Him, in their cave—the Cave of Treasures. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Seth stood before the body of his father Adam, and of his mother Eve, and prayed night and day, and asked for mercy towards himself and his children; and that when he had some difficult dealing with a child, He would give him counsel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But Seth and his children did not like earthly work, but gave themselves to heavenly things; for they had no other thought than praises, doxologies, and psalms unto God. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore did they at all times hear the voices of angels, praising and glorifying God; from within the garden, or when they were sent by God on an errand, or when they were going up to heaven. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For Seth and his children, by reason of their own purity, heard and saw those angels. Then, again, the garden was not far above them, but only some fifteen spiritual cubits. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now one spiritual cubit answers to three cubits of man, altogether forty-five cubits. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Seth and his children dwelt on the mountain below the garden; they sowed not, neither did they reap; they wrought no food for the body not even wheat; but only offerings. They ate of the fruit and of trees well flavoured that grew on the mountain where they dwelt. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then Seth often fasted every forty days, as did also his eldest children. For the family of Seth smelled the smell of the trees in the garden, when the wind blew that way. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They were happy, innocent, without sudden fear, there was no jealousy, no evil action, no hatred among them. There was no animal passion; from no mouth among them went forth either foul words or curse; neither evil counsel nor fraud. For the men of that time never swore, but under hard circumstances, when men must swear, they swore by the blood of Abel the just. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But they constrained their children and their women every day in the cave to fast and pray, and to worship the most High God. They blessed themselves n the body of their father Adam, and anointed themselves with it. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And they did so until the end of Seth drew near. </p>
