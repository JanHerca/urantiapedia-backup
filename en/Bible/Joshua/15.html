<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim); </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the west border was to the great sea, and the border [thereof]. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak (the same is Hebron). </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when she came [unto him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. </p>
