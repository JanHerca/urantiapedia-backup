<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give [thee] the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah. </p>
