<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. </p>
