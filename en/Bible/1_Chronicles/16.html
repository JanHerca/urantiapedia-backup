<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  [Saying], Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein; </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required; </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon, </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel; </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever; </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  and with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and [with] instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. </p>
