<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah [dwelleth] under curtains. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  What can David [say] yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt? <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found [in his heart] to pray before thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever. </p>
