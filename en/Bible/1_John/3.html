<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and [such] we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And every one that hath this hope [set] on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [My] little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But whoso hath the world's goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  [My] Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. </p>
