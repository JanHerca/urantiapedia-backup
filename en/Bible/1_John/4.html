<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the [spirit] of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye are of God, [my] little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They are of the world: therefore speak they [as] of the world, and the world heareth them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  We love, because he first loved us. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also. </p>
