<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  which is not another [gospel] only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  and they glorified God in me. </p>
