## XXVI. About the numerous healings that Jesus performed in the town, in the village and in different places

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span> One day, Jesus, who had left his house, was traveling alone through the country of the Galileans. And, having arrived at a village, which was called Buboron or Buasboroín, he found there a man of thirty years old, who was very uncomfortable because of the vehemence of his illness, and who was lying on his bed. When Jesus saw him, he had compassion on him and asked him, “What race are you?” The man replied: Of Syrian race and from the country of the Syrians. Jesus added: Do you still have a father and mother? The man said: Yes, and my parents have expelled me from their home. I wander everywhere to seek my daily sustenance, but I do not have a home anywhere. Jesus asked: And how were you able to leave your country? The man responded: They dealt with me, sometimes against salary, and other times to pay me. Jesus continued: Why have you come to this country? The man answered: To ask for alms, and to meet my material needs. And Jesus stated gravely: If you endure your torments calmly, you will find rest later. To which the man replied: Whether I can or cannot, I endure them and accept them with joy.

<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> And Jesus said, What god do you serve? The man replied: To the god Pathea. And Jesus asked him: Do you then find it right that you should be in this state? The man said: I have heard my parents say that this god is the god of the Syrians, and that he can do to men whatever he pleases. Jesus asked: What is your name? The man said: Hiram. And Jesus warned him, saying: If you want to be cured, abandon that error. Hiram said: And how am I to believe your proposal? Because you are still a child, while I am already an adult man. And Jesus asked him: Does the god of your worship have the power to restore your health and life with a simple word? And Jesus added: If you believe with all your heart, and if you confess that there is a God of heaven and earth, who created the world and man, such a God is able to heal you. Hiram noted: I haven't heard of him. Jesus said: Let it be. But he simply believes, and your soul will live. Hiram asked him: And how to make that leap of faith?

<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> Jesus answered: Here is the formula. I believe that he is a very high God, the Father creator of all things, and I believe in his only Son and in the Holy Spirit, one and perfect trinity and divinity. Hiram replied: I believe what you tell me. Then Jesus spoke to him, questioning him: Have you not presented yourself to someone to heal you? And Hiram exclaimed: What doctor could free me from such a serious illness? Jesus said: Whoever you pay, he will be able to do it easily. Hiram objected: Poor as I am, I have nothing to give, and no one does charity for free. And Jesus objected: Have you not yourself said before that you have come from a far country, that you have traveled through many regions, and that you have received alms? Why do you now falsely say that you have nothing to pay? Hiram replied: Forgive me, child! What I have told you is that I have nothing to give, except the food I receive each day, and the clothing that covers me.

<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> And Jesus, seeing him crying, exclaimed: O man, address your request to me! What can I do for you? And Hiram answered: Do for me whatever you please, and reward me with some help. And Jesus stretched out his hand and took his, and commanded him, Arise, stand on your feet, and go in peace. And, at the same moment, the man was cured of his illness. And he fell on his knees crying before Jesus, and made the following request: Lord, if you wish, I will follow you as a disciple. But Jesus said to him: Return to your house in peace, and tell everything I have done for you in this meeting. And the man prostrated himself again before Jesus, and went to his country.
