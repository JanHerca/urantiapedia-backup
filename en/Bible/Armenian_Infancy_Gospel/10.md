## X. Of the shepherds who saw the nativity of the Lord

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span> And near that place lived the shepherds of whom we have already spoken. But their flocks of goats and sheep were gathered only at nightfall, in remote and distant places, where they grazed in the mountains and on the plain. And when it was dark, each shepherd gathered his flock, and kept vigil and kept the night watches over it. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon the shepherds, and the brightness of God surrounded them with brilliance. And they were greatly afraid, and shouting, they gathered together in one place, and said one to another: What word is this that has come down to us, and that we do not know?

<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> But the angel said to them again: Do not be afraid, you discreet and intelligent men who have gathered together. For behold, I give you news of great joy, and that is that this very day a savior has been born to you, who is the Christ of the Lord, in the city of David. And this will be a sign to you. When you enter the grotto, you will find a child wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in an oxen's manger. And after having heard the angel, the shepherds, fifteen in number, hurried to the place indicated to them. And when they saw Jesus, they fell down before him and worshiped him. And they praised God with a loud voice, saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will toward men. And each of the shepherds returned to his flock, praising and glorifying Christ.
