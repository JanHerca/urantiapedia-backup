## XXIII. How the Holy Family went to the country of Galilee and what Jesus did with the children of the Hebrews. A miracle

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span> And Joseph rose at dawn, took the child and his mother, and left the town, They walked in silence. And Mary asked Jesus: My son, why have you hidden yourself like this from those people? Jesus answered: My mother, be silent, and continue your path in peace. I will always do what is convenient. And they stayed there six months. And Jesus circulated through the territory of the town. And he was going to sit near the children, in the place where the children gathered, with whom he had long conversations. But they could not understand what he was telling them.

<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> Then, Jesus led the children to the edge of a well, where the entire village went to get water. And, taking their jugs from the children's hands, he knocked them together, or broke them against the stone, and threw them into the well. And the children did not dare to return home, for fear of punishment from their parents. And Jesus, seeing them crying, called them to him and said to them: Do not cry, because he will give you back your jugs. And, leaning over the well, he gave orders to the water, and it brought the pitchers intact to its surface. And each of the children collected theirs, and they returned to their homes, and told everyone about the miracles of Jesus.

<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> One day, Jesus took the children with him, and stopped them near a large tree. And Jesus commanded the tree to take down its branches, which he climbed up and sat on. And he commanded the tree to rise, and the tree rose, dominating all that place, and Jesus remained in it for an hour. And, as the children shouted to him, telling him to order the tree to come down, so that they could also climb up, Jesus ordered the tree to bend its branches, and said to his companions: Come to me. And the children went up joyfully and stood around Jesus. And he, after having waited a little, ordered the tree to come down again. And the children descended with Jesus, and the tree regained its position.

<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> And it came to pass another day that the children were gathered together in a certain place, and Jesus was with them. And there was a twelve-year-old boy there, attacked, in his entire person, by very painful ailments. Leper, epileptic, mutilated at the extremities of his hands and feet, he had lost his human form, could not walk, and lay on the side of the road. When Jesus saw him, he had pity on him and said to him, “Child, show yourself to me.” And the boy, taking off his clothes, was left naked. And Jesus ordered the children to spread it on the ground, kneaded dust from the ground, spread it on the patient, and said: Stretch out your hand, for you are cured of all your diseases. And, at the same instant, all of his damaged skin was separated from his body, his tendons and the joints of his bones were firmed, and his flesh became like the flesh of a newborn, and It was clean. And he arose, weeping, and rushed to the feet of Lesus, and prostrated himself before him. And Jesus said to him: Go in peace. And he marched joyfully towards his dwelling, and all those who were with him, witnesses of the miracle that Jesus had performed, wanted to see him, but they did not find him.
