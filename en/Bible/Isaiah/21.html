<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it. </p>
