<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel, who I have chosen: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant; and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  One shall say, I am Jehovah's; and another shall call [himself] by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and showed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know: that they may be put to shame. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be put to shame together. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The smith [maketh] an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and shapeth it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the holm-tree and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest: he planteth a fir-tree, and the rain doth nourish it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am Jehovah, that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth (who is with me?); </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  that frustrateth the signs of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  That saith of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and of the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid. </p>
