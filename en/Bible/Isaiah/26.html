<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]; because he trusteth in thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, [even] Jehovah, is an everlasting rock. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial [name], is the desire of our soul. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see [thy] zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Jehovah, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening was upon them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. </p>
