<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh [unto me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught [them]; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction. </p>
