<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He will not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set justice in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yea, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace [with me], and blind as Jehovah's servant? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not Jehovah? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. </p>
