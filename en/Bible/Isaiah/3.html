<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  in that day shall he lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Say ye of the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  the rings, and the nose-jewels; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground. </p>
