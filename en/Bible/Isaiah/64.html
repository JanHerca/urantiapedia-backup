<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  as when fire kindleth the brushwood, [and] the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore? </p>
