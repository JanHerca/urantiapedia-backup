<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary [beast]. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth, that have been carried from the womb; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry [you]; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To whom will ye like me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. </p>
