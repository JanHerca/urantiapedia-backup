<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who [among them] considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke [was due]? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </p>
