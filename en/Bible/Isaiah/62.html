<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah's remembrancers, take ye no rest, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken. </p>
