<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing ye unto it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I Jehovah am its keeper; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wrath is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them, I would burn them together. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; [yea], let him make peace with me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In measure, when thou sendest them away, thou dost content with them; he hath removed [them] with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, [so that] the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no favor. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will beat off [his fruit] from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem. </p>
