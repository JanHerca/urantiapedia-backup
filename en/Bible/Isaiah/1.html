<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged [and gone] backward. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. </p>
