<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  (for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of hosts is his name): </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should [my name] be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the wicked. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
