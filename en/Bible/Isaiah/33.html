<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: [the enemy] hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves]. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given [him]; his waters shall be sure. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed [the tribute]? where is he that counted the towers? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. </p>
