<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, [saying], Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thus hath Jehovah said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away [and] cut down. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In that time shall a present be brought unto Jehovah of hosts [from] a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion. </p>
