<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he came, and he taketh [it] out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood [men] of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and madest them [to be] unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things are in them, heard I saying, Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, [be] the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped. </p>
