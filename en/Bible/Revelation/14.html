<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard [was] as [the voice] of harpers harping with their harps: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, [even] they that had been purchased out of the earth. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These [are] they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, [to be] the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud [I saw] one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great [winepress], of the wrath of God. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs. </p>
