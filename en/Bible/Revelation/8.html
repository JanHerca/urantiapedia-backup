<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, [even] they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound. </p>
