<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And their dead bodies [lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do [men] look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become [the kingdom] of out Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and [the time] to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
