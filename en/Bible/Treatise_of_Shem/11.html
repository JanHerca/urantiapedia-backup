<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And there will be spring rains. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And fishing in the sea will be [prosper]ous. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when (the sea) billows ships will be wrecked. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And (people): will become sick. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And wine and oil and wheat, each of them, shall be pleasing. </p>

<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And there will be a great disease among men. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And there will come forth a black man who seeks the kingdom. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the house of the kingdom will perish. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the king will seek to understand what men are saying, and (will) lay waste many cities. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And no one will be able to stop him; and the fear of God and his mercies (will) be absent from him. </p>
