<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The second wrote, The king is strongest. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. </p>
