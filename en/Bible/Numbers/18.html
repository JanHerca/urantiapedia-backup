<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs). </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah's heave-offering to Aaron the priest. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not. </p>
