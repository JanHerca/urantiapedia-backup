<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
