<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah's passover. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your [feast of] weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  one he-goat, to make atonement for you. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink-offerings. </p>
