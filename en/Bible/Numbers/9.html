<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they kept the passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or [if it continued] by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses. </p>
