<p> <i>Soul and body</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And God said to him, “Hear, Ezra. my beloved one. I, being immortal, received </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  a cross, I tasted vinegar and gall, I was set down in a grave. And I raised up my elect ones and I summoned up Adam from Hades so that the race of men </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [...]. Therefore, fear not death. For that which is from mes that is the soul, departs for heaven. That which is from the earth, that is the body, departs for the </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  earth from which it was taken.” And the prophet said, “Woe, woe! What shall I do? How shall I act? I know not.” </p>
<p> <i>Concluding prayerb</i> </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And then the blessed Ezra began to say, “O eternal God, Creator of the whole creation, who measured out the heaven with a span and contained the earth in his </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  hand, who drives the cherubim, who took the prophet Elijah to the heavens in </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  a fiery chariot, who gives nurture to all flesh, whom all things fear and tremble </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  from the face of your power, hear me who pleads greatly and give to all who </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  copy this book and preserve it and recall my name and preserve my memory fully, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  give them blessing from heaven. And bless all of his things, just as the ends of </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Joseph.d And remember not his previous sins on the day of his judgment. Those </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  who do not believe this book will be burned like Sodom and Gomorrah.” And a voice carne to him saying, “Ezra. my beloved, I shall grant to each one the things which you asked.” </p>
<p> <i>Death and burial of Ezra</i> </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And at once he gave over his precious soul with much honor on the eighteenth </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  of the month of October. And they buried him with incense and psalms. His precious and holy body provides unceasingly strengthening of souls and bodies for those who approach him willingly. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Glory, might, honor, and worship to him for whom it is fitting, for the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
