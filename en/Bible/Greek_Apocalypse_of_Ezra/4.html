<p> <i>Ezra descends to Tartarus</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, I shall never cease arguing the case with you.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God said, “Count the flowers of the earth. If you can count them you also will be able to argue the case with me.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, I cannot count them—I bear human flesh—but </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  neither will I stop arguing the case with you. I wish, Lord, to see the lower parts </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  of Tartarus.” And God said, “Go down and see!” And he gave me Michael </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and Gabriel and thirty-four other angels, and I descended eighty-five steps and they led me down five hundred steps. </p>
<p> <i>The punishment of Herod</i> </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I saw a fiery throne and an old man seated on it, and his punishment was </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  merciless. And I said to the angels, “Who is this and what is his sin?” And they said to me, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “This is Herod, who was king for a time, and he commanded to kill </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  the infants two years old or under.” And I said, “Woe upon his soul!” The disobedient and the abyss </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And again they led me down thirty steps. And I saw boiling fires there, and a </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  multitude of sinners in them. And I heard their voices, but I did not perceive their </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  forms. And they led me down deeper many steps which I was unable to count. </p>
<p id="v16,"><sup><small>16,</small></sup>  And I saw old men there, and fiery axles were revolving upon their ears.d And </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I said, “Who are these and what is their sin?” And they said to me, “These are </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  the eavesdroppers.” And again they led me down five hundred Other steps. And </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  there I saw the unsleeping worm and fire consuming the sinners. And they led me down to the foundation of Apoleia (Destruction) and there I saw the twelvefold </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  blow of the abyss. And they led me away to the south and there I saw a man </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  hanging from his eyelids and the angels were beating him. And I asked, “Who </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  is this and what is his sin?” And Michael the archistrategos said to me, “This man is incestuous; having carried out a small lust, this man was commanded to be hanged.” </p>
<p> <i>The Antichrist</i> </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And they led me away to the north and I saw a man there restrained with iron </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  bars. And I asked, “Who is this?” And he said to me, “This is the one who says, ‘I am the son of God and he who made stones bread and water wine.’” </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Make known to me what sort of appearance he has and </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  I will inform the race of men lest they believe in him.” And he said to me, “The appearance of his face is as of a wild man. His right eye is like a star rising at </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  dawn and the other is unmoving. His mouth is one cubit, his teeth are a span </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  long, his fingers like scythes, the soles of his feet two span, and on his forehead </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  an inscription ‘Antichrist.’ He was exalted up to heaven, he will descend as far </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  as Hades. One time he will be a child, another an old man.” And the prophet </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  said, “Lord, how do you permit the race of men to stray?” And God said, “Hear, my prophet! He becomes a Child and an old man and let no one believe him that </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  he is my beloved son. And after these things a trumpet, and the graves will be </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  opened and the dead will rise up uncorrupted. Then the opponent, having heard </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  the terrible threat, will hide himself in the outer darkness. Then the heaven and </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  the earth and the sea will perish. Then I shall bum the heaven for eighty cubits </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  and the earth for eight hundred cubits.” And the prophet said, “And (in) what </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  did the heaven sin?” And God said, “Since [...] is the evil.” And the prophet </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  said, “Lord, (in) what did the earth sin?” And God said, “Since the opponent having heard my terrible threat will hide (in it), and because of that I shall melt the earth and with it the rebel of the race of men.” </p>
