<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, you know that I bear human flesh. And how can </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I count the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea?” And God said, “O my elect prophet, no man will know that great day and the manifestation which prevails to </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  judge the world. For your sake, O my prophet, I told you the day, but the hour </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I told you not.” And the prophet said, “Lord, tell me also the years.” And God said, “If I see that the justice of the world has become abundant, I will be long-suffering toward them. If not, I will stretch out my hand and I will grasp the inhabited world from its four corners and I will gather them all together to the valley of Jehosaphat and I will wipe out the human race and the world will be no </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  more.” And the prophet said, “And how will your right hand be glorified?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And God said, “I will be glorified by my angels.” </p>
<p> <i>Why was man created?</i> </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, if this was your calculation, Why did you form </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  man? You said to Abraham our father, ‘I will surely multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand along the shore of the sea.’ And where is your promise?” </p>
<p> <i>Signs of the end</i> </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And God said, “First I shall cause by shakingd the fall of four-footed beasts and </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  men. And when you see that brother delivers brother over to death and children </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  will rise up against parents and a wife abandons her own husband, and when nation will rise up against nation in war, then you shall know that the end is near. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And then brother will not have mercy upon brother, nor man upon his wife, nor </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  children upon parents, nor friends upon friends, nor slave upon master. For the opponent of men himself will come up from Tartarus and will show many things </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  to men. What shall I do to you, Ezra, and will you argue the case with me?” </p>
