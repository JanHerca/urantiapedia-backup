<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Pity, O Lord, the race of Christians.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw a woman suspended and four wild beasts were sucking upon her breasts. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the angels said to me, “She begrudged giving her milk but also cast infants into the rivers.” </p>

<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There is there neither young nor old, neither brother with brother nor mother with Child nor wife with husband. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I wept and said, “O Lord, Lord, have mercy upon the sinners.” </p>

<p> <i>Birth and its purpose</i> </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And God said, “Hear Ezra, beloved one! Just as a farmer casts down the seed of corn into the earth, so a man casts down his seed into a woman's place. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In the first (month) it is a whole, in the second it is swollen, in the third it grows hair, in the fourth it grows nails, in the fifth it becomes milky, in the sixth it is ready and quickened, in the seventh it is prepared, [in the eighth...], in the ninth the bars of the gateways of the woman are opened and it is born healthy on the earth.” </p>

<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And God said in his exalted pronouncement, “I will not pardon those who transgress my covenant.” </p>
