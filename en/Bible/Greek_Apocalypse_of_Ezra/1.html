<p> <i>Introduction and prayer</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  It came to pass in the thirtieth year on the twenty-second of the month, I was in my house and I cried out, saying to the Most High, “Lord, grant (me) glory so </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  that I may see your mysteries.” When night fell the angel Michael, the archangel, came and said to me, “Prophet Ezra, lay aside bread for seventy weeks.” And </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I fasted just as he told me. And the archistrategos Raphael came and gave me a storax staff, and I fasted twice sixty weeks, and I saw the mysteries of God </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and his angels. And I said to them, “I wish to plead with God concerning the Christian people. It were better that man were not born than that he entered the world.” </p>
<p> <i>Ezra taken up to heaven: his prayer for mercy</i> </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore, I was taken up into heaven and I saw in the first heaven a great </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  command of angels and they led me to the judgments. And I heard a voice saying </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  to me, “Have pity upon us, Ezra elect of God.” Then I began to say, “Woe to the sinners when they see the righteous man (elevated) above angels, and they are </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  for fiery Gehenna.” And Ezra said, “Have pity upon the works of your hands, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  merciful and greatly pitying one. Condemn me rather than the souls of the sinners, for it is better to punish one soul and not to bring the whole world to </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  destruction.” And God said, “I shall give rest to the righteous in Paradise and </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  1 am merciful.” And Ezra said, “Lord, Why do you show favor to the righteous? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For as a hired man completes his time of service and goes away, and again a slave serves his masters in order to receive his wage, thus the righteous man receives his reward in the heavens. But, have mercy upon the sinners for we know that </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  you are merciful.” And God said, “I have no way to be merciful to them.” And </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Ezra said, “(Be merciful) because they cannot sustain your anger.” And God said, “(I am wrathful) because such (are the deserts) of such (men) as these.” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And God said, “I wish to keep you as both Paul and John. You have given me uncorrupted the inviolate treasury, the treasure of virginity, the wall of men.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p> <i>Ezra's second prayer</i> </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Ezra said, “It were better if man were not born; it were well if he were </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  not alive. The dumb beasts are a better thing than man, for they do not have </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  punishment. You took us and delivered us to judgment. Woe to the sinners in the world to come, for their condemnation is endless and the flame unquenched.” </p>
