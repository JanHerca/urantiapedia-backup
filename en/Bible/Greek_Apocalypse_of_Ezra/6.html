<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then God said to me, “Ezra, do you know the names of the angels who are over the consummation: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon?” </p>
<p> <i>Ezra struggles for his soul</i> </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then a voice came to me, “Come here, die, Ezra, my beloved! Give back that which has been entrusted (to you).” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “And whence can you bring forth my soul?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can cast it forth through your mouth.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “I spoke mouth to mouth with God and it will not go forth from there.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the angels said. “We will bring it forth through your nostrils.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “My nostrils smelled the glory of God.”" </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your eyes.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “My eyes have seen the back of God.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your head.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your feet.” And the prophet said, “I walked with Moses on the mountain, and it will not come forth from there.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can cast it forth through the tips of your (toe)nails.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “My feet walked in in the sanctuary.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the angels departed unsuccessful, saying, “Lord, we cannot receive his soul.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then he said to his only begotten son, “Go down, my beloved son, with a numerous host of angels, taking the soul of my beloved Ezra.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the Lord, having taken a numerous army of many angels, said to the prophet, “Give me that deposit which I entrusted to you. The crown is readied for you.” </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, if you take my soul from me, who will you have left to plead on behalf of the race of men?” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And God said, “You who are mortal and earthly, do not plead the case with me.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “I shall never cease pleading.” </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And God said, “Give, in the meanwhile, that which is entrusted (to you). The crown is readied for you. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Come here, die, so that you may attain it.” </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then the prophet began to speak with tears, “O Lord, what profits it that I plead the case with you, and I am going to fall to the earth? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Woe, woe! for I will be consumed by worms. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Bewail me, all holy and pious ones, I plead greatly and </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  am delivered over to death! Bewail me, all holy and just ones, because I have entered the bowl of Hades.” </p>
