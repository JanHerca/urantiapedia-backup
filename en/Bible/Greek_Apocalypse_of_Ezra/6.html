<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then God said to me, “Ezra, do you know the names of the angels who are </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  over the consummation: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon?” </p>
<p> <i>Ezra struggles for his soul</i> </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then a voice came to me, “Come here, die, Ezra, my beloved! Give back that </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  which has been entrusted (to you).” And the prophet said, “And whence can </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  you bring forth my soul?” And the angels said, “We can cast it forth through </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  your mouth.” And the prophet said, “I spoke mouth to mouth with God and it </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  will not go forth from there.” And the angels said. “We will bring it forth through </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  your nostrils.” And the prophet said, “My nostrils smelled the glory of God.”" </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your eyes.” And the prophet </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  said, “My eyes have seen the back of God.” And the angels said, “We can bring </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  it forth through your head.” And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your feet.” And the prophet said, “I walked with Moses on the mountain, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and it will not come forth from there.” And the angels said, “We can cast it </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  forth through the tips of your (toe)nails.” And the prophet said, “My feet walked in in the sanctuary.” And the angels departed unsuccessful, saying, “Lord, we </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  cannot receive his soul.” Then he said to his only begotten son, “Go down, my beloved son, with a numerous host of angels, taking the soul of my beloved Ezra.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the Lord, having taken a numerous army of many angels, said to the prophet, “Give me that deposit which I entrusted to you. The crown is readied for you.” </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the prophet said, “Lord, if you take my soul from me, who will you have </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  left to plead on behalf of the race of men?” And God said, “You who are mortal </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and earthly, do not plead the case with me.” And the prophet said, “I shall never </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  cease pleading.” And God said, “Give, in the meanwhile, that which is entrusted </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  (to you). The crown is readied for you. Come here, die, so that you may attain </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  it.” Then the prophet began to speak with tears, “O Lord, what profits it that I </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  plead the case with you, and I am going to fall to the earth? Woe, woe! for I will </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  be consumed by worms. Bewail me, all holy and pious ones, I plead greatly and </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  am delivered over to death! Bewail me, all holy and just ones, because I have entered the bowl of Hades.” </p>
