<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress [spears] are brandished. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, [they cry]; but none looketh back. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion [and] the lioness walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
