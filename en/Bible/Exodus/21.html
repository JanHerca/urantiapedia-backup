<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If he take him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And if he smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead [beast] shall be his. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] shall be his own. </p>
