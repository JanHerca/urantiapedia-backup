<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And thou shalt make its pots to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its flesh-hooks, and its firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass: and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And thou shalt put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with brass. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in bearing it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hollow with planks shalt thou make it: as it hath been showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [shall be] of silver. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The hangings for the one side [of the gate] shall be fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And for the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And for the gate of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  All the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of brass. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  All the instruments of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah: it shall be a statue for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel. </p>
