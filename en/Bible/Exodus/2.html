<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them]. </p>
