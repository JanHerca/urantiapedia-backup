<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest [justice]: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release [it] with him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to thy poor in his cause. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in it mother's milk. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. </p>
