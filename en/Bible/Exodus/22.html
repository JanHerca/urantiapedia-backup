<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, [to see] whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he shall not make good that which was torn. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  If thou at all take thy neighbor's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. </p>
