<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites according to their families. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? </p>
