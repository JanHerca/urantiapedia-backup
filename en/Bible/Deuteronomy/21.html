<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood [to remain] in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. </p>
