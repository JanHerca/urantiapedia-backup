<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's [wife]. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to the sojourner, [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's raiment to pledge; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  When thou gatherest [the grapes of] thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. </p>
