<p> <i>Note the sudden transition from the person of the Psalmist to the person of the Lord (v. 10). This is like the canonical Psalter in style.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Open ye, open ye your hearts to the exultation of the Lord: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And let your love be multiplied from the heart and even to the lips, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To bring forth fruit to the Lord [fruit], holy [fruit], and to talk with watchfulness in His light. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Rise up, and stand erect, ye who sometime were brought low: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Tell forth ye who were in silence, that your mouth hath been opened. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye, therefore, that were despised, be henceforth lifted up, because your righteousness hath been exalted. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the right hand of the Lord is with you: and He is your helper: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And peace was prepared for you, before ever your war was. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hear the word of truth, and receive the knowledge of the Most High. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Your flesh has not known what I am saying to you neither have your hearts known what I am showing to you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Keep my secret, ye who are kept by it: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Keep my faith, ye who are kept by it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And understand my knowledge, ye who know me in truth. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Love me with affection, ye who love: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For I do not turn away my face from them that are mine; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For I know them, and before they came into being I took knowledge of them, and on their faces I set my seal: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I fashioned their members: my own breasts I prepared for them, that they might drink my holy milk and live thereby. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  took pleasure in them and am not ashamed of them: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For my workmanship are they and the strength of my thoughts: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Who then shall rise up against my handiwork, or who is there that is not subject to them? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I willed and fashioned mind and heart: and they are mine, and by my own right hand I set my elect ones: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And my righteousness goeth before them and they shall not be deprived of my name, for it is with them. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Ask, and abound and abide in the love of the Lord, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And yet beloved ones in the Beloved: those who are kept, in Him that liveth: </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And they that are saved in Him that was saved; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And ye shall be found incorrupt in all ages to the name of your Father. Hallelujah. </p>
