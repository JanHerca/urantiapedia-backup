<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I was rescued from my bonds and unto thee, my God, I fled: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thou art the right hand of my Salvation and my helper. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou hast restrained those that rise up against me, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I shall see him no more: because thy face was with me, which saved me by thy grace. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But I was despised and rejected in the eye of many: and I was in their eyes like lead, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And strength was mine from thyself and help. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou didst set me a lamp at my right hand and at my left: and in me there shall be nothing that is not bright: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I was clothed with the covering of thy Spirit, and thou didst remove from me my raiment of skin; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For thy right hand lifted me up and removed sickness from me: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I became mighty in: the truth, and holy by thy righteousness; and all my adversaries were afraid of me; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I became admirable by the name of the Lord, and was justified by His gentleness, and His rest is for ever and ever. Hallelujah. </p>
