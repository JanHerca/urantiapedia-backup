<p> <i>“No cradled child more softly lies than I: come soon, eternity.”</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The dew of the Lord in quietness He distilled upon me: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the cloud of peace He caused to rise over my head, which guarded me continually; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  It was to me for salvation: everything was shaken and they were affrighted; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And there came forth from them a smoke and a judgment; and I was keeping quiet in the order of the Lord: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  More than shelter was He to me, and more than foundation. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I was carried like a child by his mother: and He gave me milk, the dew of the Lord: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I grew great by His bounty, and rested in His perfection, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I spread out my hands in the lifting up of my soul: and I was made right with the Most High, and I was redeemed with Him. Hallelujah. </p>
