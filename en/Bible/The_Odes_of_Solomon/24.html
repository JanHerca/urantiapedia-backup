<p> <i>The mention of the Dove refers to a lost Gospel to which there are rare references in ancient writings.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Dove fluttered over the Messiah, because He was her head; and she sang over Him and her voice was heard: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the inhabitants were afraid and the sojourners were moved: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The birds dropped their wings and all creeping things died in their holes: and the abysses were opened which had been hidden; and they cried to the Lord like women in travail: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And no food was given to them, because it did not belong to them; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they sealed up the abysses with the seal of the Lord. And they perished, in the thought, those that had existed from ancient times; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For they were corrupt from the beginning; and the end of their corruption was life: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And every one of them that was imperfect perished: for it was not possible to give them a word that they might remain: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the Lord destroyed the imaginations of all them that had not the truth with them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For they who in their hearts were lifted up were deficient in wisdom, and so they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the Lord disclosed His way, and spread abroad His grace: and those who understood it, know His holiness. Hallelujah. </p>
