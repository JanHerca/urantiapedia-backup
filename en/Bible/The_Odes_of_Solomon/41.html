<p> <i>We discover that the writer may be a Gentile (v. 8).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  All the Lord's children will praise Him, and will collect the truth of His faith. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And His children shall be known to Him. Therefore we will sing in His love: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We live in the Lord by His grace: and life we receive in His Messiah: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For a great day has shined upon us: and marvellous is He who has given us of His glory. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let us, therefore, all of us unite together in the name of the Lord, and let us honour Him in His goodness, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And let our faces shine in His light: and let our hearts meditate in His love by night and by day. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let us exult with the joy of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  All those will be astonished that see me. For from another race am I: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the Father of truth remembered me: He who possessed me from the beginning: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For His bounty begat me, and the thought of His heart: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And His Word is with us in all our way; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The Saviour who makes alive and does not reject our souls-; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The man who was humbled, and exalted by His own righteousness, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The Son of the Most High appeared in the perfection of His Father; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And light dawned from the Word that was beforetime in Him; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The Messiah is truly one; and He was known before the foundation of the world, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  That He might save souls for ever by the truth of His name: a new song arises from those who love Him. Hallelujah. </p>
