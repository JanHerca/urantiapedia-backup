<p> <i>A song that Marcus Aurelius might have known when he said “Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break.”</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The abysses were dissolved before the Lord: and darkness was destroyed by His appearance: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Error went astray and perished at His hand: and folly found no path to walk in, and was submerged by the truth of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He opened His mouth and spake grace and joy: and He spake a new song of praise to His name: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And He lifted up His voice to the Most High, and offered to Him the sons that were with Him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And His face was justified, for thus His holy Father had given to Him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Come forth, ye that have been afflicted and receive joy, and possess your souls by His grace; and take to you immortal life. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And they made me a debtor when I rose up, me who had been a debtor: and they divided my spoil, though nothing was due to them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But I endured and held my peace and was silent, as if not, moved by them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But I stood unshaken like a firm rock which is beaten by the waves and endures. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I bore their bitterness for humility's sake: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In order, that I might redeem my people, and inherit it and that I might not make void my promises to the fathers, to whom I promised the salvation of their seed. Hallelujah. </p>
