<p> <i>Theologians have never agreed on an explanation of this perplexing Ode.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I rested in the Spirit of the Lord: and the Spirit raised me on high: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And made me stand on my feet in the height of the Lord, before His perfection and His glory, while I was praising Him by the composition of His songs. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Spirit brought me forth before the face of the Lord: and, although a son of man, I was named the Illuminate, the Son of God: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  While I praised amongst the praising ones, and great was I amongst the mighty ones. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For according to the greatness of the Most High, so He made me: and like His own newness He renewed me; and He anointed me from His own perfection: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I became one of His Neighbours; and my mouth was opened, like a cloud of dew, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And my heart poured out as it were a gushing stream of righteousness, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And my access to Him was in peace; and I was established by the Spirit of His government. Hallelujah. </p>
