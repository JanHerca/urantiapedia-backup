<p> <i>A beautiful sketch of Paradise regained and the blessedness of those who have returned to the privileges of the fallen Adam.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My heart was cloven and its flower appeared; and grace sprang up in it: and it brought forth fruit to the Lord, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the Most High clave my heart by His Holy Spirit and searched my affection towards Him: and filled me with His love. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And His opening of me became my salvation; and I ran in His way in His peace, even in the way of truth: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  From the beginning and even to the end I acquired His knowledge: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me up: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord plenteously: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I drank and was inebriated with the living water that doth not die; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And my inebriation was not one without knowledge, but I forsook vanity and turned to the Most High my God, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I was enriched by His bounty, and I forsook the folly which is diffused over the earth; and I stripped it off and cast it from me: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the Lord renewed me in His raiment, and possessed me by His light, and from above He gave me rest in incorruption; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I became like the land which blossoms and rejoices in its fruits: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the Lord was like the sun shining on the face of the land; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He lightened my eyes, and my face received the dew; and my nostrils enjoyed the pleasant odour of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And He carried me to His Paradise; where is the abundance of the pleasure of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I worshipped the Lord on account of His glory; and I said, Blessed, O Lord, are they who are planted in thy land! and those who have a place in thy Paradise; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And they grow by the fruits of the trees. And they have changed from darkness to light. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Behold! all thy servants are fair, who do good works, and turn away from wickedness to the pleasantness that is thine: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And they have turned back the bitterness of the trees from them, when they were planted in thy, land; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And everything became like a relic of thyself, and memorial for ever of thy faithful works. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For there is abundant room in thy Paradise, and nothing is useless therein; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But everything is filled with fruit; glory be to thee, O God, the delight of Paradise for ever. Hallelujah. </p>
