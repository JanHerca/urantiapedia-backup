<p> <i>Again reminiscent of the Psalms, of David.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Lord is my hope: in Him I shall not be confounded. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For according to His praise He made me, and according to His goodness even so He gave unto me: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And according to His mercies He exalted me: and according to His excellent beauty He set me on high: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And brought me up out of the depths of Sheol: and from the mouth of death He drew me: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And thou didst lay my enemies low, and He justified me by His grace. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I believed in the Lord's Messiah: and it appeared to me that He is the Lord; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And He showed him His sign: and He led me by His light, and gave me the rod of His power; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  That I might subdue the imaginations of the peoples; and the power of the men of might to bring them low: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  To make war by His word, and to take victory by His power. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the Lord overthrew my enemy by His word: and he became like the stubble which the wind carries away; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I gave praise to the Most High because He exalted me His servant and the son of His handmaid. Hallelujah. </p>
