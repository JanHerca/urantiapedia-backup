<p> <i>A man who had a spiritual experience brings a message.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My heart was lifted up in the love of the Most High and was enlarged: that I might praise Him for His name's sake. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My members were strengthened that they might not fall from His strength. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sicknesses removed from my body, and it stood to the Lord by His will. For His kingdom is true. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Lord, for the sake of them that are deficient do not remove thy word from me! </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Neither for the sake of their works do thou restrain from me thy perfection! </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let not the luminary be conquered by the darkness; nor let truth flee away from falsehood. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou wilt appoint me to victory; our Salvation is thy right hand. And thou wilt receive men from all quarters. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And thou wilt preserve whosoever is held in evils: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou art my God. Falsehood and death are not in thy mouth: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thy will is perfection; and vanity thou knowest not, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Nor does it know thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And error thou knowest not, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Neither does it know thee. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And ignorance appeared like a blind man; and like the foam of the sea, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And they supposed of that vain thing that it was something great; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And they too came in likeness of it and became vain; and those have understood who have known and meditated; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And they have not been corrupt in their imagination; for such were in the mind of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And they mocked at them that were walking in error; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And they spake truth from the inspiration which the Most High breathed into them; Praise and great comeliness to His name Hallelujah. </p>
