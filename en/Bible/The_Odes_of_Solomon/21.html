<p> <i>A remarkable explanation of the “coats of skin” in the third chapter of Genesis.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My arms I lifted up to the Most High, even to the grace of the Lord: because He had cast off my bonds from me: and my Helper had lifted me up to His grace and to His salvation: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I put off darkness and clothed myself with light, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And my soul acquired a body free from sorrow or affliction or pains. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And increasingly helpful to me was the thought of the Lord, and His fellowship in incorruption: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I was lifted up in His light; and I served before Him, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I became near to Him, praising and confessing Him; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  My heart ran over and was found in my mouth: and it arose upon my lips; and the exultation of the Lord increased on my face, and His praise likewise. Hallelujah. </p>
