<p> <i>The reference to the sealed document sent by God is one of the great mysteries of the collection.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Joy is of the saints! and who shall put it on, but they alone? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Grace is of the elect! and who shall receive it except those who trust in it from the beginning? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Love is of the elect? And who shall put it on except those who have possessed it from the beginning? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Walk ye in the knowledge of the Most High without grudging: to His exultation and to the perfection of His knowledge. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And His thought was like a letter; His will descended from on high, and it was sent like an arrow which is violently shot from the bow: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And many hands rushed to the letter to seize it and to take and read it: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And it escaped their fingers and they were affrighted at it and at the seal that was upon it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Because it was not permitted to them to loose its seal: for the power that was over the seal was greater than they. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But those who saw it went after the letter that they might know where it would alight, and who should read it and who should hear it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But a wheel received it and came over it: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And there was with it a sign of the Kingdom and of the Government: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And everything which tried to move the wheel it mowed and cut down: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And it gathered the multitude of adversaries, and bridged the rivers and crossed over and rooted up many forests and made a broad path. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The head went down to the feet, for down to the feet ran the wheel, and that which was a sign upon it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The letter was one of command, for there were included in it all districts; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And there was seen at its head, the head which was revealed even the Son of Truth from the Most High Father, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And He inherited and took possession of everything. And the thought of many was brought to nought. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And all the apostates hasted and fled away. And those who persecuted and were enraged became extinct. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the letter was a great volume, which was wholly written by the finger of God: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the name of the Father was on it, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, to rule for ever and ever. Hallelujah. </p>
