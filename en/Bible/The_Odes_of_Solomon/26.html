<p> <i>Remarkable praise.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I poured out praise to the Lord, for I am His: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I will speak His holy song, for my heart is with Him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For His harp is in my hands, and the Odes of His rest shall not be silent. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will cry unto him from my whole heart: I will praise and exalt Him with all my members. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For from the east and even to the west is His praise: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And from the south and even to the north is the confession of Him: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And from the top of the hills to their utmost bound is His perfection. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Who can write the Psalms of the Lord, or who read them? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Or who can train his soul for life, that his soul may be saved, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Or who can rest on the Most High, so that with His mouth he may speak? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Who is able to interpret the wonders of the Lord? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For he who could interpret would be dissolved and would become that which is interpreted. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For it suffices to know and to rest: for in rest the singers stand, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Like a river which has an abundant fountain, and flows to the help of them that seek it. Hallelujah. </p>
