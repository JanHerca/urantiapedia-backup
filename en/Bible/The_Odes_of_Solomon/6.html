<p> <i>First century universalism is revealed in an interesting way in verse 10.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the hand moves over the harp, and the strings speak. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak by His love. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For it destroys what is foreign, and everything that is bitter: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thus it was from the beginning and will be to the end, that nothing should be His adversary, and nothing should stand up against Him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Lord has multiplied the knowledge of Himself, and is zealous that these things should be known, which by His grace have been given to us. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the praise of His name He gave us: our spirits praise His holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For there went forth a stream and became a river great and broad; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For it flooded and broke up everything and it brought (water) to the Temple: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the restrainers of the children of men were not able to restrain it, nor the arts of those whose business it is to restrain waters; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For it spread over the face of the whole earth, and filled everything: and all the thirsty upon earth were given to drink of it; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And thirst was relieved and quenched: for from the Most High the draught was given. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Blessed then are the ministers of that draught who are entrusted with that water of His: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They have assuaged the dry lips, and the will that had fainted they have raised up; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And souls that were near departing they have caught back from death: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And limbs that had fallen they straightened and set up: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They gave strength for their feebleness and light to their eyes: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For everyone knew them in the Lord, and they lived by the water of life for ever. Hallelujah. </p>
