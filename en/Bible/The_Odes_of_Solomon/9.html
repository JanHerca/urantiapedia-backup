<p> <i>We shall never know surely whether the wars referred to here are spiritual or actual outward wars.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Open your ears and I will speak to you. Give me your souls that I may also give you my soul, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The word of the Lord and His good pleasures, the holy thought which He has devised concerning his Messiah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For in the will of the Lord is your salvation, and His thought is everlasting life; and your end is immortality. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Be enriched in God the Father, and receive the thought of the Most High. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be strong and be redeemed by His grace. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I announce to you peace, to you His saints; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That none of those who hear may fall in war, and that those again who have known Him may not perish, and that those who receive may not be ashamed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  An everlasting crown for ever is Truth. Blessed are they who set it on their heads: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A stone of great price is it; and there have been wars on account of the crown. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And righteousness hath taken it and hath given it to you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Put on the crown in the true covenant of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And all those who have conquered shall be written in His book. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For their book is victory which is yours. And she (Victory) sees you before her and wills that you shall be saved. Hallelujah. </p>
