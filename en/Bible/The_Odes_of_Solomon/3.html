<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  .    .    .   I put on: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And his members are with him. And on them do I stand, and He loves me: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I should not have known how to love the Lord, if He had not loved me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For who is able to distinguish love, except the one that is loved? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I love the Beloved, and my soul loves Him: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And where His rest is, there also am I; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I shall be no stranger, for with the Lord Most High and Merciful there is no grudging. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I have been united to I-run, for the Lover has found the Beloved, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And because I shall love Him that, is the Son, I shall become a son; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For he that is joined to Him that is immortal, will also himself become immortal; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he who has pleasure in the Living One, will become living. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  This is the Spirit of the Lord, which doth not lie, which teacheth the sons of men to know His ways. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be wise and understanding and vigilant. Hallelujah. </p>
