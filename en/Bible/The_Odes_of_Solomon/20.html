<p> <i>A mixture of ethics and mysticism; of the golden rule and the tree of life.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I am a priest of the Lord, and to Him I do priestly service: and to Him I offer the sacrifice of His thought. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For His thought is not like the thought of the world nor the thought of the flesh, nor like them that serve carnally. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The sacrifice of the Lord is righteousness, and purity of heart and lips. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Present your reins before Him blamelessly: and let not thy heart do violence to heart, nor thy soul to soul. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou shalt not acquire a stranger by the price of thy silver, neither shalt thou seek to devour thy neighbour, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Neither shalt thou deprive him of the covering of his nakedness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But put on the grace of the Lord without stint; and come into His Paradise and make thee a garland from its tree, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And put it on thy head and be glad; and recline on His rest, and glory shall go before thee, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And thou shalt receive of His kindness and of His grace; and thou shalt be flourishing in truth in the praise of His holiness. Praise and honour be to His name. Hallelujah. </p>
