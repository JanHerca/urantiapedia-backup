<p> <i>This Ode is a musical gem.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the wings of doves over their nestlings; and the mouth of their nestlings towards their mouths. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So also are the wings of the Spirit over my heart: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My heart is delighted and exults: like the babe who exults in the womb of his mother: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I believed; therefore I was at rest; for faithful is He in whom I have believed: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He has richly blessed me and my head is with Him: and the sword shall not divide me from Him, nor the scimitar; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I am ready before destruction comes; and I have been set on His immortal pinions: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And He showed me His sign: forth and given me to drink, and from that life is the spirit within me, and it cannot die, for it lives. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They who saw me marvelled at me, because I was persecuted, and they supposed that I was swallowed up: for I seemed to them as one of the lost; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And my oppression became my salvation; and I was their reprobation because there was no zeal in me; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Because I did good to every man I was hated, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they came round me like mad dogs, who ignorantly attack their masters, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For their thought is corrupt and their understanding perverted. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But I was carrying water in my right hand, and their bitterness I endured by my sweetness; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I did not perish, for I was not their brother nor was my birth like theirs. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And they sought for my death and did not find it: for I was older than the memorial of them; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And vainly did they make attack upon me and those who, without reward, came after me: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They sought to destroy the memorial of him who was before them. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For the thought of the Most High cannot be anticipated; and His heart is superior to all wisdom. Hallelujah. </p>
