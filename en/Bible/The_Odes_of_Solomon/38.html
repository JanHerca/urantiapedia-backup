<p> <i>A beautiful description of the power of truth.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I went up to the light of truth as if into a chariot: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the Truth took me and led me: and carried me across pits and gulleys; and from the rocks and the waves it preserved me: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And it became to me a haven of Salvation: and set me on the arms of immortal life: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And it went with me and made me rest, and suffered me not to wander, because it was the Truth; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I ran no risk, because I walked with Him; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I did not make an error in anything because I obeyed the Truth. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For Error flees away from it, and meets it not: but the Truth proceeds in the right path, and </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whatever I did not know, it made clear to me, all the poisons of error, and the plagues of death which they think to be sweetness: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I saw the destroyer of destruction, when the bride who is corrupted is adorned: and the bridegroom who corrupts and is corrupted; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I asked the Truth ‘Who are these?’; and He said to me, 'This is the deceiver and the error: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they are alike in the beloved and in his bride: and they lead astray and corrupt the whole world: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they invite many to the banquet, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And give them to drink of the wine of their intoxication, and remove their wisdom and knowledge, and so they make them without intelligence; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And then they leave them; and then these go about like madmen corrupting: seeing that-they are without heart, nor do they seek for it! </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I was made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the deceiver; and I congratulated myself because the Truth went with me, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I was established and lived and was redeemed, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And my foundations were laid on the hand of the Lord: because He established me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For He set the root and watered it and fixed it and blessed it; and its fruits are for ever. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  It struck deep and sprung up and spread out, and was full and enlarged; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the Lord alone was glorified in His planting and in His husbandry: by His care and by the blessing of His lips, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  By the beautiful planting of His right hand: and by the discovery of His planting, and by the thought of His mind. Hallelujah. </p>
