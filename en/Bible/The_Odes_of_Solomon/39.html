<p> <i>One of the few allusions to events in the Gospelsâ€”that of our Lord walking on the Sea of Galilee.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Great rivers are the power of the Lord: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they carry headlong those who despise Him: and entangle their paths: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they sweep away their fords, and catch their bodies and destroy their lives. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For they are more swift than lightning and more rapid, and those who cross them in faith are not moved; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And those who walk on them without blemish shall not be afraid. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the sign in them is the Lord; and the sign is the way of those who cross in the name of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Put on, therefore, the name of the Most High, and know Him, and you shall cross without danger, for the rivers will be subject to you. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The Lord has bridged them by His word; and He walked and crossed them on foot: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And His footsteps stand firm on the water, and are not injured; they are as firm as a tree that is truly set up. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the waves were lifted up on this side and on that, but the footsteps of our Lord Messiah stand firm and are not obliterated and are not defaced. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And a way has been appointed for those who cross after Him and for those who adhere to the course of faith in Him and worship His name. Hallelujah. </p>
