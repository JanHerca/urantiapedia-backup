<p> <i>A vigorous little Ode in which Christ Himself is the speaker.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Lord hath directed my mouth by His word: and He hath opened my heart by His light: and He hath caused to dwell in me His deathless life; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And gave me that I might speak the fruit of His peace: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To convert the souls of them who are willing to come to Him; and to lead captive a good captivity for freedom. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I was strengthened and made mighty and took the world captive; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And it became to me for the praise of the Most High, and of God my Father. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the Gentiles were gathered together who were scattered abroad. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I was unpolluted by my love for them, because they confessed me in high places: and the traces of the light were set upon their heart: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And they walked in my life and were saved and became my people for ever and ever. Hallelujah. </p>
