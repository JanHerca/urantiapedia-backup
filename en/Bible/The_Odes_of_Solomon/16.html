<p> <i>The beauty of God's creation.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the work of the husbandman is the ploughshare: and the work of the steersman is the guidance of the ship: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So also my work is the Psalm of the Lord: my craft and my occupation are in His praises: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because His love bath nourished my heart, and even to my lips His fruits He poured out. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For my love is the Lord, and therefore I will sing unto Him: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For I am made strong in His praise, and I have faith in Him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I will open my mouth and His spirit will utter in me the glory of the Lord and His beauty; the work of His hands and the operation of His fingers: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The multitude of His mercies and the strength of His word. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For the word of the Lord searches out all things, both the invisible and that which reveals His thought; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the eye sees His works, and the ear hears His thought; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He spread out the earth and He settled the waters in the sea: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He measured the heavens and fixed the stars: and He established the creation and set it up: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And He rested from His works: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And created things run in their courses, and do their works: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And they know not how to stand and be idle; and His heavenly hosts are subject to His word. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The treasure-chamber of the light is the sun, and the treasury of the darkness is the night: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And He made the sun for the day that it may be bright, but night brings darkness over the face of the land; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And their alternations one to the other speak the beauty of God: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  IS And there is nothing that is without the Lord; for He was before any thing came into being: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the worlds were made by His word, and by the thought of His heart. Glory and honour to His name. Hallelujah. </p>
