<p> <i>One of the loveliest Odes in this unusual collection.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the sun is the joy to them that seek for its daybreak, so is my joy the Lord; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Because He is my Sun and His rays have lifted me up; and His light hath dispelled all darkness from my face. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In Him I have acquired eyes and have seen His holy day: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ears have become mine and I have heard His truth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The thought of knowledge hath been mine, and I have been delighted through Him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The way of error I have left, and have walked towards Him and have received salvation from Him, without grudging. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And according to His bounty He hath given to me, and according to His excellent beauty He hath made me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I have put on incorruption through His name: and have put oft corruption by His grace. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Death hath been destroyed before my face: and Sheol hath been abolished by my word: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And there hath gone up deathless life in the Lord's land, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And it hath been made known to His faithful ones, and hath been given without stint to all those that trust in Him. Hallelujah. </p>
