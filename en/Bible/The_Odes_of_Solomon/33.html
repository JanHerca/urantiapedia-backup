<p> <i>A virgin stands and proclaims (v. 5).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Again Grace ran and forsook corruption, and came down in Him to bring it to nought; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He destroyed perdition from before Him, and devastated all its order; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And He stood on a lofty summit and uttered His voice from one end of the earth to the other: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And drew to Him all those who obeyed Him; and there did not appear as it were an evil person. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But there stood a perfect virgin who was proclaiming and calling and saying, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O ye sons of men, return ye, and ye daughters of men, come ye: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And forsake the ways of that corruption and draw near unto me, and I will enter into you, and will bring you forth from perdition, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And make you wise in the ways of truth: that you be not destroyed nor perish: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hear ye me and be redeemed. For the grace of God I am telling among you: and by my means you shall be redeemed and become blessed. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I am your judge; and they who have put me on shall not be injured: but they shall possess the new world that is incorrupt: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My chosen ones walk in me, and my ways I will make known to them that seek me, and I will make them trust in my name. Hallelujah. </p>
