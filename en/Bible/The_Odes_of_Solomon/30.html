<p> <i>An invitation to the thirsty.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Fill ye waters for yourselves from the living fountain of the Lord, for it is opened to you: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And come all ye thirsty, and take the draught; and rest by the fountain of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For fair it is and pure and gives rest to the soul. Much more pleasant are its waters than honey; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For it flows forth from the lips of the Lord and from the heart of the Lord is its name. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And it came infinitely and invisibly: and until it was set in the midst they did not know it: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Blessed are they who have drunk therefrom and have found rest thereby. Hallelujah. </p>
