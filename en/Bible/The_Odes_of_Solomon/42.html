<p> <i>The Odes of Solomon, the Son of David, are ended with the following exquisite verses.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I stretched out my hands and approached my Lord: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the stretching of my hands is His sign: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My expansion is the outspread tree which was set up on the way of the Righteous One. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I became of no account to those who did not take hold of me; and I shall be with those who love me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  All my persecutors are dead; and they sought after me who hoped in me, because I was alive: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I rose up and am with them; and I will speak by their mouths. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For they have despised those who persecuted them; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I lifted up over them the yoke of my love; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Like the arm of the bridegroom over the bride, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So was my yoke over those that know me: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And as the couch that is spread in the house of the bridegroom and bride, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So is my love over those that believe in me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And I was not rejected though I was reckoned to be so. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I did not perish, though they devised it against me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Sheol saw me and was made miserable: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Death cast me up, and many along with me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I had gall and bitterness, and I went down with him to the utmost of his depth: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the feet and the head he let go, for they were not able to endure my face: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I made a congregation of living men amongst his dead men, and I spake with them by living lips: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Because my word shall not be void: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And those who had died ran towards me: and they cried and said, Son of God, have pity on us, and do with us according to thy kindness, </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And bring us out from the bonds of darkness: and open to us the door by which we shall come out to thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For we see that our death has not touched thee. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Let us also be redeemed with thee: for thou art our Redeemer. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And I heard their voice; and my name I sealed upon their heads: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For they are free men and they are mine. Hallelujah. </p>
