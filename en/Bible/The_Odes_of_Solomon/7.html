<p> <i>A wonderfully, simple and joyful psalm on the Incarnation.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As the impulse of anger against evil, so is the impulse of joy over what is lovely, and brings in of its fruits without restraint: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My joy is the Lord and my impulse is toward Him: this path of mine is excellent: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I have a helper, the Lord. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He hath caused me to know Himself, without grudging, by His simplicity: His kindness has humbled His greatness. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He became like me, in order that I might receive Him: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He was reckoned like myself in order that I might put Him on; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I trembled not when I saw Him: because He was gracious to me: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Like my nature He became that I might learn Him and like my form, that I might not turn back from Him: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Father of knowledge is the word of knowledge: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He who created wisdom is wiser than His works: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And He who created me when yet I was not knew what I should do when I came into being: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wherefore He pitied me in His abundant grace: and granted me to ask from Him and to receive from His sacrifice: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Because He it is that is incorrupt, the fulness of the ages and the Father of them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He hath given Him to be seen of them that are His, in order that they may recognize Him that made them: and that they might not suppose that they came of themselves: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For knowledge He hath appointed as its way, He hath widened it and extended it; and brought to all perfection; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And set over it the traces of His light, and I walked therein from the beginning even to the end. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For by Him it was wrought, and He was resting in the Son, and for its salvation He will take hold of everything; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the Most High shall be known in His Saints, to announce to those that have songs of the coming of the Lord; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  That they may go forth to meet Him, and may sing to Him with joy and with the harp of many tones: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The seers shall come before Him and they shall be seen before Him, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And they shall praise the Lord for His love: because He is near and beholdeth. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And hatred shall be taken from the earth, and along with jealousy it shall be drowned: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For ignorance hath been destroyed, because the knowledge of the Lord hath arrived. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They who make songs shall sing the grace of the Lord Most High; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And they shall bring their songs, and their heart shall be like the day: and like the excellent beauty of the Lord their pleasant song: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And there shall neither be anything that breathes without knowledge, nor any that is dumb: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For He hath given a mouth to His creation, to open the voice of the mouth towards Him, to praise Him: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Confess ye His power, and show forth His grace. Hallelujah. </p>
