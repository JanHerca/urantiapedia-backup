<p> <i>Fantastic and not in harmony with the other Odes. The reference to a painless Virgin Birth is notable.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A cup of milk was offered to me: and I drank it in the sweetness of the delight of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Son is the cup, and He who was milked is the Father: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the Holy Spirit milked Him: because His breasts were full, and it was necessary for Him that His milk should be sufficiently released; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the Holy Spirit opened His bosom and mingled the milk from the two breasts of the Father; and gave the mixture to the world without their knowing: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they who receive in its fulness are the ones on the right hand. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Spirit opened the womb of the Virgin and she received conception and brought forth; and the Virgin became a Mother with many mercies; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And she travailed and brought forth a Son, without incurring pain; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And because she was not sufficiently prepared, and she had not sought a midwife (for He brought her to bear) she brought forth, as if she were a man, of her own will; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And she brought Him forth openly, and acquired Him with great dignity, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And loved Him in His swaddling clothes and guarded Him kindly, and showed Him in Majesty. Hallelujah. </p>
