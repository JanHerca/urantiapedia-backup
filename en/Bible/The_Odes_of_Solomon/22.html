<p> <i>Like the Psalms of David in their exultation because of freedom.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He who brought me down from on high, also brought me up from the regions below; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He who gathers together the things that are betwixt is He also who cast me down: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He who scattered my enemies had existed from ancient and my adversaries: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He who gave me authority over bonds that I might loose them; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that overthrew by my hands the dragon with seven heads: and thou hast set me over his roots that I might destroy his seed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou wast there and didst help me, and in every place thy name was a rampart me </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thy right hand destroyed his wicked poison; and thy hand levelled the way for those who believe in thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And thou didst choose them from the graves and didst separate them from the dead. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou didst take dead bones and didst cover them with bodies. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They were motionless, and thou didst give them energy for life. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thy way was without corruption, and thy face; thou didst bring thy world to corruption: that everything might be dissolved, and then renewed, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And that the foundation for everything might be thy rock: and on it thou didst build thy kingdom; and it became the dwelling place of the saints. Hallelujah. </p>
