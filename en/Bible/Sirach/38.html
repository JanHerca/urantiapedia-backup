<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With such doth he heal [men,] and taketh away their pains. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  There is a time when in their hands there is good success. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down: </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  But they will maintain the state of the world, and [all] their desire is in the work of their craft. </p>
