<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty? </p>
