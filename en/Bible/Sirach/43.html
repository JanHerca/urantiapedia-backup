<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of the most High: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales created. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is his power. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is? </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom. </p>
