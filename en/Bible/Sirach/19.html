<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that hateth babbling shall have less evil. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a word within a fool's belly. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, and believe not every tale. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the most High. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted [of him,] and wisdom obtaineth his love. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the performance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there is a fool wanting in wisdom. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will do evil. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  A man may be known by his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is. </p>
