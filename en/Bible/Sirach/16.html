<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again. </p>
