<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Blessed is the man that hath not slipped with his mouth, and is not pricked with the multitude of sins. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should an envious man do with money? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  There is none worse than he that envieth himself; and this is a recompence of his wickedness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; and at the last he will declare his wickedness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face, and despiseth men. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A wicked eye envieth [his] bread, and he is a niggard at his table. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, and give the Lord his due offering. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that the covenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Do good unto thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability stretch out thy hand and give to him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass thee. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thy labours to be divided by lot? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Blessed is the man that doth meditate good things in wisdom, and that reasoneth of holy things by his understanding. ing. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He that considereth her ways in his heart shall also have understanding in her secrets. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Go after her as one that traceth, and lie in wait in her ways. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He that prieth in at her windows shall also hearken at her doors. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell. </p>
