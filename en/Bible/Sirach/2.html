<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways! </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy. </p>
