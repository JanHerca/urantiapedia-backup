<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin. </p>
