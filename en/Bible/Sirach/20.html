<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both? </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide. </p>
