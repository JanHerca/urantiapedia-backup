<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was present. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him [to drink.] </p>
