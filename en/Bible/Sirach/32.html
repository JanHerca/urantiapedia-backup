<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of musick with pleasant wine. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favour. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee home without delay. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin not by proud speech. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And for these things bless him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favour. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuse according to his will. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath done without counsel. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done, repent not. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble not among the stones. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Be not confident in a plain way. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And beware of thine own children. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse. </p>
