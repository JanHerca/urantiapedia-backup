<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful man shall have them both. </p>
