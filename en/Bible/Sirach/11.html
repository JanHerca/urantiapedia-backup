<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the crown. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men's hands. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good works, are from him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Error and darkness had their beginning together with sinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Like as a partridge taken [and kept] in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own. </p>
