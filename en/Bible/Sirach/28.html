<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins [in remembrance.] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruption and death, and abide in the commandments. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour: [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a furious man will kindle strife, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived them of their labours. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were better than it. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neither shall they be burned with the flame thereof. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold, </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait. </p>
