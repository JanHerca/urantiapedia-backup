<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel! </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  [Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go. </p>
