<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the most High. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Give unto the good, and help not the sinner. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but in his adversity even a friend will depart. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and be pricked therewith. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance. </p>
