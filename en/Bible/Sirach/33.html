<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Why doth one day excel another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Some of them hath he made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them hath he made ordinary days. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and made their ways diverse. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as liketh him best. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So look upon all the works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and tred my winepress like a gatherer of grapes. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another: lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same again. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For better it is that thy children should seek to thee, than that thou shouldest stand to their courtesy. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  In all thy works keep to thyself the preeminence; leave not a stain in thine honour. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant. . </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: but if thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for idleness teacheth much evil. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion do nothing. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself, because thou hast bought him with a price. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for thou hast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou entreat him evil, and he run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek him? </p>
