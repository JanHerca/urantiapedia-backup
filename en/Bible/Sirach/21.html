<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh speedily. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A foolish man's foot is soon in his [neighbour's] house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth. </p>
