<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thy substance. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things that are precious in her. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thine inheritance. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neither wander thou in the solitary place thereof. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not upon another's beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; for herewith love is kindled as a fire. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor sit down with her in thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thine heart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall into destruction. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most High. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people for his speech. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated. </p>
