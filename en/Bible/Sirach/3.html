<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay. </p>
