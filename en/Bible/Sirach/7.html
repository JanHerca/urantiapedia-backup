<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one which humbleth and exalteth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like to thy friend. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make not much babbling when thou prayest. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tarry long. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worms. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. nor the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not of liberty. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thyself cheerful toward them. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but give not thyself over to a light woman. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thou recompense them the things that they have done for thee? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him his portion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing may be perfected. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Be not slow to visit the sick: fir that shall make thee to be beloved. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss. </p>
