<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shall not see her. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannot remember her. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord will prosper it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God love it not. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall be given him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knoweth every work of man. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin. </p>
