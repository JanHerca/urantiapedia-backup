<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will declare wisdom. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saveth them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before his father's eyes. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him? </p>
