<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst of her people. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a possession. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portion of the Lord's inheritance. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance than the honeycomb. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom. </p>
