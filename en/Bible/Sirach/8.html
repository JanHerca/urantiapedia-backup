<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall into his hands. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us wax old. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction, and how to serve great men with ease. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give answer as need requireth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Rise not up [in anger] at the presence of an injurious person, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for him according to his honour. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he become grievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will, and thou shalt perish with him through his folly. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help, he will overthrow thee. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest not what he will bring forth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Open not thine heart to every man, lest he requite thee with a shrewd turn. </p>
