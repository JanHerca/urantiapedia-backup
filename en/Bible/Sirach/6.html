<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A faithfu1l friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire. </p>
