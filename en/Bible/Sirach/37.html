<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is a friend, which is only a friend in name. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them continually. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats: </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life. </p>
