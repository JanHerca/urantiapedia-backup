<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [in danger] that delivered him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men's business for gain shall fall into suits. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender. </p>
