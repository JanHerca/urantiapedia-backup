<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of all men living. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst of women. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be established for his glory. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  All things are double one against another: and he hath made nothing imperfect. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding his glory? </p>
