<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his friends. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled at every cry. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his follies. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet. </p>
