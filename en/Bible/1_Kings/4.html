<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And king Solomon was king over all Israel. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, [and] the king's friend; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all the land of Hepher); </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife); </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him [pertained] the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to him [pertained] the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars); </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife); </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and [he was] the only officer that was in the land. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. </p>
