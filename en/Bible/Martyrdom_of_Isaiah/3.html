<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Belchira recognized and saw the place of Isaiah and the prophets who were with him; for he dwelt in the region of Bethlehem, and was an adherent of Manasseh. And he prophesied falsely in Jerusalem, and many belonging to Jerusalem were confederate with him, and he was a Samaritan. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And it came to pass when Alagar Zagar, king of Assyria, had come and captured Samaria and taken the nine (and a half) tribes captive, and led them away to the mountains of the Medes and the rivers of Tazon; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  this (Belchira) while still a youth, had escaped and come to Jerusalem in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, but he walked not in the ways of his father of Samaria; for he feared Hezekiah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he was found in the days of Hezekiah speaking words of lawlessness in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the servants of Hezekiah accused him, and he made his escape to the region of Bethlehem. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they persuaded . . . And Belchira accused Isaiah and the prophets who were with him, saying: ‘Isaiah and those who are with him prophesy against Jerusalem and against the cities of Judah that they shall be laid waste and (against the children of Judah and) Benjamin also that they shall go into captivity, and also against thee, O lord the king, that thou shalt go (bound) with hooks and iron chains’: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But they prophesy falsely against Israel and Judah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Isaiah himself hath said: ‘I see more than Moses the prophet.’ </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But Moses said: ‘No man can see God and live’: and Isaiah hath said: ‘I have seen God and behold I live.’ </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Know, therefore, O king, that he is lying. And Jerusalem also he hath called Sodom, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem he hath declared to be the people of Gomorrah. And he brought many accusations against Isaiah and the prophets before Manasseh. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But Beliar dwelt in the heart of Manasseh and in the heart of the princes of Judah and Benjamin and of the eunuchs and of the councillors of the king. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the words of Belchira pleased him [exceedingly], and he sent and seized Isaiah. </p>
