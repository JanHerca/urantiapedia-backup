<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah that he </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  called Manasseh his son. Now he was his only one. And he called him into the presence of Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet; and into the presence of Josab the son of Isaiah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And whilst he (Hezekiah) gave commands, Josab the son of Isaiah standing by, Isaiah said to Hezekiah the king, but not in the presence of Manasseh only did he say unto him: ‘As the Lord liveth, whose name has not been sent into this world, [and as the Beloved of my Lord liveth], and as the Spirit which speaketh in me liveth, all these commands and these words shall be made of none effect by Manasseh thy son, and through the agency of his hands I shall depart mid the torture of my body. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Sammael Malchira shall serve Manasseh, and execute all his desire, and he shall become a follower of Beliar rather than of me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And many in Jerusalem and in Judaea he shall cause to abandon the true faith, and Beliar shall dwell in Manasseh, and by his hands I shall be sawn asunder. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And when Hezekiah heard these words he wept very bitterly, and rent his garments, and placed earth upon his head, and fell on his face. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Isaiah said unto him: ‘The counsel of Sammael against Manasseh is consummated: nought shall avail thee.’ </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And on that day Hezekiah resolved in his heart to slay Manasseh his son. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Isaiah said to Hezekiah: [‘The Beloved hath made of none effect thy design, and] the purpose of thy heart shall not be accomplished, for with this calling have I been called [and I shall inherit the heritage of the Beloved’]. </p>
