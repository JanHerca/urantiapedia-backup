<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass after that Hezekiah died and Manasseh became king, that he did not remember the commands of Hezekiah his father but forgat them, and Sammael abode in Manasseh and clung fast to him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Manasseh forsook the service of the God of his father, and he served Satan and his angels and his powers. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he turned aside the house of his father which had been before the face of Hezekiah the words of wisdom and from the service of God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Beliar; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Beliar, whose name is Matanbuchus. And he delighted in Jerusalem because of Manasseh, and he made him strong in apostatizing (Israel) and in the lawlessness which was spread abroad in Jerusalem </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And witchcraft and magic increased and divination and augulation, and fornication, [and adultery], and the persecution of the righteous by Manasseh and [Belachira, and] Tobia the Canaanite, and John of Anathoth, and by (Zadok) the chief of the works. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the rest of the acts, behold they are written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when Isaiah the soll of Amoz saw the lawlessness which was being perpetratcd in Jerusalem and the worship of Satan and his wantonness, he withdrew from Jerusalem and settled in Bethlehem of Judah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And there also there was much lawlessness, and withdrawing from Bethlehem he settled on a mountain in a desert place. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [And Micaiah the prophet, and the aged Ananias, and Joel and Habakkuk, and his son Josab, and many of the faithful who believed in the ascension into heaven, withdrew and settled on the mountain.] </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They were all clothed with garments of hair, and they were all prophets. And they had nothing with them but were naked, and they all lamented with a great lamentation because of the going astray of Israel. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And these eat nothing save wild herbs which they gathered on the mountains, and having cooked them, they lived thereon together with Isaiah the prophet. And they spent two years of days on the mountains and hills. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And after this, whilst they were in thc desert, there was a certain man in Samaria named Belchira, of the family of Zedekiah, the son of Chenaan, a false prophet whose dwelling was in Bethlehem. Now Hezekiah the son of Chanani, who was the brother of his father, and in the days of Ahab king of Israel had been the teacher of the 400 prophets of Baal, had himself smitten and reproved Micaiah the son of Amada the prophet. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he, Micaiah, had been reproved by Ahab and cast into prison. (And he was) with Zedekiah the prophet: they were with Ahaziah the son of Ahab, king in Samaria. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Elijah the prophet of Tebon of Gilead was reproving Ahaziah and Samaria, and prophesied regarding Ahaziah that he should die on his bed of sickness, and that Samaria should be delivered into the hand of Leba Nasr because he had slain the prophets of God. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And when the false prophets, who were with Ahaziah the son of Ahab and their teacher Gemarias of Mount Joel had heard </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  -now he was brother of Zedekiah -when they had heard, they persuaded Ahaziah the king of Aguaron and slew Micaiah. </p>
