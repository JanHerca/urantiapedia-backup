<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he sawed him asunder with a wood-saw. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder Balchlra stood up, accusing him, and all the false prophets stood up, laughing and rejoicing because of Isaiah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Balchlra, with the aid of Mechembechus, stood up before Isaiah, [laughing] deriding; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Belchira said to Isaiah: ‘Say: “I have lied in all that I have spoken, and likewise the ways of Manasseh are good and right. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the ways also of Balchlra and of his associates are good.”’ </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And this he said to him when he began to be sawn in sunder. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Isaiah was (absorbed) in a vision of the Lord, and though his eyes were open, he saw them . </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Balchlra spake thus to Isaiah: ‘Say what I say unto thee and I will turn their heart, and I will compel Manasseh and the princes of Judah and the people and all Jerusalem to reverence thee.’ </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Isaiah answered and said: ‘So far as I have utterance (I say): Damned and accursed be thou and all thy powers and all thy house. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thou canst not take (from me) aught save the skin of my body.’ </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they seized and sawed in sunder Isaiah, the son of Amoz, with a wood-saw. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Manasseh and Balchlra and the false prophets and the princes and the people [and] all stood looking on. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And to the prophets who were with him he said before he had been sawn in sunder: ‘Go ye to the region of Tyre and Sidon; for for me only hath God mingled the cup.’ </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder, he neither cried aloud nor wept, but his lips spake with the Holy Spirit until he was sawn in twain. </p>
