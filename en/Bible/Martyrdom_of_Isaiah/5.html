<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he sawed him asunder with a wood-saw. And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder Balchlra stood up, accusing him, and all the false prophets stood up, laughing and rejoicing because </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  of Isaiah. And Balchlra, with the aid of Mechembechus, stood up before Isaiah, [laughing] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  deriding; And Belchlra said to Isaiah: ‘Say: “I have lied in all that I have spoken, and likewise </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  the ways of Manasseh are good and right. And the ways also of Balchlra and of his associates are </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  good.”’ And this he said to him when he began to be sawn in sunder. But Isaiah was (absorbed) </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  in a vision of the Lord, and though his eyes were open, he saw them . And Balchlra spake thus to Isaiah: ‘Say what I say unto thee and I will turn their heart, and I will compel Manasseh </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and the princes of Judah and the people and all Jerusalem to reverence thee.’ And Isaiah answered and said: ‘So far as I have utterance (I say): Damned and accursed be thou and all thy powers and </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  all thy house. For thou canst not take (from me) aught save the skin of my body.’ And they </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  seized and sawed in sunder Isaiah, the son of Amoz, with a wood-saw. And Manasseh and </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Balchlra and the false prophets and the princes and the people [and] all stood looking on. And to the prophets who were with him he said before he had been sawn in sunder: ‘Go ye to the region </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  of Tyre and Sidon; for for me only hath God mingled the cup.’ And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder, he neither cried aloud nor wept, but his lips spake with the Holy Spirit until he was sawn in twain. </p>
