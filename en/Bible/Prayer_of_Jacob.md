## Description

“Prayer of Jacob”

_From “The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volume 2”,  James H. Charlesworth (1985)_

James Charlesworth writes: “There is no reason to doubt that Greek is the original language. The time of composition must antedate the fourth century, the date of the papyrus. Parallels with second-century documents (see below) indicate that the prayer may be as early as the second century A.D.; if the Prayer of Joseph dates from the first century (as J. Z. Smith states in his contribution above) then the Prayer of Jacob may also be that early. Since the papyrus was acquired in Cairo, venerates Sinai, and shares ideas with many other Egyptian documents and papyri, it is reasonable to assume an Egyptian provenance.” (The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, vol. 2, p. 715)
