<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, [namely], of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. </p>
