<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do; <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes: <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. </p>
