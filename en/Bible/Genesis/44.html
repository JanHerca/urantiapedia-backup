<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father. </p>
