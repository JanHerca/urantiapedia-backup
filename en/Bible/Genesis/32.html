<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  then thou shalt say [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
