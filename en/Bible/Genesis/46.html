<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. </p>

<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him. </p>

<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. </p>
