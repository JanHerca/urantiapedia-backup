<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem). </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. </p>
