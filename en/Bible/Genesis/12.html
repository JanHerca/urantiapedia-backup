<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had. </p>
