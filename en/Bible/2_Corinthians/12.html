<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth), </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in [my] weaknesses. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or heareth from me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for [my] power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except [it be] that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, [are] for your edifying. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means [there should be] strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed. </p>
