<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you? <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But if the ministration of death, written, [and] engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which [glory] was passing away: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For if that which passeth away [was] with glory, much more that which remaineth [is] in glory. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and [are] not as Moses, [who] put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed [to them] that it is done away in Christ. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
