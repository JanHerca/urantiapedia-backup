<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But this [I say,] He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [Let] each man [do] according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  seeing that through the proving [of you] by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of [your] contribution unto them and unto all; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
