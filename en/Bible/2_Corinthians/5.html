<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  (for we walk by faith, not by sight); <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but [speak] as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know [him so] no more. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Wherefore if any man is in Christ, [he is] a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation; <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech [you] on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Him who knew no sin he made [to be] sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
