<p> <i>Asenath is introduced to Jacob.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And, when the seven years of plenty had passed, the seven years of famine began to come. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And, when Jacob heard about Joseph his son, he came into Egypt with all his kindred in the second year of the famine, in the second month, on the twenty-first of the month, and settled in Geshem. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Asenath said to Joseph: “I will go and see thy father, for that thy father Israel is as my father and God.” And Joseph said to her: “Thou shalt go with me and see my father.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Joseph and Asenath came to Jacob in the land of Geshem, and Joseph's brethren met them and made obeisance to them upon their faces on the earth. Then both went in to Jacob; and Jacob was sitting upon his bed, and he himself was an old man in a lusty old age. And, when Asenath saw him, she marvelled at his beauty, for that Jacob was beautiful to behold exceedingly and his old age as the youth of a comely man, and all his head was white like snow, and the hairs of his head were all close and thick exceedingly, and his beard white reaching to his breast, his eyes cheerful and glistering, his sinews and his shoulders and his arms as of an angel, his thighs and his calves and his feet as of a giant. Then Asenath, when she saw him thus, marvelled and fell down and made obeisance on her face upon the earth. And Jacob said to Joseph: “Is this my daughter-in-law, thy wife? Blessed shall she be of God Most High.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Jacob called Asenath to himself and blessed her and kissed her tenderly; and Asenath stretched out her hands and took hold of Jacob's neck and hung on to his neck and kissed him tenderly. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And after these things they ate and drank. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thereupon both Joseph and Asenath went to their house; and Simeon and Levi, the sons of Leah, alone conducted them forth, but the sons of Balla and Zelpha, the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, did not join in conducting them forth, for that they envied and detested them. And Levi was at Asenath's right and Simeon at her left. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Asenath took hold of Levi's hand, for that she loved him exceedingly above all Joseph's brethren and as a prophet and a worshipper of God and one who feared the Lord. For he was an understanding man and a prophet of the Most High, and he himself saw letters written in heaven and read them and revealed them to Asenath in secret; for that Levi himself also loved Asenath much and saw the place of her rest in the highest. </p>
