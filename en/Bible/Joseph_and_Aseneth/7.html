<p> <i>Joseph sees Asenath at the Window.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Joseph came into the house of Pentephres and sat upon a chair. And they washed his feet, and set a table before him separately, for that Joseph did not eat with the Egyptians, since this was an abomination to him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Joseph looked up and saw Asenath peeping out, and he saith to Pentephres: “Who is that woman who is standing in the loft by the window ? Let her go away from this house.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For Joseph feared, saying: “Lest she herself also annoy me.” For all the wives and daughters of the princes and the satraps of all the land of Egypt used to annoy him in order that they might lie with him; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but many wives and daughters of the Egyptians also, as many as beheld Joseph, were distressed on account of his beauty; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and the envoys whom the women sent to him with gold and silver and precious gifts Joseph sent back with threatening and insult, saying: “I will not sin in the sight of the Lord God and the face of my father Israel.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For Joseph had God alway before his eyes and ever remembered the injunctions of his father; for Jacob often spake and admonished his son Joseph and all his sons: “Keep yourselves, children, securely from a strange woman so as not to have fellowship with her, for fellowship with her is ruin and destruction.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore Joseph said: “Let that woman depart from this house.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Pentephres said to him: “My lord, that woman whom thou hast seen standing in the loft is not a stranger, but is our daughter, one who hateth every man, and no other man hath ever seen her save thou only to-day; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and, if thou wishest, lord, she shall come and speak to thee, for that our daughter is as thy sister.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Joseph rejoiced with exceeding great joy, for that Pentephres said: “She is a virgin hating every man.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Joseph said to Pentephres and his wife: “If she is your daughter, and is a virgin, let her come, for that she is my sister, and I love her from to-day as my sister.” </p>
