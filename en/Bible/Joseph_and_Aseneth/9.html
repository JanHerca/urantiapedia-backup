<p> <i>Asenath retires and Joseph prepares to depart.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Asenath rejoiced over the blessing of Joseph with exceeding great joy. Then she hasted and came up into her loft by herself, and fell upon her bed in infirmity, for that there was in her joy and sorrow and great fear; and a continuous sweat was poured over her when she heard these words from Joseph, and when he spake to her in the name of God Most High. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then she wept with great and bitter weeping, and she turned in penitence from her gods whom she was wont to worship, and the idols, which she spurned, and waited for evening to come. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Joseph ate and drank; and he told his serving-men to yoke the horses to their chariots, and to go round all the land. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Pentephres said to Joseph: “Let my lord lodge here to-day, and in the morning thou shalt go thy way.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Joseph said: “Nay, but I will go away to-day, for that this is the day on which God began to make all His created things, and on the eighth day I also return to you and will lodge here.” </p>
