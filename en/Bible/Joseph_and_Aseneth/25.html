<p> <i>Pharaoh's Son goes to kill his Father, but is not admitted. Nephthalim and Asher protest to Dan and Gad against the Conspiracy.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Pharaoh's son rose up the same night and came to his father's bed-chamber to slay him with the sword. His father's guards thereupon hindered him from coming in to his father and said to him: “What commandest thou, lord ?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Pharaoh's son said to them: “I wish to see my father, for that I am going to gather the vintage of my new-planted vineyard.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the guards said to him: “Thy father suffereth pain and lay awake the whole night and now resteth, and he said to us that no one was to come in to him not even if it is my firstborn son.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he on hearing these things went away in wrath and straightway took mounted bowmen fifty in number and went away before them as Dan and Gad had said to him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the younger brethren Nephthalim and Asher spake to their elder brethren Dan and Gad, saying: “Wherefore do ye on your part again work wickedness against your father Israel and against your brother Joseph ? And God preserveth him as the apple of an eye. Lo ! </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  did ye not once sell Joseph ? and he is king to-day of all the land of Egypt and food-giver. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now therefore, if ye again wish to work wickedness against him, he will cry unto the Most High and he will send fire from heaven and it will devour you, and the angels of God will fight against you.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then the elder brethren were moved to anger against them and said: “And shall we die as women ? Far be it.” And they went out to meet Joseph and Asenath. </p>
