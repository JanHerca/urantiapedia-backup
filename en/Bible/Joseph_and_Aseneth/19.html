<p> <i>Joseph returns and is received by Asenath.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And, while they were yet speaking these things, a boy came saying to Asenath: “Lo ! Joseph standeth before the doors of our court.” Then Asenath hasted and went down the stairs from her loft with the seven virgins to meet Joseph and stood in the porch of her house. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And, Joseph having come into the court, the gates were shut and all strangers remained outside. And Asenath came out from the porch to meet Joseph, and when he saw her he marvelled at her beauty, and said to her: “Who art thou, damsel ? Quickly tell me.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And she saith to him: “I, lord, am thine handmaid Asenath; all the idols I have cast away from me and they perished. And a man came to me to-day from heaven and hath given me bread of life and I ate, and I drank a blessed cup, and he said to me: I have given thee for a bride to Joseph, and he himself shall be thy bridegroom for ever; and thy name shall not be called Asenath, but it shall be called ‘City of Refuge,’ and the Lord God shall reign over many nations, and through thee shall they seek refuge with God Most High.” And the man said: “I will go also to Joseph that I may speak into his ears these words concerning thee. And now thou knowest, lord, if that man hath come to thee and if he hath spoken to thee concerning me.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Joseph saith to Asenath: “Blessed art thou, woman, of God Most High, and blessed is thy name for ever, for that the Lord God hath laid the foundations of thy walls, and the sons of the living God shall dwell in thy city of refuge, and the Lord God shall reign over them for ever. For that man came from heaven to me to-day and said these words to me concerning thee. And now come hither to me, thou virgin and pure, and wherefore standest thou afar off ?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Joseph stretched out his hands and embraced Asenath, and Asenath Joseph, and they kissed one another for a long time, and both lived again in their spirit. And Joseph kissed Asenath and gave her the spirit of life, then the second time he gave her the spirit of wisdom, and the third time he kissed her tenderly and gave her the spirit of truth. </p>
