<p> <i>Asenath's Face is transformed.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And, while Asenath was yet speaking these words to herself, lo ! a young man, one of the servants of Joseph, saying: “Joseph, the mighty man of God, cometh to you to-day.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And straightway Asenath called the overseer of her house and said to him: “Haste and prepare mine house and make a good dinner ready, for that Joseph, the mighty man of God, cometh to us to-day.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the overseer of the house when he saw her (for her face had shrunk from the seven days' affliction and weeping and abstinence) sorrowed and wept; and he took hold of her right hand and kissed it tenderly and said: “What aileth thee, my lady, that thy face is thus shrunken ?” And she said: “I have had great pain about mine head, and sleep departed from mine eyes.” Then the overseer of the house went away and prepared the house and the dinner. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Asenath remembered the angel's words and his injunctions, and hasted and entered her second chamber, where the chests of her adorning were, and opened her great coffer and brought out her first robe like lightning to behold and put it on; and she girded herself also with a girdle bright and royal that was of gold and precious stones, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and on her hands she put golden bracelets, and upon her feet golden buskins, and a precious ornament about her neck, and a golden wreath she put about her head; and on the wreath as upon its front was a great sapphire stone, and round the great stone six stones of great price, and with a very marvellous mantle she veiled her head. And, when Asenath remembered the words of the overseer of her house, for that he said to her that her face had shrunk, she sorrowed exceedingly, and groaned and said: “Woe is me, the lowly one, since my face is shrunken. Joseph will see me thus and I shall be set at naught by him.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And she saith to her handmaid, “Bring me pure water from the fountain.” And, when she had brought it, she poured it out into the basin, and, bending down to wash her face, she seeth her own face shining like the sun, and her eyes as the morning-star when it riseth, and her cheeks .as a star of heaven, and her lips as red roses, the hairs of her head were as the vine that bloometh among his fruits in the paradise of God, her neck as an all-variegated cypress. And Asenath, when she saw these things, marvelled in herself at the sight and rejoiced with exceeding great joy and washed not her face, for she said, “Lest I wash off this great and comely beauty.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The overseer of her house then came back to tell her, “All things are done that thou commandedst”; and, when he beheld her, he feared greatly and was seized with trembling for a long time, and he fell at her feet and began to say: “What is this, my mistress? What is this beauty that surroundeth thee that is great and marvellous ? Hath the Lord God of Heaven chosen thee as bride for his son Joseph ?” </p>
