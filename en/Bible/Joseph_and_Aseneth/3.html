<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass in the first year of the seven years of plenty, in the fourth month, on the twenty-eighth of the month, that Joseph came to the borders of Heliopolis collecting the corn of that district. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And, when Joseph drew near to that city, he sent twelve men before him to Pentephres, the priest of Heliopolis, saying: “I will come in to thee to-day, because it is the time of noon and of the midday meal, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and there is great heat of the sun, and that I may cool myself under the roof of thine house.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Pentephres, when he heard these things, rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “Blessed be the Lord God of Joseph, because my lord Joseph hath thought me worthy.” And Pentephres called the overseer of his house and said to him: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “Haste and make mine house ready, and prepare a great dinner, because Joseph the mighty one of God cometh to us to-day.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And, when Asenath heard that her father and mother had come from the possession of their inheritance, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  she rejoiced greatly and said: “I will go and see my father and mother, because they have come from the possession of our inheritance” (for that it was the harvest-season). </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Asenath hasted into her chamber where her robes lay and put on a fine linen robe made of crimson stuff and interwoven with gold, and girded herself with a golden girdle, and bracelets round her hands; and about her feet she put golden buskins, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and round her neck she cast an ornament of great price and precious stones, which were embellished on all sides, having also the names of the gods of the Egyptians everywhere engraved on them, both on the bracelets and the stones; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and she put also a tiara on her head and bound a diadem round her temples and covered her head with a mantle. </p>
