<p> <i>The Men with Pharaoh's Son and those with Dan and Gad are killed; and the four Brothers flee to the Ravine and their Swords are stricken from their Hands.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Benjamin was sitting with her on the chariot on the right side; and Benjamin was a strong lad of about nineteen years, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and upon him was ineffable beauty and might as of a lion's whelp, and he was also one who feared God exceedingly. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Benjamin leaped down from the chariot, and took a round stone from the ravine and filled his hand and hurled at Pharaoh's son and smote his left temple, and wounded him with a grievous wound, and he fell from his horse upon the earth half-dead. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And thereupon Benjamin, having run up on to a rock, saith to Asenath's chariot-man: “Give me stones from the ravine.” And he gave him fifty stones. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Benjamin hurled the stones and slew the fifty men who were with Pharaoh's son, all the stones sinking in through their temples. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then the sons of Leah, Reuben and Simeon, Levi and Judah, Issachar and Zebulon, pursued after the men who had lain in wait against Asenath and fell upon them unawares and cut them all down; and the six men slew two thousand and seventy-six men. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the sons of Balla and Zelpha fled from their face and said: “We have perished at the hands of our brethren, and Pharaoh's son hath also died by the hand of Benjamin the lad, and all who were with him perished by the hand of the boy Benjamin. Accordingly, therefore, come let us slay Asenath and Benjamin and flee to the thicket of these reeds.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And they came against Asenath holding their swords drawn covered with blood. And Asenath when she saw them feared greatly and said: “Lord God, who quickenedst me and deliveredst me from the idols and the corruption of death, even as thou saidst to me that my soul shall live for ever, deliver me now also from these wicked men.” And the Lord God heard Asenath's voice, and straightway the swords of the adversaries fell from their hands upon the earth and were turned into ashes. </p>
