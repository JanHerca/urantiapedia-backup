<p> <i>Joseph blesses Asenath.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then her mother went up into the loft and brought Asenath to Joseph, and Pentephres said to her: “Kiss thy brother, because he also is a virgin even as thou to-day, and hateth every strange woman even as thou hatest every strange man.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Asenath said to Joseph: “Hail, lord, blessed of God Most High.” And Joseph said to her: “God who quickeneth all things shall bless thee, damsel.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Pentephres saith then to his daughter Asenath: “Come and kiss thy brother.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When Asenath then came up to kiss Joseph, Joseph stretched forth his right hand, and laid it on her breast between her two paps (for her paps were already standing forth like lovely apples), and Joseph said: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “It is not meet for a man that worshippeth God, who blesseth with his mouth the living God, and eateth the blessed bread of life, and drinketh the blessed cup of immortality, and is anointed with the blessed unction of incorruption, to kiss a strange woman, who blesseth with her mouth dead and deaf idols and eateth from their table the bread of strangling and drinketh from their libation the cup of deceit and is anointed with the unction of destruction; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but the man that worshippeth God will kiss his mother and the sister who is born of his mother and the sister who is born of his tribe and the wife who shareth his couch, who bless with their mouth the living God. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Likewise also it is not meet for a woman that worshippeth God to kiss a strange man, for that this is an abomination in the sight of the Lord God.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And, when Asenath heard these words from Joseph, she was sore distressed and groaned; and, as she was looking steadfastly at Joseph with her eyes open, they were filled with tears. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Joseph, when he saw her weeping, pitied her exceedingly, for that he was mild and merciful and one who feared the Lord. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then he lifted up his right hand above her head and said: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and quicken her, and renew her with thy holy spirit, </p>
