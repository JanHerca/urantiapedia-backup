<p> <i>Michael departs.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the angel saith to Asenath, “Hast thou seen this thing ?” And she said, “Yea, my lord, I have seen all these things.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The divine angel saith to her: “So shall be all my words as many as I have spoken to thee to-day.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then the angel of the Lord for the third time stretched forth his right hand and touched the side of the comb, and straightway fire came up from the table and devoured the comb, but the table it injured not a whit. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And, when much fragrance had come forth from the burning of the comb and filled the chamber, Asenath said to the divine angel: “Lord, I have seven virgins who were brought up with me from my youth and were born on one night with me, who wait upon me, and I love them all as my sisters. I will call them and thou shalt bless them too, even as thou blesscdst me.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the angel said to her: “Call them.” Then Asenath called the seven virgins and set them before the angel, and the angel said to them: “The Lord God Most High shall bless you, and ye shall be [pillars] of refuge of seven cities, and all the elect of that city who dwell together shall [upon you rest] for ever.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And after these things ‘the divine’ angel saith to Asenath: “Take away this table.” And, when Asenath turned to remove the table, straightway he departed from her eyes, and Asenath saw as it were a chariot with four horses that were going eastward to heaven, and the chariot was as a flame of fire, and the horses as lightning, and the angel was standing above that chariot. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then Asenath said: “Silly and foolish am I, the lowly one, for that I have spoken as that a man came into my chamber from heaven,! knew not that God came into it; and lo ! now he goeth back to heaven to his place.” And she said in herself: “Be gracious, Lord, to thy bondmaid, and spare thine handmaid, because, for my part, I have in ignorance spoken rash things before thee.” </p>
