<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when Asenath saw Joseph she was sore pricked in the soul and her heart was crushed, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and her knees were loosed and her whole body trembled and she feared with great fear, and then she groaned and said in her heart: “Alas me miserable ! where now shall I, the wretched one, go away ? or where shall I be hidden from his face ? or how shall Joseph the son of God see me, for that on my part I have spoken evil things about him ? Alas me miserable ! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  whither shall I go away and be hidden, because he himself seeth every hiding-place, and knoweth all things, and no hidden thing escapeth him by reason of the great light that is in him ? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And now may the God of Joseph be gracious to me because in ignorance I have spoken wicked words against him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What now shall I, the wretched one, follow? Have I not said: ‘Joseph cometh, the son of the shepherd from the land of Canaan’ ? Now therefore he hath come to us in his chariot as the sun from heaven, and he entered our house to-day, and he shineth into it like light upon the earth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But I am foolish and bold, because I scorned him and spake evil words about him and did not know that Joseph is a son of God. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For who among men will ever beget such beauty, or what womb of woman will give birth to such light ? Wretched am I and foolish, because I have spoken evil words to my father. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Now, therefore, let my father give me to Joseph for an handmaid and a bondwoman rather, and I will be in bondage to him for ever.” </p>
