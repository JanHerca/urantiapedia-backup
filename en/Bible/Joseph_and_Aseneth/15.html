<p> <i>Michael tells Asenath that she shall be Joseph's Wife.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And thereupon she came to the divine chief captain and stood before him, and the angel of the Lord saith to her: “Take now the mantle from thine head, for that thou art to-day a pure virgin, and thine head is as of a young man.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Asenath took it from her head. And again the divine angel saith to her: " Be of good cheer, Asenath, the virgin and pure, for lo ! the Lord God heard all the words of thy confession and thy prayer, and he hath seen also the humiliation and affliction of the seven days of thine abstinence, for that from thy tears much clay hath been formed before thy face upon these cinders. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Accordingly, be of good cheer, Asenath, the virgin and pure, for lo ! thy name hath been written in the book of life and shall not be blotted out for ever; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but from this day thou shalt be renewed and refashioned and re-quickened, and thou shalt eat the blessed bread of life and drink a cup filled with immortality and be anointed with the blessed unction of incorruption. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be of good cheer, Asenath, the virgin and pure, lo ! the Lord God hath given thee to-day to Joseph for a bride, and he himself shall be thy bridecrroom for ever. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And no more henceforth shalt thou be called Asenath, but thy name shall be City of Refuge, for that in thee many nations shall seek refuge and they shall lodge under thy wings, and many nations shall find shelter by thy means, and upon thy walls they who cleave unto God Most High through penitence shall be kept secure; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  for that Penitence is daughter of the Most High, and she herself entreateth God Most High for thee every hour and for all that repent, since he is father of Penitence, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and she herself is the completion and overseer of all virgins, loving you exceedingly and beseeching the Most High for you every hour, and for all who repent she will provide a place of rest in the heavens, and she reneweth everyone who hath repented. And Penitence is exceeding fair, a virgin pure and gentle and mild; and therefore God Most High loveth her, and all the angels revere her, and I love her exceedingly, for that she herself also is my sister, and as she loveth you virgins I also love you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And lo ! for my part I go to Joseph and will speak to him all these words concerning thee, and he will come to thee to-day and see thee and rejoice over thee and love thee and be thy bridegroom, and thou shalt be his beloved bride for ever. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Accordingly hear me, Asenath, and put on a wedding robe, the ancient and first robe that is yet laid up in thy chamber from of old, and put all thy choice adorning also about thee, and adorn thyself as a good bride and make thyself ready to meet him; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  for lo ! he himself cometh to thee to-day and will see thee and rejoice.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And, when the angel of the Lord in the shape of a man had finished speaking these words to Asenath, she rejoiced with great joy over all the things that were spoken by him, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and fell upon her face upon the earth, and made obeisance before his feet and said to him: “Blessed is the Lord thy God who sent thee to deliver me from the darkness and to bring me from the foundations of the abyss itself into the light, and blessed is thy name for ever. If then I have found grace, my lord, in thy sight and shall know that thou wilt perform all the words which thou hast said to me so that they be accomplished, let thine handmaid speak to thee.” And the angel saith to her, “Say on.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And she said: “I pray thee, lord, sit down a little time upon this bed, because this bed is pure and undefiled, for that another man or other woman never sat upon it, and I will set before thee a table and bread, and thou shalt eat, and I will bring thee also wine old and good, the odour whereof shall reach unto heaven, and thou shalt drink thereof and thereafter shalt depart upon thy way.” And he saith to her: “Haste and bring it quickly.” </p>
