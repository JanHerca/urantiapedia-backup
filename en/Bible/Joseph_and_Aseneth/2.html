<p> <i>The Tower in which Asenath lives is described.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But Asenath set at naught and scorned every man, being boastful and haughty, and never had a man seen her, inasmuch as Pentephres had in his house a tower adjoining, great and high exceedingly, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and above the tower was a loft containing ten chambers. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the first chamber was great and very lovely and paved with purple stones, and the walls thereof were faced with precious and many-coloured stones, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and the roof also of that chamber was of gold. And within that chamber gods of the Egyptians, whereof was no number, gold and silver, were fixed, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and all those Asenath worshipped, and she feared them, and she performed sacrifices to them every day. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the second chamber also contained all Asenath's adorning and chests, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and there was gold in it, and much silver and gold-woven raiment unlimited, and stones choice and of great price, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and fine garments of linen, and all the adornment of her virginity was there. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the third chamber was Asenath's storehouse, containing all the good things of the earth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the remaining seven chambers the seven virgins who ministered to Asenath occupied, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  each one having one chamber, for that they were of the same age, born on the same night with Asenath, and she loved them much; and they were also beautiful exceedingly as the stars of heaven, and never did a man converse with them or a male child. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now Asenath's great chamber where her virginity was fostered had three windows; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and the first window was very large, looking over the court to the east; and the second looked toward the south, and the third looked over the street. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And a golden bedstead stood in the chamber looking toward the east; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and the bed was laid with purple stuff interwoven with gold, the bed being woven of scarlet and crimson stuff and fine linen. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  On this bed Asenath alone slept, and never had man or other woman sat thereon. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And there was also a great court adjoining the house all round, and an exceeding high wall round the court built of great rectangular stones; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and there were also four gates in the court overlaid with iron, and these were kept each by eighteen strong young men armed; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and there were also planted along the wall fair trees of all kinds and all bearing fruit, their fruit being ripe, for it was the season of harvest; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and there was also a rich fount of water springing from the right of the same court; and beneath the fount was a great cistern receiving the water of that fount, whence there went, as it were, a river through the midst of the court and it watered all the trees of that court. </p>
