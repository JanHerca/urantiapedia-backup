<p> <i>The Conspirators kill Asenath's Guards and she flees.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Asenath rose in the morning and said to Joseph: “I am going to the possession of our inheritance as thou hast said; but my soul feareth exceedingly for that thou art parting from me.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Joseph said to her: “Be of good cheer and be not afraid, but rather go away rejoicing, in dread of no man whatsoever, for that the Lord is with thee and he himself will preserve thee as the apple of an eye from every evil. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I will set forth for my giving of food and will give to all the men in the city, and no man shall perish of hunger in the land of Egypt.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Asenath departed on her way, and Joseph for his giving of food. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And, when Asenath reached the place of the ravine with the six hundred men, suddenly they who were with Pharaoh's son came forth from their ambush and joined battle with those who were with Asenath, and cut them all down with their swords, and all her forerunners they slew, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but Asenath fled with her chariot. Then Levi, the son of Leah, knew all these things rjy the spirit as a prophet and told his brethren of Asenath's danger, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and straightway each of them took his sword upon his thigh and their shields upon their arms and the spears in their right hands and pursued after Asenath with great speed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And, as Asenath was fleeing before, lo ! Pharaoh's son met her and fifty horsemen with him: and Asenath, when she saw him, was seized with very great fear and was trembling, and she called upon the name of the Lord her God. </p>
