<p> <i>Pharaoh's Son dies. Pharaoh also dies and Joseph succeeds him.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Pharaoh's son rose from the earth and sat up and spat blood from his mouth; for the blood was running down from his temple into his mouth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Benjamin ran up to him and took his sword and drew it from Pharaoh's son's sheath (for Benjamin was not wearing a sword upon his thigh) and wished to smite Pharaoh's son upon the breast. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Levi ran up to him and took hold of his hand and said: “In no wise, brother, do this thing, for that we are men who worship God, and it is not meet for a man who worshippeth God to render evil for evil, nor to trample upon one who hath fallen, nor utterly to crush his enemy even unto death. And now put back the sword into his place, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and come and help me, and let us heal him of this wound; and, if he live, he will be our friend and his father Pharaoh will be our father.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Levi raised Pharaoh's son from the earth and washed away the blood from his face and tied a bandage over his wound and set him upon his horse and led him to his father Pharaoh, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  relating to him all the things that had happened and befallen. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Pharaoh arose from his throne and made obeisance to Levi upon the earth and blessed him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then, when the third day had passed, Pharaoh's son died from the stone wherewith he was wounded by Benjamin. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Pharaoh mourned for his firstborn son exceedingly, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  whence from the grief Pharaoh fell sick and died at 109 years, and he left his diadem to the all-beauteous Joseph. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Joseph reigned alone in Egypt 48 years; and after these things Joseph gave back the diadem to Pharaoh's younger child, who was at the breast when the old man Pharaoh died. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Joseph was thenceforth as father of Pharaoh's younger child in Egypt till his death, glorifying and praising God. </p>
