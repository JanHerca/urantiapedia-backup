<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were [as] of old. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a [sure] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou didst march though the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. Selah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And will make me to walk upon my high places. </p>
