<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass after seven days, that the word of God carne to me, and said unto me: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  ‘Tell Jeremiah to go and support the captivity of the people unto Babylon. But do you remain here amid the desolation of Zion, and I will show to you after these days ‘what will befall at the end of days.’ And I said to Jeremiah as the Lord commanded me. And he, indeed, departed with the people, but I, Baruch, returned and sat before the gates of the temple, and I lamented with the following lamentation over Zion and said: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Blessed is he who was not born, </p>
<p> Or he, who having been born, has died. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But as for us who live, woe unto us, </p>
<p> Because we see the afflictions of Zion, </p>
<p> And what has befallen Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I will call the Sirens from the sea, </p>
<p> And you Lilin, come you from the desert, </p>
<p> And you Shedim and dragons from the forests: </p>
<p> Awake and gird up your loins unto mourning, </p>
<p> And take up with me the dirges, </p>
<p> And make lamentation with me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ye husbandmen, sow not again; </p>
<p> And, O earth, wherefore give you your harvest fruits? </p>
<p> Keep within you the sweets of your sustenance. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And thou, vine, why further do you give your wine; </p>
<p> For an offering will not again be made from there in Zion, </p>
<p> Nor will first-fruits again be offered. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And do ye, O heavens, withhold your dew, </p>
<p> And open not the treasuries of rain: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And do thou, O sun withhold the light of your rays. </p>
<p> And do thou, O moon, extinguish the multitude of your light; </p>
<p> For why should light rise again </p>
<p> Where the light of Zion is darkened? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And you, you bridegrooms, enter not in, </p>
<p> And let not the brides adorn themselves with garlands; </p>
<p> And, you women, pray not that you may bear. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the barren shall above all rejoice, </p>
<p> And those who have no sons shall be glad, </p>
<p> And those who have sons shall have anguish. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For why should they bear in pain, </p>
<p> Only to bury in grief? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Or why, again, should mankind have sons? </p>
<p> Or why should the seed of their kind again be named, </p>
<p> Where this mother is desolate, </p>
<p> And her sons are led into captivity? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  From this time forward speak not of beauty, </p>
<p> And discourse not of gracefulness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Moreover, you priests take you the keys of the sanctuary, </p>
<p> And cast them into the height of heaven, </p>
<p> And give them to the Lord and say: </p>
<p> “Guard Your house Thyself, </p>
<p> For lo! we are found false stewards.” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And you, you virgins; who weave fine linen </p>
<p> And silk with gold of Ophir, </p>
<p> Take with haste all (these) things </p>
<p> And cast (them) into the fire, </p>
<p> That it may bear them to Him who made them, </p>
<p> And the flame send them to Him who created them, </p>
<p> Lest the enemy get possession of them.’ </p>
