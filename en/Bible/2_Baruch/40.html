<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The last leader of that time will be left alive, when the multitude of his hosts will be put to the sword, and he will be bound, and they will take him up to Mount Zion, and My Messiah will convict him of all his impieties, and will gather and set before him all the works of his hosts. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And afterwards he will put him to death, and protect the rest of My people which shall be found in the place which I have chosen. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And his principate will stand for ever, until the world of corruption is at an end, and until the times aforesaid are fulfilled. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This is your vision, and this is its interpretation. </p>
