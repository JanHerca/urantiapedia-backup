<p> <i>OXY = OXYRHYNCHUS GREEK FRAGMENT, from Grenfell and Hunt's Oxyrhynchus Papyri, vol. iii. 3-7, 1903. Verso.</i> </p>
<p> <i>Second Fast. Revelation as to the coming judgment on the Heathen.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  [And it came to pass after these things, that I, Baruch, was standing upon Mount Zion, and lo! a voice came from the height and said unto me:] [OXY: And it came to pass after these things that I, Baruch, was standing upon Mount Zion, and lo a voice came forth from the height and said unto me:] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [‘Stand upon your feet, Baruch, and hear the word of the mighty God.’] [OXY: ‘Stand upon your feet, Baruch, and hear the word of the mighty God.’] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because you have been astonished at what has befallen Zion, you shall therefore be assuredly preserved to the consummation of the times, that you may be for a testimony. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So that, if ever those prosperous cities say: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  ‘Why hath the mighty God brought upon us this retribution?’ Say you to them, you and those like you who shall have seen this evil: ‘(This is the evil) and retribution which is coming upon you and upon your people in its (destined) time that the nations may be thoroughly smitten. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And then they shall be in anguish. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if they say at that time: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For how long? you will say to them: </p>
<p> “Ye who have drunk the strained wine, </p>
<p> Drink you also of its dregs, </p>
<p> The judgment of the Lofty One </p>
<p> Who has no respect of persons.”’ </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  On this account he had aforetime no mercy on His own sons, </p>
<p> But afflicted them as His enemies, because they sinned, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then therefore were they chastened </p>
<p> That they might be sanctified. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  [But now, you peoples and nations, you are guilty] [OXY: (Ye) peoples and . . .] </p>
<p> [Because you have always trodden down the earth,] [OXY: (Ye) have trodden down the earth] </p>
<p> [And used the creation unrighteously.] [OXY: And misused the created things in it.] </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  [For I have always benefited you.] [OXY: For you were always being benefited] </p>
<p> [And you have always been ungrateful for the bene­ficence.] [OXY: But you were always ungrateful.] </p>
