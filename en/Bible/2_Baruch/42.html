<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And He answered and said unto me: ‘These things also will I show unto you. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As for what you did say—“To whom will these things be, and how many (will they be)? ”—to those who have believed there shall be the good which was spoken of aforetime, and to those who despise there shall be the contrary of these things. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And as for what you did say regarding those who have drawn near and those who have withdrawn this in the word. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As for those who were before subject, and afterwards withdrew and mingled themselves with the seed of mingled peoples, the time of these was the former, and was accounted as something exalted. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And as for those who before knew not but afterwards knew life, and mingled (only) with the seed of the people which had separated itself, the time of these (is) the latter, and is accounted as something exalted. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And time shall succeed to time and season to season, and one shall receive from another, and then with a view to the consummation shall everything be compared according to the measure of the times and the hours of the seasons. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For corruption shall take those that belong to it, and life those that belong to it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the dust shall be called, and there shall be said to it: “Give back that which is not yours, and raise up all that you have kept until its time”.’' </p>
