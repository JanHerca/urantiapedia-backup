<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the black seventh waters which you have seen, this is the perversion (brought about) by the counsel of Jeroboam, who took counsel to make two calves of gold: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And all the iniquities which kings who were after him iniquitously wrought. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the curse of Jezebel and the worship of idols which Israel practiced at that time. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the withholding of rain, and the famines which occurred until women eat the fruit of their wombs. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the time of their captivity which came upon the nine tribes and a half, because they were in many sins. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Shalmanezzar king of Assyria came and led them away captive. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But regarding the Gentiles it were tedious to tell how they always wrought impiety and wickedness, and never wrought righteousness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  These are the black seventh waters which you have seen. </p>
