<p> <i>Baruch told of his Death and bidden to give his last Commands to the People</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But, do thou, Baruch, direct your heart to that which has been said to you, </p>
<p> And understand those things which have been shown to you; </p>
<p> For there are many eternal consolations for you. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For you shall depart from this place, </p>
<p> And you shall pass from the regions which are now seen by you, </p>
<p> And you shall forget whatever is corruptible, </p>
<p> And shall not again recall those things which happen among mortals. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Go therefore and command your people, and come to this place, and afterwards fast seven days, and then I will come to you and speak with you. </p>
<p> <i>Baruch tells the Elders of his impending Death, but encourages them to expect the Consolation of Zion</i> </p>
