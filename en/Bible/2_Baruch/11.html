<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover, I, Baruch, say this against you, Babylon: </p>
<p> ‘If you had prospered, </p>
<p> And Zion had dwelt in her glory, </p>
<p> Yet the grief to us had been great </p>
<p> That you should be equal to Zion. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But now, lo! the grief is infinite, </p>
<p> And the lamentation measureless, </p>
<p> For lo! you are prospered </p>
<p> And Zion desolate. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who will be judge regarding these things? </p>
<p> Or to whom shall we complain regarding that which has befallen us? </p>
<p> O Lord, how have you borne (it)? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Our fathers went to rest without grief, </p>
<p> And lo! the righteous sleep in the earth in tranquility; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For they knew not this anguish, </p>
<p> Nor yet had they heard of that which had befallen us. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Would that you had ears, O earth, </p>
<p> And that you had a heart, O dust: </p>
<p> That you might go and announce in Sheol, </p>
<p> And say to the dead: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “Blessed are you more than we who live.”’ </p>
