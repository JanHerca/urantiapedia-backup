<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I, Baruch, went from thence, and came to my people, and I called my first-born son and [the Gedaliahs] my friends, and seven of the elders of the people, and I said unto them: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Behold, I go unto my fathers </p>
<p> According to the way of all the earth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But withdraw you not from the way of the law, </p>
<p> But guard and admonish the people which remain, </p>
<p> Lest they withdraw from the commandments of the Mighty One. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For you see that He whom we serve is just, </p>
<p> And our Creator is no respecter of persons. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And see you what hath befallen Zion, </p>
<p> And what hath happened to Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the judgment of the Mighty One shall (thereby) be made known, </p>
<p> And His ways, which, though past finding out, are right. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For if you endure and persevere in His fear, </p>
<p> And do not forget His law, </p>
<p> The times shall change over you for good. </p>
<p> And you shall see the consolation of Zion. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Because whatever is now is nothing, </p>
<p> But that which shall be is very great. </p>
<p> For everything that is corruptible shall pass away, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And everything that dies shall depart, </p>
<p> And all the present time shall be forgotten, </p>
<p> Nor shall there be any remembrance of the present time, which is defiled with evils. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For that which runs now runs unto vanity, </p>
<p> And that which prospers shall quickly fall and be humiliated. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For that which is to be shall be the object of desire, </p>
<p> And for that which comes afterwards shall we hope; </p>
<p> For it is a time that passes not away, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the hour comes which abides for ever. </p>
<p> And the new world (comes) which does not turn to corruption those who depart to its blessedness, </p>
<p> And has no mercy on those who depart to torment, </p>
<p> And leads not to perdition those who live in it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For these are they who shall inherit that time which has been spoken of, </p>
<p> And theirs is the inheritance of the promised time. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  These are they who have acquired for themselves treasures of wisdom, </p>
<p> And with them are found stores of understanding, </p>
<p> And from mercy have they not withdrawn, </p>
<p> And the truth of the law I have they preserved. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For to them shall be given the world to come, </p>
<p> But the dwelling of the rest who are many shall be in the fire. </p>
