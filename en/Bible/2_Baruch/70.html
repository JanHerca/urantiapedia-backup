<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear therefore the interpretation of the last black waters which are to come [after the black]: this the word. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Behold! the days come, and it shall be when the time of the age has ripened, </p>
<p> And the harvest of its evil and good seeds has come, </p>
<p> That the Mighty One will bring upon the earth and its inhabitants and upon its rulers </p>
<p> Perturbation of spirit and stupor of heart. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they shall hate one another, </p>
<p> And provoke one another to fight, </p>
<p> And the mean shall rule over the honorable, </p>
<p> And those of low degree shall be extolled above the famous. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the many shall be delivered into the hands of the few, </p>
<p> And those who were nothing shall rule over the strong, </p>
<p> And the poor shall have abundance beyond the rich, </p>
<p> And the impious shall exalt themselves above the heroic. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the wise shall be silent, </p>
<p> And the foolish shall speak, </p>
<p> Neither shall the thought of men be then confirmed, </p>
<p> Nor the counsel of the mighty, </p>
<p> Nor shall the hope of those who hope be confirmed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when those things which were predicted have come to pass, </p>
<p> Then shall confusion fall upon all men, </p>
<p> And some of them shall fall in battle, </p>
<p> And some of them shall perish in anguish, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And some of them shall be destroyed by their own. Then the Most High peoples whom He has prepared before, </p>
<p> And they shall come and make war with the leaders that shall then be left. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass that whoever gets safe out of the war shall die in the earthquake, </p>
<p> And whoever gets safe out of the earthquake shall be burned by the fire, </p>
<p> And whoever gets safe out of the fire shall be destroyed by famine. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [And it shall come to pass that whoever of the victors and the vanquished gets safe out of and escapes all these things aforesaid will be delivered into the hands of My servant Messiah.] </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For all the earth shall devour its inhabitants. </p>
