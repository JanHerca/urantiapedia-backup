<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass when I had finished speaking the words of this prayer, that I sat there under a tree, that I might rest in the shade of the branches. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I wondered and was astonished, and pondered in my thoughts regarding the multitude of goodness which sinners who are upon the earth have rejected, and regarding the great torment which they have despised, though they knew that they should be tormented because of the sin they had committed. And when I was pondering on these things and the like, lo! the angel Ramiel who presides over true visions was sent to me, and he said unto me: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  ‘Why does your heart trouble you, Baruch, </p>
<p> and why does your thought disturb you? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For if owing to the report which you have only heard of judgment you are so moved, </p>
<p> What (wilt you be) when you shall see it manifestly with your eyes? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And if with the expectation wherewith you do expect the day of the Mighty One you are so overcome, </p>
<p> What (wilt you be) when you shall come to its advent? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And, if at the word of the announcement of the torment of those who have done foolishly you are so wholly distraught, </p>
<p> How much more when the event will reveal marvelous things? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And if you have heard tidings of the good and evil things which are then coming and are grieved, </p>
<p> What (wilt you be) when you shall behold what the majesty will reveal, Which shall convict these and cause those to rejoice.’ </p>
