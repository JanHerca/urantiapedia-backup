<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And He answered and said unto me: </p>
<p> ‘Hear, Baruch, this word, </p>
<p> And write in the remembrance of your heart all that you shall learn. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the earth shall then assuredly restore the dead, </p>
<p> [Which it now receives, in order to preserve them]. </p>
<p> It shall make no change in their form, </p>
<p> But as it has received, so shall it restore them, </p>
<p> And as I delivered them unto it, so also shall it raise them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For then it will be necessary to show the living that the dead have come to life again, and that those who had departed have returned (again). </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, when they have severally recognized those whom they now know, then judgment shall grow strong, and those things which before were spoken of shall come.’ </p>
