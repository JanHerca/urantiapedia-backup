<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, when He has brought low everything that is in the world, </p>
<p> And has sat down in peace for the age on the throne of His kingdom, </p>
<p> That joy shall then be revealed, </p>
<p> And rest shall appear. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And then healing shall descend in dew, </p>
<p> And disease shall withdraw, </p>
<p> And anxiety and anguish and lamentation pass from amongst men, </p>
<p> And gladness proceed through the whole earth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And no one shall again die untimely, </p>
<p> Nor shall any adversity suddenly befall. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And judgments, and abusive talk, and contentions, and revenges, </p>
<p> And blood, and passions, and envy, and hatred, </p>
<p> And whatsoever things are like these shall go into condemnation when they are removed. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For it is these very things which have filled this world with evils, </p>
<p> And on account of these the life of man has been greatly troubled. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And wild beasts shall come from the forest and minister unto men </p>
<p> And asps and dragons shall come forth from their holes to submit themselves to a little child. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And women shall no longer then have pain when they bear, </p>
<p> Nor shall they suffer torment when they yield the fruit of the womb. </p>
