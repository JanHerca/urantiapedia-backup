<p> <i>The Destiny of the Apostates and of the Proselytes</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I answered and said: ‘For whom and for how many shall these things be? or who will be worthy to live at that time? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For I will speak before you everything that I think, and I will ask of you regarding those things which I meditate. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For lo! I see many of Your people who have withdrawn from Your covenant, and cast from them the yoke of Your law. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But others again I have seen who have forsaken their vanity, and fled for refuge beneath Your wings. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What therefore will be to them? or how will the last time receive them? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Or perhaps the time of these will assuredly be weighed, and as the beam inclines will they be judged accordingly?’ </p>
