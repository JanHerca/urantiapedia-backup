<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now the angels did as he had commanded them, and when they had broken up the corners of the walls, a voice was heard from the interior of the temple, after the wall had fall saying: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  ‘Enter, you enemies, </p>
<p> And come, you adversaries; </p>
<p> For he who kept the house has forsaken (it).’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I, Baruch, departed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And it came to pass after these things that the army of the Chaldees entered and seized the house, and all that was around it. And they led the people away captive and slew some of them, and bound Zedekiah the king, and sent him to the king of Babylon. </p>
