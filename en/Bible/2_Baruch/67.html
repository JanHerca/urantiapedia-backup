<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the black eleventh waters which you have seen: this is the calamity which is now befalling Zion. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Do you think that there is no anguish to the angels in the presence of the Mighty One, </p>
<p> That Zion was so delivered up, </p>
<p> And that lo! the Gentiles boast in their hearts, </p>
<p> And assemble before their idols and say, </p>
<p> “She is trodden down who oftentimes trod down, </p>
<p> And she has been reduced to servitude who reduced (others)”? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Dost you think that in these things the Most High rejoices, </p>
<p> Or that His name is glorified? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [But how will it serve towards His righteous judgment?] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yet after these things shall the dispersed among the Gentiles be taken hold of by tribulation, </p>
<p> And in shame shall they dwell in every place. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Because so far as Zion is delivered up </p>
<p> And Jerusalem laid waste, </p>
<p> Shall idols prosper in the cities of the Gentiles, </p>
<p> And the vapor of the smoke of the incense of the righteousness which is by the law is extinguished in Zion, </p>
<p> And in the region of Zion in every place lo! there is the smoke of impiety. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But the king of Babylon will arise who has now destroyed Zion, </p>
<p> And he will boast over the people, </p>
<p> And he will speak great things in his heart in the presence of the Most High. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But he also shall fall at last. These are the black waters. </p>
