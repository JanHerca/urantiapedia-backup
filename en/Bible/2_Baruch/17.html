<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the Lord answered and said unto me: ‘With the Most High account is not taken of time nor of a few years. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For what did it profit Adam that he lived nine hundred and thirty years and transgressed that which he was commanded? Therefore the multitude of time that he lived did not profit him, but brought death and cut off the years of those who were born from him. wherein did Moses suffer loss in that he lived only one hundred and twenty years, and, inasmuch he was subject to Him who formed him, brought the law to the seed of Jacob, and lighted a lamp for the nation of Israel?’ </p>
