<p> <i>God's Reply to Baruch's Prayer. He will fulfill His Promise: Time needed for its Accomplishment: Things must be judged in the Light of their Consummation (22). Till all Souls are born the End cannot come (23).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass after these things that lo! the heavens were opened, and I saw, and power was given to me, and a voice was beard from on high, and it said unto me: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Baruch, Baruch, why are you troubled? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He who travels by a road but does not complete it, or who departs by sea but does not arrive at the port, can he be comforted? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Or he who promises to give a present to another, but does not fulfill it, is it not robbery? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Or he who sows the earth, but does not reap its fruit in its season, does he not lose everything? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Or he who plants a plant unless it grows till the time suitable to it, does he who planted it expect to receive fruit from it? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Or a woman who has conceived, if she bring forth untimely, does she not assuredly slay her infant? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Or he who builds a house, if he does not roof it and complete it, can it be called a house? Tell Me that first. </p>
