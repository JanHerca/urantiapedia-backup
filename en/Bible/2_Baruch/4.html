<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the Lord said unto me: </p>
<p> ‘This city shall be delivered up for a time, </p>
<p> And the people shall be chastened during a time, </p>
<p> And the world will not be given over to oblivion. </p>
<p> <i>The heavenly Jerusalem</i> </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [Dost you think that this is that city of which I said: “On the palms of My hands have I graven you”? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This building now built in your midst is not that which is revealed with Me, that which prepared beforehand here from the time when I took counsel to make Paradise, and showed Adam before he sinned, but when he transgressed the commandment it was removed from him, as also Paradise. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And after these things I showed it to My servant Abraham by night among the portions of the victims. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And again also I showed it to Moses on Mount Sinai when I showed to the likeness of the tabernacle and all its vessels. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And now, behold, it is preserved with Me, as Paradise. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Go, therefore, and do as I command you.’] </p>
