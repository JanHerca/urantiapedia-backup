<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ‘Nevertheless, whoever understands shall then be wise. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the measure and reckoning of that time are two parts a week of seven weeks.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I answered and said: ‘It is good for a man to come and behold, but it is better that he should not come lest he fall. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [But I will say this also: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Will he who is incorruptible despise those things which are corruptible, and whatever befalls in the case of those things which are corruptible, so that he might look only to those things which are not corruptible?] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But if; O Lord, those things shall assuredly come to pass which you have foretold to me, so do you show this also unto me if indeed I have found grace in Your sight. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Is it in one place or in one of the parts of the earth that those things are come to pass, or will the whole earth experience (them) ?’ </p>
