<p> <i>The Vision of the Forest, the Vine, the Fountain and the Cedar</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision in the night. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And lo! a forest of trees planted on the plain, and lofty and rugged rocky mountains surrounded it, and that forest occupied much space. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And lo! over against it arose a vine, and from under it there went forth a fountain peacefully. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now that fountain came to the forest and was (stirred) into great waves, and those waves submerged that forest, and suddenly they rooted out the greater part of that forest, and overthrew all the mountains which were round about it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the height of the forest began to be made low, and the top of the mountains was made low and that fountain prevailed greatly, so that it left nothing of that great forest save one cedar only. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Also when it had cast it down and had destroyed and rooted out the greater part of that forest, so that nothing was left of it, nor could its place be recognized, then that vine began to come with the fountain in peace and great tranquility, and it came to a place which was not far from that cedar, and they brought the cedar which had been cast down to it. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I beheld and lo! that vine opened its mouth and spoke and said to that cedar: Art you not that cedar which was left of the forest of wickedness, and by whose means wickedness persisted, and was wrought all those years, and goodness never. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And you kept conquering that which was not yours, and to that which was your you did never show compassion, and you did keep extending your power over those who were far from you, and those who drew near you, you did hold fast in the toils of your wickedness, and you did uplift thyself always as one that could not be rooted out! </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But now your time has sped and your hour is come. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Do you also therefore depart, O cedar, after the forest, which departed before you, and become dust with it, and let your ashes be mingled together. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And now recline in anguish and rest in torment till your last time come, in which you will come again, and be tormented still more. </p>
