<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after these (waters) you did see bright waters: this is the fount of Abraham, also his generations and advent of his son, and of his son's son, and of those like them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Because at that time the unwritten law was named amongst them, </p>
<p> And the works of the commandments were then fulfilled, </p>
<p> And belief in the coming judgment was then generated, </p>
<p> And hope of the world that was to be renewed was then built up, </p>
<p> And the promise of the life that should come hereafter was implanted. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These are the bright waters, which you have seen. </p>
