<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the bright tenth waters which you have seen: this is the purity of the generations of Josiah king of Judah, who was the only one at the time who submitted himself to the Mighty One with all his heart and with all his soul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he cleansed the land from idols, and hallowed all the vessels which had been polluted, and restored the offerings to the altar, and raised the horn of the holy, and exalted the righteous, and honored all that were wise in understanding, and brought back the priests to their ministry, and destroyed and removed the magicians and enchanters and necromancers from the land. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And not only did he slay the impious that were living, but they also took from the sepulchers the bones of the dead and burned them with fire. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [And the festivals and the Sabbaths he established in their sanctity], and their polluted ones he burnt in the fire, and the lying prophets which deceived the people, these also he burnt in the fire, and the people who listened to them when they were living, he cast them into the brook Kidron, and heaped stones upon them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he was zealous with zeal for the Mighty One with all his soul, and he alone was firm in the law at that time, so that he left none that was uncircumcised, or that wrought impiety in all the land, all the days of his life. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore he shall receive an eternal reward, and he shall be glorified with the Mighty One beyond many at a later time. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For on his account and on account of those who are like him were the honorable glories, of which you were told before, created and prepared. These arc the bright waters which you have seen. </p>
