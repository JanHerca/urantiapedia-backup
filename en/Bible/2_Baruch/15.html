<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the Lord answered and said unto me: ‘You are rightly astonished regarding the departure of man, but you have not judged well regarding the evils which befall those who sin. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And as regards what you have said, that the righteous are carried off and the impious are prospered, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And as regards what you have said: “Man knows not Your judgment ”—On this account hear, and I will speak to you, and hearken, and I will cause you to hear My words. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Man would not rightly have understood My judgment, unless he had accepted the law, and I had instructed him in understanding. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But now, because he transgressed wittingly, yea, just on this ground that he knows (about it), he shall be tormented. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And as regards what you did say touching the righteous, that on account of them has this world come, so also again shall that, which is to come, come on their account. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For this world is to them a strife and a labor with much trouble; and that accordingly which is to come, a crown with great glory.’ </p>
