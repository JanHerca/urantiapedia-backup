<p> <i>Baruch's Hymn on the Unsearchableness of God's Ways and on His Mercies through which the Faithful shall attain to a blessed Consummation</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I answered and said: </p>
<p> ‘Who can understand, O Lord, Your goodness? </p>
<p> For it is incomprehensible. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Or who can search into your compassions, </p>
<p> Which are infinite? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Or who can comprehend Your intelligence? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Or who is able to recount the thoughts of Your mind? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Or who of those who are born can hope to come to those things, </p>
<p> Unless he is one to whom you are merciful and gracious? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Because, if assuredly you did not have compassion on man, </p>
<p> Those who are under Your right hand, </p>
<p> They could not come to those things, </p>
<p> But those who are in the numbers named can be called. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But if, indeed, we who exist know wherefore we have come, </p>
<p> And submit ourselves to Him who brought us out of Egypt, </p>
<p> We shall come again and remember those things which have passed, </p>
<p> And shall rejoice regarding that which has been. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But if now we know not wherefore we have come, </p>
<p> And recognize not the principate of Him who brought us up out of Egypt, We shall come again and seek after those things which have been now, </p>
<p> And be grieved with pain because of those things which have befallen.’ </p>
