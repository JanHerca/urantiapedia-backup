<p> <i>The coming Judgment</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ‘For behold! the days come and the books shall be opened in which are written the sins of all those who have sinned, and again also the treasuries in which the righteousness of all those who have been righteous in creation is gathered. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For it shall come to pass at that time that you shall see—and the many that are with you—the long-suffering of the Most High, which has been throughout all generations, who has been long-suffering towards all who are born, (alike) those who sin and (those who) are righteous.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I answered and said: ‘But, behold! O Lord, no one knows the number of those things which have passed nor yet of those things which are to come. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For I know indeed that which has befallen us, but what will happen to our enemies I know not, and when you will visit Your works.’ </p>
