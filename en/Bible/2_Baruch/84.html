<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Behold! I have therefore made known unto you (these things) whilst I live: for I have said (it) that you should learn the things that are excellent; for the Mighty One hath commanded me to instruct you: and I will set before you some of the commandments of His judgment before I die. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Remember that formerly Moses assuredly called heaven and earth to witness against you and said: ‘If you transgress the law you shall be dispersed, but if you keep it you shall be kept.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And other things also he used to say unto you when you the twelve tribes were together in the desert. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And after his death you cast them away from you: on this account there came upon you what had been predicted. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And now Moses used to tell you before they befell you, and lo! they have befallen you: for you have forsaken the law. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Lo! I also say unto you after you have suffered, that if you obey those things which have been said unto you, you will receive from the Mighty One whatever has been laid up and reserved for you. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Moreover, let this epistle be for a testimony between me and you, that you may remember the commandments of the Mighty One, and that also there may be to me a defense in the presence of Him who sent me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And remember you the law and Zion, and the holy land and your brethren, and the covenant of your fathers, and forget not the festivals and the Sabbaths. And deliver this epistle and the traditions of the law to your sons after you, as also your fathers delivered (them) to you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And at all times make request perseveringly and pray diligently with your whole heart that the Mighty One may be reconciled to you, and that He may not reckon the multitude of your sins, but remember the rectitude of your fathers. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For if He judge us not according to the multitude of His mercies, woe unto all us who are born. </p>
