<p> <i>THE EPISTLE OF BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH WHICH HE WROTE TO THE NINE AND A HALF TRIBES</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  These are the words of that epistle which Baruch the son of Neriah sent to the nine and a half tribes, which were across the river Euphrates, in which these things were written. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus says Baruch the son of Neriah to the brethren carried into captivity: ‘Mercy and peace.’ I bear in mind, my brethren, the love of Him who created us, who loved us from of old, and never hated us, but above all educated us. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And truly I know that behold all we the twelve tribes are bound by one bond, inasmuch as we are born from one father. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wherefore I have been the more careful to leave you the words of this epistle before I die, that you may be comforted regarding the evils which have come upon you, and that you may be grieved also regarding the evil that has befallen your brethren; and again, also, that you may justify His judgment which </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He has decreed against you that you should be carried away captive—for what you have suffered is disproportioned to what you have done—in order that, at the last times, you may be found worthy of your fathers. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore, if you consider that ye have now suffered those things for your good, that you may not finally be condemned and tormented, then you will receive eternal hope; if above all you destroy from your heart vain error, on account of which you departed hence. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For if you so do these things, He will continually remember you, He who always promised on our behalf to those who were more excellent than we, that He will never forget or forsake us, but with much mercy will gather together again those who were dispersed. </p>
