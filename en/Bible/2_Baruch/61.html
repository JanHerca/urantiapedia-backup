<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the bright sixth waters which thru did see, this is the time in which David and Solomon were born. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And there was at that time the building of Zion, </p>
<p> And the dedication of the sanctuary, </p>
<p> And the shedding of much blood of the nations that sinned then, </p>
<p> And many offerings which were offered then in the dedication of the sanctuary. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And peace and tranquility existed at that time, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And wisdom was heard in the assembly: </p>
<p> And the riches of understanding were magnified in the congregations, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the holy festivals were fulfilled in blessedness and in much joy. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the judgment of the rulers was then seen to be without guile, </p>
<p> And the righteousness of the precepts of the Mighty One was accomplished with truth. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the land [which] was then beloved by the Lord, </p>
<p> And because its inhabitants sinned not, it was glorified beyond all lands, And the city Zion ruled then over all lands and regions. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  These are the bright waters which you have seen. </p>
