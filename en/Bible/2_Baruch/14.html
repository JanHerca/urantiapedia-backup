<p> <i>The Righteousness of the Righteous has profited neither them nor their City; God's Judgments are incomprehensible; the World was made for the Righteous, yet they pass and the World remains (14). Answer—Man knows God's Judgments and has sinned willingly. This World is a Weariness to the Righteous but the next is theirs (15), to be won through Character whether a Man's Time here be long or short (16—17). Final Weal or Woe—the supreme Question (18—19).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  [And I answered and said: ‘Lo! you have shown me the method of the times, and that which shall be after these things, and you have said unto me, that the retribution, which has been spoken of by you, shall come upon the nations.] [OXY: And I answered and said: ‘Behold, you have shown me the methods of the times, and that which shall be. And you have said unto me that the retribution which was spoken of by you shall be endured by the nations.] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [And now I know that those who have sinned are many, and they have lived in prosperity,’ and departed from the world, but the few nations will be left in those times, to whom those words shall he said which you did say.] [OXY: And now I know that those who have sinned are many, and they have lived . . . , and departed from the world, but that few nations will be left in those times to whom . . . the words (which) you did say.] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [For what advantage is there in this, or what (evil), worse than what we have seen befall us, are we to expect to see?] [OXY: And what advantage (is there) in this or what worse than (these?)] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But again I will speak in Your presence: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What have they profited who had knowledge before you and have not walked in vanity as the rest of the nations, and have not said to the dead: “Give us life,” but always feared you, and have not left Your ways? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And lo! they have been carried off, nor on their account have you had mercy on Zion. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if others did evil, it was due to Zion that on account of the works of those who wrought good works she should be forgiven, and should not be overwhelmed on account of the works of those who wrought unrighteousness. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But who, O LORD, my Lord, will comprehend Your judgment, </p>
<p> Or who will search out the profoundness of Your way? </p>
<p> Or who will think out the weight of Your path? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Or who will be able to think out Your incomprehensible counsel? </p>
<p> Or who of those that are born has ever found </p>
<p> The beginning or end of Your wisdom? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For we have all been made like a breath. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For as the breath ascends involuntarily, and again dies, so it is with the nature of men, who depart not according to their own will, and know not what will befall them in the end. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with you a store of works preserved in treasuries. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  On this account also these without fear leave this world, and trusting with joy they hope to receive the world which you have promised them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But as for us—woe to us, who also are now shamefully entreated, and at that time look forward (only) to evils. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But you know accurately what you have done by means of Your servants; for we are not able to understand that which is good as you art, our Creator. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But again I will speak in Your presence, O LORD, my Lord. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, you did devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before you. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And you did say that you wouldst make for Your world man as the administrator of Your works, that it might be known that he was by no means made on account of the world, but the world on account of him. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And now I see that as for the world which was made on account of us, lo! it abides; but we, on account of whom it was made, depart.’ </p>
