<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For the last waters which you have seen which were darker than all that were before them, those which were after the twelfth number, which were collected together, belong to the whole world. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the Most High made division from the beginning, because He alone knows what will befall. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For as to the enormities and the impieties which should be wrought before Him, He foresaw six kinds of them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And of the good works of the righteous which should be accomplished before Him, He foresaw six kinds of them, beyond those which He should work at the consummation of the age. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  On his account there were not black waters with black, nor bright with bright; for it is the consummation. </p>
