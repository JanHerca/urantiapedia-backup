<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I answered and said: ‘Not so, O LORD, my Lord.’ </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He answered and said unto me: ‘Why therefore are you troubled about that which you know not, and why are you ill at ease about things in which you are ignorant? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For as you have not forgotten the people who now are and those who have passed away, so I remember those who are appointed to come. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because when Adam sinned and death was decreed against those who should be born, then the multitude of those who should be born was numbered, and for that number a place was prepared where the living might dwell and the dead might be guarded. Before therefore the number aforesaid is fulfilled, the creature will not live again [for My spirit is the creator of life], and Sheol will receive the dead. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And again it is given to you to hear what things are to come after these times. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For truly My redemption has drawn nigh, and is not far distant as aforetime.’ </p>
