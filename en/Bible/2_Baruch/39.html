<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And He answered and said unto me: ‘Baruch, this is the interpretation of the vision which you have seen. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As you have seen the great forest which lofty and rugged mountains surrounded, this is the word. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Behold! the days come, and this kingdom will be destroyed which once destroyed Zion, and it will be subjected to that which comes after it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Moreover, that also again after a time will be destroyed, and another, a third, will arise, and that also will have dominion for its time, and will be destroyed. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And after these things a fourth kingdom will arise, whose power will be harsh and evil far beyond those which were before it, and it will rule many times as the forests on the plain, and it will hold fast for times, and will exalt itself more than the cedars of Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And by it the truth will be hidden, and all those who are polluted with iniquity will flee to it, as evil beasts flee and creep into the forest. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And it will come to pass when the time of its consummation that it should fall has approached, then the principate of My Messiah will be revealed, which is like the fountain and the vine, and when it is revealed it will root out the multitude of its host. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And as touching that which you have seen, the lofty cedar, which was left of that forest, and the fact, that the vine spoke those words with it which you did hear, this is the word.’ </p>
