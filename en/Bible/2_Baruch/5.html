<p> <i>Baruch's Complaint and God's Reassurance</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I answered and said: </p>
<p> ‘So then I am destined to grieve for Zion, </p>
<p> For your enemies will come to this place and pollute Your sanctuary, </p>
<p> And lead your inheritance into captivity, </p>
<p> And make themselves masters of those whom you have loved, </p>
<p> And they will depart again to the place of their idols, </p>
<p> And will boast before them: </p>
<p> And what will you do for Your great name?’ </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the Lord said unto me: </p>
<p> ‘My name and My glory are unto all eternity; </p>
<p> And My judgment shall maintain its right in its own time. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And you shall see with your eyes </p>
<p> That the enemy will not overthrow Zion, </p>
<p> Nor shall they burn Jerusalem, </p>
<p> But be the ministers of the Judge for the time. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But do you go and do whatsoever I have said unto you.’ </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I went and took Jeremiah, and Adu, and Seriah, and Jabish, and Gedaliah, and all the honorable men of the people, and I led them to the valley of Kidron, and I narrated to them all that had been said to me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they lifted up their voice, and they all wept. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And we sat there and fasted until the evening. </p>
