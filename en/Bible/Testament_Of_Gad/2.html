<p> <i>Gad exhorts his listeners against hatred showing how it has brought him into so much trouble. Verses 8-11 are memorable.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND now, my children, I exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love one another in deed, and in word, and in the inclination of the soul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For in the presence of my father I spake peaceably to Joseph; and when I had gone out, the spirit of hatred darkened my mind, and stirred up my soul to slay him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Love ye one another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee, speak peaceably to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent and confess, forgive him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But if he deny it, do not get into a passion with him, lest catching the poison from thee he take to swearing and so thou sin doubly. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let not another man hear thy secrets when engaged in legal strife, lest he come to hate thee and become thy enemy, and commit a great sin against thee; for ofttimes he addresseth thee guilefully or busieth himself about thee with wicked intent. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And though he deny it and yet have a sense of shame when reproved, give over reproving him. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For be who denieth may repent so as not again to wrong thee; yea, he may also honour thee, and fear and be at peace with thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And if he be shameless and persist in his wrong-doing, even so forgive him from the heart, and leave to God the avenging. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  If a man prospereth more than you, do not be vexed, but pray also for him, that he may have perfect prosperity. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  for so it is expedient for you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And if he be further exalted, be not envious of him, remembering that all flesh shall die; and offer praise to God, who giveth things good and profitable to all men. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Seek out the judgments of the Lord, and thy mind will rest and be at peace. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And though a man become rich by evil means, even as Esau, the brother of my father, be not jealous; but wait for the end of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For if he taketh away from a man wealth gotten by evil means He forgiveth him if he repent, but the unrepentant is reserved for eternal punishment. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For the poor man, if free from envy he pleaseth the Lord in all things, is blessed beyond all men, because he hath not the travail of vain men. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Put away, therefore, jealousy from your souls, and love one another with uprightness of heart. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Do ye also therefore tell these things to your children, that they honour Judah and Levi, for from them shall the Lord raise up salvation to Israel. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For I know that at the last your children shall depart from Him, and shall walk in O wickedness, and affliction and corruption before the Lord. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And when he had rested for a little while, he said again; My children, obey your father, and bury me near to my fathers. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And he drew up his feet, and fell asleep in peace. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And after five years they carried him up to Hebron, and laid him with his fathers. </p>
