<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, | and of their righteous seed </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  thou who hast made heaven and earth | with all their order; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  who hast shackled the sea by thy word of command, | who hast confined the deep | and sealed it with thy terrible and glorious name; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  at whom all things shudder, | and tremble before thy power, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for thy glorious splendor cannot be borne, | and the wrath of thy threat to sinners is irresistible; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  yet immeasurable and unsearchable is thy promised mercy, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  for thou art the Lord Most High, | of great compassion, long-suffering, and very merciful, | and repentest over the evils of men. | Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness | hast promised repentance and forgiveness | to those who have sinned against thee; | and in the multitude of thy mercies | thou hast appointed repentance for sinners, | that they may be saved. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore thou, O Lord, God of the righteous, | hast not appointed repentance for the righteous, | for Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, who did not sin against thee, | but thou hast appointed repentance for me, who am a sinner. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the sins I have committed are more in number | than the sand of the sea; | my transgressions are multiplied, O Lord, they are multiplied! | I am unworthy to look up and see the height of heaven | because of the multitude of my iniquities. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I am weighted down with many an iron fetter, | so that I am rejected because of my sins, | and I have no relief; | for I have provoked thy wrath | and have done what is evil in thy sight, | setting up abominations and multiplying offenses. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And now I bend the knee of my heart, | beseeching thee for thy kindness. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, | and I know my transgressions. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I earnestly beseech thee, | forgive me, O Lord, forgive me! | Do not destroy me with my transgressions! | Do not be angry with me for ever or lay up evil for me; | do not condemn me to the depths of the earth. | For thou, O Lord, art the God of those who repent, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and in me thou wilt manifest thy goodness; | for, unworthy as I am, thou wilt save me in thy great mercy, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and I will praise thee continually all the days of my life. | For all the host of heaven sings thy praise, | and thine is the glory for ever. Amen. </p>
