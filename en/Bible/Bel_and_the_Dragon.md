## Description

“Bel and the Dragon”

_From King James Version_

The narrative of “Bel and the Dragon” is incorporated as chapter 14 of the extended Book of Daniel. The original Septuagint text in Greek survives in a single manuscript, Codex Chisianus, while the standard text is due to Theodotion, the 2nd-century AD revisor.

This chapter, along with chapter 13, is considered deuterocanonical: it was unknown to early Rabbinic Judaism, and while it is considered non-canonical by most Protestants, it is canonical to both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, and is found in the Apocrypha section of 80 Protestant Bibles.
