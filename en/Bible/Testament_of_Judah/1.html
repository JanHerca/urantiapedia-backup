<p> <i>Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah. He is the giant, athlete, warrior; he recounts heroic deeds. He runs so fast that he can outstrip a hind.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE copy of the words of Judah, what things he spake to his sons before he died. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They gathered themselves together, therefore, and came to him, and he said to them: Hearken, my children, to Judah your father. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I was the fourth son born to my father Jacob; and Leah my mother named me Judah, saying, I give thanks to the Lord, because He hath given me a fourth son also. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I was swift in my youth, and obedient to my father in everything. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I honoured my mother and my mother's sister. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when I became a man, that my father blessed me, saying, Thou shalt be a king, prospering in all things. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the Lord showed me favour in all my works both in the field and in the house. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I know that I raced a hind, and caught it, and prepared the meat for my father, and he did eat. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the roes I used to master in the chase, and overtake all that was in the plains. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A wild mare I overtook, and caught it and tamed it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I slew a lion and plucked a kid out of its mouth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I took a bear by its paw and hurled it down the cliff, and it was crushed. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I outran the wild boar, and seizing it as I ran, I tore it in sunder. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  A leopard in Hebron leaped upon my dog, and I caught it by the tail, and hurled it on the rocks, and it was broken in twain </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I found a wild ox feeding in the fields, and seizing it by the horns, and whirling it round and stunning it, I cast it from me and slew it. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And when the two kings of the Canaanites came sheathed, in armour against our flocks, and much people with them, single handed I rushed upon the king of Hazor, and smote him on the greives and dragged him down, and so I slew him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the other, the king of Tappuah, as he sat upon his horse, I slew, and so I scattered all his people. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Achor, the king, a man of giant stature, I found, hurling javelins before and behind as he sat on horseback, and I took up a stone of sixty pounds weight, and hurled it and smote his horse, and killed it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I fought with this other for two hours; and I clave his shield in twain, and I chopped off his feet, and killed him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And as I was stripping off his breastplate, behold nine men his companions began to fight with me, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And I wound my garment on my hand; and I slung stones at them, and killed four of them, and the rest fled. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Jacob my father slew Beelesath, king of all the kings, a giant in strength, twelve cubits high. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And fear fell upon them, and they ceased warring against us. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Therefore my father was free from anxiety in the wars when I was with my brethren. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For he saw in a vision concerning me that an angel of might followed me everywhere, that I should not be overcome. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And in the south there came upon us a greater war than that in Shechem; and I joined in battle array with my brethren, and pursued a thousand men, and slew of them two hundred men and four kings. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And I went up upon the wall, and I slew four mighty men. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And so we captured Hazor, and took all the spoil. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And the next day we departed to Aretan, a city strong and walled and inaccessible, threatening us with death. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  But I and Gad approached on the east side of the city, and Reuben and Levi on the west. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And they that were upon the wall, thinking that we were alone, were drawn down against us. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And so my brothers secretly climbed up the wall on both sides by stakes, and entered the city, while the men knew it not. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And we took it with the edge of the sword. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And as for those who had taken refuge in the tower, we set fire to the tower and took both it and, them. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And as we were departing the men of Tappuah seized our spoil, and seeing this we fought with them. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And we slew them. all and recovered our spoil. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And when I was at the waters of Kozeba, the men of Jobel came against us to battle. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And we fought with them and routed them; and their allies from Shiloh we slew, and we did not leave them power to come in against us. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And the men of Makir came upon us the fifth day, to seize our spoil; and we attacked them and overcame them in fierce battle: for there was a host of mighty men amongst them, and we slew them before they had gone up the ascent. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And when we came to their city their women rolled upon us stones from the brow of the hill on which the city stood. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And I and Simeon had ourselves behind the town, and seized upon the heights, and destroyed this city also. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  And the next day it was told us that the king of the city of Gaash with. a mighty host was coming against us. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  I, therefore, and Dan feigned ourselves to be Amorites, and as allies went into their city. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And in the depth of night our brethren came and we opened to them the gates; and we destroyed all the men and their substance, and we took for a prey all that was theirs, and their three walls we cast down. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  And we drew near to Thamna, where was all the substance of the hostile kings. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  Then being insulted by them, I was therefore wroth, and rushed against them to the summit; and they kept slinging against me stones and darts. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  And had not Dan my brother aided me, they would have slain me. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  We came upon them, therefore, with wrath, and they all fled; and passing by another way, they fought my father, and he made peace with them. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  And we did to them no hurt, and they became tributary to us, and we restored to them their spoil. </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  And I built Thamna, and my father built Pabael. </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  I was twenty years old when this war befell. And the Canaanites feared me and my brethren. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  And I had much cattle, and I had for chief herdsman Iram the Adullamite. </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  And when I went to him I saw Parsaba, king of Adullam; and he spake unto us, and he made us a feast; and when I was heated he gave me his daughter Bathshua to wife. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  She bare me Er, and Onan and Shelah; and two of them the Lord smote: for Shelah lived, and his children are ye. </p>
