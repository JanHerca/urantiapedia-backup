<p> <i>Judah describes some archeological findings, a city with walls of Iron and gates of brass. He has an encounter with an adventuress.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND eighteen years my father abode in peace with his brother Esau, and his sons with us, after that we came from Mesopotamia, from Laban. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when eighteen years were fulfilled, in the fortieth year of my life, Esau, the brother of my father, came upon us with a mighty and strong people. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Jacob smote Esau with an arrow, and he was taken up wounded on Mount Seir, and as he went he died at Anoniram. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And we pursued after the sons of Esau. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now they had a city with walls of iron and gates of brass; and we could not enter into it, and we encamped around, and besieged it. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when they opened not to us in twenty days, I set up a ladder in the sight of all and with my shield upon my head I went up, sustaining the assault of stones, upwards of three talents weight; and I slew four of their mighty men. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Reuben and Gad slew six others. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then they asked from us terms of peace; and having taken counsel with our father, we received them as tributaries. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they gave us five hundred cors of wheat, five hundred baths of oil, five hundred measures of wine, until the famine, when we went down into Egypt. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And after these things my son Er took to wife Tamar, from Mesopotamia, a daughter of Aram. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Now Er was wicked, and he was in need concerning Tamar, because she was not of the land of Canaan. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And on the third night an angel of the Lord smote him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he had not known her according to the evil craftiness of his mother, for he did not wish to have children by her. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In the days of the wedding feast I gave Onan to her in marriage; and he also in wickedness knew her not, though he spent with her a year. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And when I threatened him he went in unto her, but he spilled the seed on the ground, according to the command of his mother, and he also died through wickedness. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I wished to give Shelah also to her, but his mother did not permit it; for she wrought evil against Tamar, because she was not the daughters of Canaan, as she also herself was. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I knew that the race of the Canaanites was wicked, but the impulse of youth blinded my mind. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And when I saw her pouring out wine, owing to the intoxication of wine I was deceived, and took her although my father had not counselled it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And while I was away she went and took for Shelah a wife from Canaan. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And when I knew what she had done, I cursed her in the anguish of my soul. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And she also died through her wickedness together with her sons. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And after these things, while Tamar was a widow, she heard after two years that I was going up, to shear my sheep, and adorned herself in bridal array, and sat in the city Enaim by the gate. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For it was a law of the Amorites, that she who was about to marry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Therefore being drunk with wine, I did not recognize her; and her beauty deceived me, through the fashion of her adorning. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And I turned aside to her, and said: Let me go in unto thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And she said: What wilt thou give me? And I gave her my staff, and my girdle, and the diadem of my kingdom in pledge. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And I went in unto her, and she conceived. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And not knowing what I had done, I wished to slay her; but she privily sent my pledges, and put me to shame. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And when I called her, I heard also the secret words which I spoke when lying with her in my drunkenness; and I could not slay her, because it was from the Lord. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For I said, Lest haply she did it in subtlety, having received the pledge from another woman. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  But I came not again near her while I lived, because I had done this abomination in all Israel. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Moreover, they who were in the city said there was no harlot in the gate, because she came from another place, and sat for a while in the gate. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And I thought that no one knew that I had gone in to her. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And after this we came into Egypt to Joseph, because of the famine. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And I was forty and six years old, and seventy and three years lived I in Egypt. </p>
