<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle [fire on] mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
