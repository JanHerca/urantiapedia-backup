<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When I spoke thus to them, Ehiphaz became angry and said to the other friends “For what purpose is it that we have come here with our hosts to comfort him? Behold, he upbraids us. Therefore let us return to our countries. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  This man sits here in misery worm-eaten amidst an unbearable state of putrefaction, and yet he challenges its saving : ‘Kingdoms shall perish and their rulers, but my Kingdom, says he, shall last forever’”. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Eliphaz, then, rose in great commotion, and, turning away from them in great fury, said: “I go hence. We have indeed come to comfort him, but he declares war to us in view of our armies”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But then Baldad seized him by the hand and said : “Not thus ought one to speak to an afflicted man, and especially to one stricken down with so many plagues. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, we, being in good health, dared not approach him on account of the offensive odor, except with the help of plenty of fragrant aroma. But thou, Eliphaz. art forgetful of all this. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let me speak plainly. Let us be magnanimous and learn what is the cause Must he in remembering his former days of happiness not become mad in his mind </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Who should not be altogether perplexed seeing himself thus lapse into misfortune and plagues. But let me step near him that I may find by what cause is he thus” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Baldad rose and approached me saying: “Art thou Job” and he said : “Is thy heart still in good keeping” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I said: “I did not hold fast to the earthly things, since the earth with all that inhabit it is unstable. But my heart holds fast to the heaven, because there is no trouble in heaven”. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Baldad rejoined and said : “We know that the earth is unstable, for it changes according to season. At times it is in a state of peace, and at times it is in a state of war. But of the heaven we hear that it is perfectly steady. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But art thou truly in a state of calmness Therefore let me ask and speak, and when thou answerest me to my first word, I shall have a second question to ask, and if again thou answerest in well-set words, it will be manifest that thy heart has not been unbalanced”. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I said : “Upon what dost thou set thy hope” And I said: “Upon the living God”. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he said to me : “Who deprived thee of all thou didst possess And who inflicted thee with these plagues” And I said: “God”. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he said: “If thou still placest thy hope upon God, how can He do wrong in judgment, having brought upon thee these plagues and misfortunes, and having taken from thee all thy possessions </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And since He has taken these, it is clear that He has given thee nothing. No king will disgrace his soldier who has served him well as body-guard” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  [And I answered saying] : “Who understands the depths of the Lord and of His wisdom to be able to accuse God of injustice” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  [And Baldad said] : “Answer me, o Job, to this. Again I say to thee : ‘If thou art in a state of calm reason, teach me if thou hast wisdom: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Why do we see the sun rise in the East and set in the West And again when rising in the morning we find him rise in the East Tell me thy- thought about this” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then said I: “Why shall I betray (babble forth) the mighty mysteries of God And should my mouth stumble in revealing things belonging to the Master Never! </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Who are we that we should pry into matters concerning the upper world while we are only of flesh, nay, earth and ashes! </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  In order that you know that my heart is sound, hear what I ask you: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Through the stomach cometh food, and water you drink through the mouth, and then it flows through the same throat, and when the two go down to become excrement, they again part; who effects this separation”. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Baldad said: “I do not know”. And I rejoined and said to him : “If thou dost not understand even the exits of the body, how canst thou understand the celestial circuits” </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Then Sophar rejoined and said : “We do not inquire after our own affairs, but we desire to know whether thou art in a sound state, and behold, we see that thy reason has not been shaken. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  What now dost thou wish that we should do for thee Behold, we have come here and brought the physicians of three kings, and if thou wishest, thou mayest he cured by them”. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But I answered and said : “My cure and my restoration cometh from God, the Maker of physicians”. </p>
