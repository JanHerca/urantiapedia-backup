<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After these three had finished singing hymns. did I Nahor (Neros) brother of Job sit down next to him, as he lay down. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I heard the marvelous (great) things of the three daughters of my brother, one always succeeding the other amidst awful silence. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I wrote down this book containing the hymns except the hymns and signs of the [holy] Word, for these were the great things of God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Job lay down from sickness on his couch, yet without pain and suffering, because his pain did not take strong hold of him on account of, the charm of the girdle which he had wound around himself. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But after three days Job saw the holy angels come for his soul, and instantly he rose and took the cithara and gave it to his daughter Day (Yemima). </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And to Kassia he gave a censer (with perfume = Kassia), and to Amalthea’s horn (= music) he gave a timbrel in order that they might bless the holy angels who came for his soul. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And they took these, and sang, and played on the psaltery and praised and glorified God in the holy dialect. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And after this he came He who sitteth upon the great chariot and kissed Job, while his three daughters looked on, but the others saw it not. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And He took the soul of Job and He soared upward, taking her (the soul) by the arm and carrying her upon the chariot, and He went towards the East. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  His body, however, was brought to the grave while the three daughters marched ahead, having put on their girdles and singing hymns in praise of God. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then held Nahor (Nereos) his brother and his seven sons, with the rest of the people and the poor, the orphans and the feeble ones, a great mourning over him, saying: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  “Woe unto us, for today has been taken from us the strength of the feeble, the light of the blind, the father of the orphans; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The receiver of strangers has been taken off the leader of the erring, the cover of the naked, the shield of the widows. Who would not mourn for the man of God!” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And as they were mourning in this and in that form, they would not suffer him to be put into the grave. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  After three days, however, he was finally put into the grave, like one in sweet slumber, and he received the name of the good (beautiful) who will remain renowned throughout all generations of the world. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He left seven sons and three daughters, and there were no daughters found on earth as fair as the daughters of Job. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The name of Job was formerly Jobab, and he was called Job by the Lord. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He had lived before his plague eighty five years, and after the plague he took the double share of all; hence also his year’s he doubled, which is 170 years. Thus he lived altogether 255 years. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And, he saw sons of his sons unto the fourth generation. It is written that he will rise up with those whom the Lord will reawaken. To our Lord by glory. Amen. </p>
