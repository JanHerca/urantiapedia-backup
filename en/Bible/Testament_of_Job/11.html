<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But I being desirous to take up again my work of benevolence for the poor, asked them saying: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Give me each a lamb for the clothing of the poor in their state of nakedness, and four drachmas (coins) of silver or gold” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then the Lord blessed all that was left to me, and after a few days I became rich again in merchandise, in flocks and all things which I had lost, and I received all in double number again. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then I also took as wife your mother and became the father of you ten in place of the ten children that had died. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And now, my children, let me admonish you: “Behold I die. You will take my place. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Only do not forsake the Lord. Be charitable towards the poor; Do not disregard the feeble. Take not unto yourselves wives from strangers. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Behold, my children, I shall divide among you what I possess, so that each may have control over his own and have full power to do good with his share”. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And after he had spoken thus, he brought all his goods and divided them among his seven sons, but he gave nothing of his goods to his daughters. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then they said to their father: “Our lord and father! Are we not also thy children Why, then, dost thou not also give us a share of thy possessions” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then said Job to his daughters : “Do not become angry my daughters. I have not forgotten you. Behold, I have preserved for you a possession better than that which your brothers have taken”. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he called his daughter whose name was Day (Yemima) and said to her: “Take this double ring used as a key and go to the treasure-house and bring me the golden casket, that I may give you your possession”. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And she went and brought it to him, and he opened it and took out three-stringed girdles about the appearance of which no man can speak. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For they were not earthly work, but celestial sparks of light flashed through them like the rays of the sun. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he gave one string to each of His daughters and said: “Put these as girdles around you in order that all the days of your life they may encircle you and endow you with every thing good”. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the other daughter whose name was Kassiah said: “Is this the possession of which thou sayest it is better than that of our brothers What now Can we live on this” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And their father said to them: “Not only have you here sufficient to live on, but these bring you into a better world to live in, in the heavens. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Or do you not know my children, the value of these things here Hear then! When the Lord had deemed me worthy to have compassion on me and to take off my body the plagues and the worms, He called me and handed to me these three strings. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And He said to me: ‘Rise and gird up thy loins like a man I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me'. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I took them and girt them around my loins, and immediately did the worms leave my body, and likewise did the plagues, and my whole body took new strength through the Lord, and thus I passed on, as though I had never suffered. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But also in my heart I forgot the pains. Then spoke the Lord unto me in His great power and showed to me all that was and will be. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Now then, my children, in keeping these, you will not have the enemy plotting against you nor [evil] intentions in your mind because this is a charm (Phylacterion) from the Lord. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Rise then and gird these around you before I die in order that you may see the angels come at my parting so that you may behold with wonder the powers of God”. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then rose the one whose name was Day (Yemima) and girt herself; and immediately she departed her body, as her father had said, and she put on another heart, as if she never cared for earthly things. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And she sang angelic hymns in the voice of angels, and she chanted forth the angelic praise of God while dancing. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Then the other daughter, Kassia by name, put on the girdle, and her heart was transformed, so that she no longer wished for worldly things. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And her mouth assumed the dialect of the heavenly rulers (Archonts) and she sang the donology of the work of the High Place and if any one wishes to know the work of the heavens he may take an insight into the hymns of Kassia. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Then did the other daughter by the name of Amalthea’s Horn (Keren Happukh) gird herself and her mouth spoke in the language of those on high; for her heart was transformed, being lifted above the worldly things. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  She spoke in the dialect of the Cherubim, singing the praise of the Ruler of the cosmic powers (virtues) and extolling their (His) glory. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And he who desires to follow the vestiges of the ‘Glory of the Father’ will find them written down in the Prayers of Amalthea’s Horn. </p>
