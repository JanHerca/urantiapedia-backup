<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And my children, after having taken charge of the service, took their meals each day along with their three sisters beginning with the older brother, and made a feast. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I rose in the morning and offered as sin-offering for them fifty rams and nineteen sheep, and what remained as a residue was consecrated to the poor. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I said to them : “Take these as residue and pray for my children. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Perchance my sons have sinned before the Lord, speaking in haughtiness of spirit: We are children of this rich man. Ours are all these goods; why should we be servants of the poor’ </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And speaking thus in a haughty spirit they may have provoked the anger of God, for overbearing pride is an abomination before the Lord.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So I brought oxen as offerings to the priest at the altar saying: “May my children never think evil towards God in their hearts.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  While I lived in this manner, the Seducer could not bear to see the good [I did], and he demanded the warfare of God against me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he came upon me cruelly. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  First he burnt up the large number of sheep, then the camels, then he burnt up the cattle and all my herds; or they were captured not only by enemies but also by such as had received benefits from me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the shepherds came and announced that to me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But when I heard it, I gave praise to God and did not blaspheme. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And when the Seducer learned of my fortitude, he plotted new thing’s against me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He disguised himself as King of Persia and besieged my city, and after he had led off all that were therein, he spoke to them in malice, saying in boastful language: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  “This man Job who has obtained all the goods of the earth and left nothing for others, he has destroyed and torn down the temple of god. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Therefore shall I repay to him what he has done to the house of the great god. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Now come with me and we shall pillage all that is left in his house.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And they answered and said to him: “He has seven sons and three daughters. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Take heed lest they flee into other lands and they may become our tyrants and then come over us with force and kill us.’’ </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And he said: Be not at all afraid. His flocks and his wealth have I destroyed by fire, and the rest have I captured, and behold, his children shall I kill.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And having spoken thus, he went and threw the house upon my children and killed them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And my fellow-citizens, seeing that what was said by him had become true, came and pursued me, and robbed me of all that was in my house. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And I saw with mine own eyes the pillage of my house, and men without culture and without honor sat at my table and on my couches, and I could not remonstrate against them. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For I was exhausted like a woman with her loins let loose from multitude of pains, remembering chiefly that this warfare had been predicted to me by the Lord through His angel. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And I became like one who, when seeing the rough sea and the adverse winds, while the lading of the vessel in mid-ocean is too heavy, casts the burden into the sea, saying: </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  “I wish to destroy all this only in order to come safely into the city so that I may take as profit the rescued ship and the best of my things.” </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Thus did I manage my own affairs. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  But there came another messenger and announced to me the ruin of my own children, and I was shaken with terror. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And I tore my clothes and said: The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken. As it hath deemed best to the Lord, thus it hath come to be. May the name of the Lord be blessed.” </p>
