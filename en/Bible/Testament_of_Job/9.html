<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when I spoke thus to them, behold, there my wife Sitis came running, dressed in rags. from the service of the master by whom she was employed as slave though she had been forbidden to leave, lest the kings, on seeing her, might take her as captive. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when she came, she threw herself prostrate to their feet, crying and saying: “Remember’. Eliphaz and ye other friends, what I was once with you, and how I have changed, how I am now dressed to meet you’’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then the kings broke forth in great weeping and, being in double perplexity, they kept silent. But Eliphaz took his purple mantle and cast it about her to wrap herself up with it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But she asked him saying: “I ask as favor of you, my Lords, that you order your soldiers that they should dig among the ruins of our house which fell upon my children, so that their bones could be brought in a perfect state to the tombs. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Fir as we have, owing to our misfortune, no power at all, and so we may at least see their bones. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For have I like a brute the motherly feeling of wild beasts that my ten children should have perished on one day and not to one of them could I give a decent burial” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the kings gave order that the ruins of my house should be dug up. But I prohibited it, saving </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “Do not go to the trouble in vain; for my children will not he found, for they are in the keeping of their Maker and Ruler’’. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the kings answered and said : “Who will gainsay that he is out of his mind and raves </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For while we desire to bring the bones of his children back, he forbids us to do so saying: ‘They have been taken and placed the keeping of their Maker’. Therefore prove unto us the truth”. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But I said to them: “Raise me that I may stand up, and they lifted me, holding up my arms from both sides. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I stood upright, and pronounced first the praise of God and after the prayer I said to them : “Look with your eyes to the East’’. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And they looked and saw my children with crowns near the glory of the King, the Ruler of heaven. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when my wife Sitis saw this, she fell to the ground and prostrated [herself] before God, saying: “Now I know that my memory remains with the Lord”. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And after she had spoken this, and the evening came, she went to the city, back to the master whom she served as slave, and lay herself down at the manger of the cattle and died there from exhaustion. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And when her despotic master searched for her and did not find her, he came to the fold of his herds, and there he saw her stretched out upon the manger dead, while all the animals around were crying about her. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And all who saw her wept and lamented, and the cry extended throughout the whole city. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the people brought her down and wrapt her up and buried her by the house which had fallen upon her children. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the poor of the city made a great mourning for her and said: “Behold this Sitis whose like in nobility and in glory is not found in any woman. Alas ! she was not found worthy of a proper tomb!” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The dirge for her you will find in the record. </p>
