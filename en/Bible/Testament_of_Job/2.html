<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After this I rose up in the night and took fifty slaves and went to the temple of the idol and destroyed it to the ground. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And so I went back to my house and gave orders that the door should he firmly locked; saying to my doorkeepers : </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  ‘If somebody shall ask for me, bring no report to me, but tell him : He investigates urgent affairs. He is inside’. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Satan disguised himself as a beggar and knocked heavily at the door, saying to the door-keeper: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  ‘Report to Job and say that I desire to meet him’, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the door-keeper came in and told me that, but heard from me that I was studying. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The Evil One, having failed in this, went away and took upon his shoulder an old, torn basket and went in and spoke to the doorkeeper saying: ‘Tell Job : Give me bread from thine hands that I may eat’. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when I heard this, I gave her burnt bread to give it to him, and I made known to him : ‘Expect not to eat of my bread, for it is forbidden to thee’. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But the door-keeper, being ashamed to hand him the burnt and ashy bread, as she did not know that it was Satan, took of her own fine bread and gave it to him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But he took it and, knowing what occured, said to the maiden : ‘Go hence, bad servant, and bring me the bread that was given thee to hand to me’. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the servant cried and spoke in grief: ‘Thou speakest the truth, saying that I am a bad servant because I have not done as I was instructed by my master’. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he turned back and brought him the burnt bread and said to him : ‘Thus says my lord : Thou shalt not eat of my bread anymore, for it is forbidden to thee. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And this he gave me [saying: This I give] in order that the charge may not be brought against me that I did not give to the enemy who asked’.) </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when Satan heard this, he sent back the servant to me, saying: ‘As thou seest this bread all burnt, so shall I soon burn thy body to make it like this’. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I replied: ‘Do what thou desirest to do and accomplish whatever thou plottest. For I am ready to endure whatever thou bringest upon me’. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And when the devil heard this, he left me, and walking up to under the [highest] heaven, he took from the Lord the oath that he might have power, over all my possessions. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And after having taken the power he went and instantly took away all my wealth. </p>
