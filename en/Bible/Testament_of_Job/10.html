<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But Eliphaz and those that were with him were astonished at these things, and they sat down with me and replying to me, spoke in boastful words concerning me for twenty seven days. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They repeated it again and again that I suffered deservedly thus for having committed many sins, and that there was no hope left for me, but I retorted to these men in zest of contention myself. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they rose in anger, ready to part in wrathful spirit. But Elihu conjured them to stay yet a little while until he would have shown them what it was. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “For”, said he, “so many days did you pass, allowing Job to boast that he is just. But I shall no longer suffer it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For from the beginning did I continue crying over him, remembering his former happiness. But now he speaks boastfully and in overbearing pride he says that he has his throne in the heavens. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Therefore, hear me, and I will tell you what is the cause of his destiny. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then, imbued with the spirit of Satan. Elihu spoke hard words which are written down in the records left of Elihu. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And after he had ended, God appeared to me in a storm and in clouds, and spoke blaming Elihu and showing me that he who had spoken was not a man, but a wild beast. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when God had finished speaking to me, the Lord spoke to Eliphaz: “Thou and thy friends have sinned in that ye have not spoken the truth concerning my servant Job. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore rise up and make him bring a sin-offering for you in order that your sins may be forgiven; for were it not for him, I would have destroyed you”. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And so they brought to me all that belonged to a sacrifice, and I took it and brought for them a sin-offering, and the Lord received it favorably and forgave them their wrong. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then when Eliphaz, Baldad and Sophar saw that God had graciously pardoned their sin through His servant Job, but that He did not deign to pardon Elihu, then did Eliphaz begin to sing a hymn, while the others responded, their soldiers also joining while standing by the altar. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Eliphaz spoke thus “Taken off is the sin and our injustice gone; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But Elihu, the evil one, shall have no remembrance among the living; his luminary is extinguished and has lost its light. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The glory of his lamp will announce itself for him, for he is the son of darkness. and not of light. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The doorkeepers of the place of darkness shall give him their glory and beauty as share; His Kingdom hath vanished, his throne hath moldered, and the honor of his stature is in (Sheol) Hades. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For he has loved the beauty of the serpent and the scales (skins) of’ the dracon his gall and his venom belongs to the Northern One (Zphuni = Adder). </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For he did not own himself unto the Lord nor did he fear him, but he hated those whom He hath chosen (known). </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thus God forgot him, and ‘the holy ones’ forsook him, his wrath and anger shall be unto him desolation and he will have no mercy in his heart nor peace, because he, had the venom of an adder on his tongue. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Righteous is the Lord, and His judgments are true, With him there is no preference of person, for He judgeth all alike. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Behold, the Lord cometh! Behold, the ‘holy ones’ have been prepared: The crowns and the prizes of the victors precede them! </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Let the saints rejoice, and let their hearts exult in gladness; for they shall receive the glory which is in store for them. </p>
<p> <i>Chorus.</i> </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Our sins are forgiven, our injustice has been cleansed, but Elihu hath no remembrance among the living”. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  After Eliphaz had finished the hymn, we rose and went back to the city, each to the house where they lived. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And the people made a feast for me in gratitude and delight of God, and all my friends came back to me. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And all those who had seen me in my former state of happiness, asked me saying: “What are those three things here amongst us” </p>
