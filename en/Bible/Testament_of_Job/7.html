<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  At this time the kings heard what had happened to me and they rose and came to me each from his land to visit me and to comfort me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when they came near me, they cried with a loud voice and each tore his clothes. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And after they had prostrated themselves, touching the earth with their heads, they sat down next to me for seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They were four in numbers: Eliplaz, the king of Teman, and Balad, and Sophar, and Elilhu. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when they had taken their seat, they conversed about what had happened to me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now when for time first time they had come to me and I had shown them my precious stones, they were astonished and said : </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “If of us three kings all our possessions would be brought together into one, it would not come up to the precious stones of .Jobab’s kingdom (crown). For thou art of greater nobility than all the people of the East. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when, therefore, they now came to the land of Ausitis “Uz” to visit me, they asked in the city : “Where is Jobab, the ruler of this whole land” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And they told them concerning me: “He sitteth upon the dung-hill outside of the city for he has not entered the city’ for seven years”. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And then again they- inquired concerning my possessions, and there was revealed to them all that happened to me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And when they had learned this, they went out of the city with the inhabitants, and my fellow-citizens pointed me out to them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But these remonstrated and said: “Surely, this is not Jobab”. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And while they hesitated, there said Eliphaz the King of Teman: “Come let us step near and see.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And when they came near I remembered them, and I wept very much when I learned the purpose of their journey. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I threw earth upon my head, and while shaking my head I revealed unto them that I was [Job]. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And when they saw me shake my head they threw themselves down upon the ground, all overcome with emotion </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And while their hosts were standing around, I saw the three kings lie upon the ground for three hours like dead. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then they rose and said to each other: We cannot believe that this is Jobab”. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And finally, after they had for seven day’s inquired after everything concerning me and searched for my flocks and other possessions, they said: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  “Do we not know how many goods were sent by him to the cities and the villages round about to be given to the poor, aside from all that was given away by him within his own house How then could he have fallen into such a state of perdition and misery !” </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And after the seven days Elihu said to the kings : “Come let us step near and examine him accurately, whether he truly is Jobab or not” </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And they, being not half a mile (stadium) distant from his malodorous body, they rose and stepped near, carrying perfume in their hands, while their soldiers went with them and threw fragrant incense round about them so that they could come near me. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And after they had thus passed three hours, covering the way with aroma, they drew nigh. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Eliphaz began and said : “Art thou, indeed, Job, our fellow-king Art thou the one who owned the great glory </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Art thou he who once shone like the sun of day upon the whole earth Art thou he who once resembled the moon and the stars effulgent throughout the night” </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And I answered him and said: “I am”, and thereupon all wept and lamented, and they sang a royal song of lamentation, their whole army joining them in a chorus. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And again Eliphaz said to me : “Art thou he who had ordered seven thousand sheep to be given for the clothing of the poor Whither, then hath gone the glory of thy throne </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Art thou he who had ordered three thousand cattle to do the plowing of the field for the poor Wither, then hath thy glory gone! </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Art thou he who had golden couches, and now thou sittest upon a dung hill [“Whither then hath thy glory gone !”] </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Art thou he who had sixty tables set for the poor Art thou he who had censer’s for the fine perfume made of precious stones, and now thou art in a malodorous state Whither then hath thy glory gone! </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Art thou he who had golden candelabras set upon silver stands; and now must thou long for the natural gleam of the moon [“Whither then hath thy glory gone !”] </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Art thou the one who had ointment made of the spices of frankincense, and now thou art in a state of repulsiveness! [“Whither then hath thy glory gone !”] </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Art thou he who laughed the wrong doers and sinners to scorn and now thou hast become a laughingstock to all! [“Whither then hath thine glory gone”] </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And when Eliphaz had for a long time cried and lamented, while all the others joined him, so that the commotion was very great, I said to them : </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Be silent and I will show you my throne, and the glory of its splendor: My glory will be everlasting. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  The whole world shall perish, and its glory shall vanish, and all those who hold fast to it, will remain beneath, but my throne is in the upper world and its glory and splendor will be to the right of the Savior in the heavens. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  My throne exists in the life of the “holy ones” and its glory in the imperishable world. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  For rivers will he dried up and their arrogance shall go down to the depth of the abyss, but the streams of my land in which my throne is erected, shall not dry up, but shall remain unbroken in strength. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  The kings perish and the rulers vanish, and their glory and pride is as the shadow in a looking glass, but my Kingdom lasts forever and ever, and its glory and beauty is in the chariot of my Father. </p>
