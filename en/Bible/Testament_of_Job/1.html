<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  On the day he became sick and (he) knew that he would have to leave his bodily abode, he called his seven sons and his three daughters together and spake to them as follows: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Form a circle around me, children, and hear, and I shall relate to you what the Lord did for me and all that happened to me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I am Job your father. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Know ye then my children, that you are the generation of a chosen one and take heed of your noble birth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For I am of the sons of Esau. My brother is Nahor, and your mother is Dinah. By her have I become your father. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For my first wife died with my other ten children in bitter death. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Hear now, children, and I will reveal unto you what happened to me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I was a very rich man living in the East in the land Ausitis, (Utz) and before the Lord had named me Job, I was called Jobab. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The beginning of my trial was thus. Near my house there was the idol of one worshipped by the people; and I saw constantly burnt-offerings brought to him as a god. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then I pondered and said to myself: ‘Is this he who made heaven and earth, the sea and us all How will I know the truth’ </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And in that night as I lay asleep, a voice came and called: ‘Jobab! Jobab! rise up, and I will tell thee who is the one whom thou wishest to know. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  This, however, to whom the people bring burnt-offerings and libations, is not God, but this is the power and work of the Seducer (Satan) by which he beguiles the people’. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And when I heard this, I fell upon the earth and I prostrated myself saying: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  ‘O my Lord who speakest for the salvation of my soul. I pray thee, if this is the idol of Satan, I pray thee, let me go hence and destroy it and purify this spot. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For there is none that can forbid me doing this, as I am the king of this land, so that those that live in it will no longer be led astray’. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the voice that spoke out of the flame answered to me: ‘Thou canst purify this spot. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But behold I announce to thee what the Lord ordered me to tell thee, For I am the archangel of the God’. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And I said : ‘Whatever shall be told to his servant. I shall hear’. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And the archangel, said to me : ‘Thus speaketh the Lord: If thou undertakest to destroy and takest away the image of Satan, he will set himself with wrath to wage war against thee, and he will display against thee all his malice. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He will bring upon thee many severe plagues, and take from thee all that thou hast. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He will take away thine children, and will inflict many evils upon thee. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then thou must wrestle like an athlete and resist pain, sure of thy reward, overcome trials and afflictions. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But when thou endurest, I shall make thy name renowned throughout all generations of the earth until to the end of the world. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And I shall restore thee to all that thou hadst had, and the double part of what thou shalt lose will be given to thee in order that thou mayest know that God does not consider the person but giveth to each who deserveth the good. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And also to thee shall it be given, and thou shalt put on a crown of amarant. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And at the resurrection thou shalt awaken for eternal life. Then shalt thou know that he Lord is just, and true and mighty’. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Whereupon, my children, I replied: ‘I shall from love of God endure until death all that will come upon me, and I shall not shrink back’. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Then the angel put his seal upon me and left me. </p>
