<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For I had one hundred and thirty thousand sheep, and of these I separated seven thousand for the clothing of orphans and widows and of needy and sick ones. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I had a herd of eight hundred dogs who watched my sheep and besides these two hundred to watch my house. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I had nine mills working for the whole city and ships to carry goods, and I seat them into every city and into the villages to the feeble and sick and to those that were unfortunate. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I had three hundred and forty thousand nomadic asses, and of these I set aside five hundred, and the offspring of these I order to he sold and the proceeds to be given to the poor and the needy. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For from all the lands the poor came to meet me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the four doors of my house were opened, each, being in charge of a watchman who had to see whether there were any people coming asking alms, and whether they would see me sitting at one of the door’s so that they could leave through the other and take whatever they needed. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I also had thirty immovable tables set at all hours for the strangers alone, and I also had twelve tables spread for the widows. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And if any one came asking for alms, he found food on my table to take all he needed, and I turned nobody away to leave my door with an empty stomach. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I also had three thousand five hundred yokes of oxen, and I selected of these five hundred and had them tend to the plowing. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And with these I had done all the work in each field by those who would, take it in charge and the income of their crops I laid aside for the poor on their table. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I also had fifty bakeries from which I sent [the bread] to the table for the poor. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I had slaves selected for their service. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  There were also some strangers who saw my good will; they wished to serve as waiters themselves. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Others, being in distress and unable to obtain a living, came with the request saying: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  “We pray thee, since we also can fill this office of waiters (deacons) and have no possession, have pity upon us and advance money to us in order that we may go into the great cities and sell merchandise. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the surplus of our profit we may give as help to the poor, and then shaII we return to thee thine own (money). </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And when I heard this, I was glad that they should take this altogether from me for the husbandry of charity for the poor. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And with a willing heart I gave them what they wanted, and I accepted their written bond, but would not take any other security from them except the written document. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And they went abroad and gave to time poor as far as they were successful. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Frequently, however, some of their goods were lost on the road or on the sea, or they would he robbed of them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Then they would come and say: ‘We pray thee, act generously towards us in order that we may see how we can restore to you thine own’. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And when I heard this, I had sympathy with them, and handed to them their bond, and often having read it before them tore it up and released them of their debt saying to them : </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  ‘What I have consecrated for the benefit of the poor, I shall not take from you’. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And so I accepted nothing from my debtor. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And when a man with cheerful heart came to me saying: I am not in need to be compelled to he a paid worker for the poor. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But I wish to serve the needy at thy table”, and he consented to work, and he ate his share. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  So I gave him his wages nevertheless, and I went home rejoicing. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And when he did not wish to take it, I forced him to do so, saying: “I know that thou art a laboring man who looks for and waits for his wages, and thou must take it.” </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Never did I defer paying the wages of the hireling or any other, nor keep back in my house for a single evening his hire that was due to him. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Those that milked the cows and the ewes signaled to the passersby that they should take their share. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For the milk flowed in such plenty that it curdled into butter on the hills and by the road side; and by the rocks and the hills the cattle lay which had given birth to their offspring. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For my servants grew weary keeping the meat of the widows and the poor and dividing it into small pieces. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  For they would curse and say: “Oh that we had of his flesh that we could be satisfied”, although I was very kind to them, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  I also had six harps [and six slaves to play the harps] and also a cithara, a decachord, and I struck it during the day. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And I took the cithara, and the widows responded after their meals. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And with the musical instrument I reminded them of God that they should give praise to the Lord. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And when my female slaves would murmur, then I took the musical instruments and played as much as they would have done for their wages, and gave them respite from their labor and sighs. </p>
