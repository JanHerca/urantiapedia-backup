<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and [when they come] from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.) </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But in vain do they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given [to God]; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  [If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.] </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, [it] cannot defile him; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? [This he said], making all meats clean. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </p>
