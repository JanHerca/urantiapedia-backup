<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove [it] from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Prophesy ye not, [thus] they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely [as men] averse from war. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, [saying], I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them. </p>
