<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge [is ready] for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see [my desire] upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. </p>
