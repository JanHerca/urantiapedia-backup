<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah's controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember] from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and [the man of] wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people. </p>
