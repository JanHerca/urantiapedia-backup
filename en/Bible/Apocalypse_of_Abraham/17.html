<p> <i>Abraham, taught by the Angel, utters the Celestial Song and prays for Enlightenment (Chapter XVII.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And while he yet spake (and) lo! fire came against us round about, and a voice was in the fire like a voice of many waters, like the sound of the sea in its uproar. And the angel bent his head with me and worshipped. And I desired to fall down upon the earth, and the high place, on which we stood, [at one moment rose upright,] but at another rolled downwards. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he said: “Only worship, Abraham, and utter the song which I have taught thee;” because there was no earth to fall upon. And I worshipped only, and uttered the song which he had taught me. And he said: “Recite without ceasing.” And I recited, and he also himself with me recited the song: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Eternal, mighty, Holy, El, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God only—Supreme! </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou who art self-originated, incorruptible, spotless, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Uncreate, immaculate, immortal, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-complete, self-illuminating; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Without father, without mother, unbegotten, Exalted, fiery One! </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lover of men, benevolent, bountiful, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  jealous over me and very compassionate; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Eli, that is, My God— </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Eternal, mighty holy Sabaoth, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  very glorious El, El, El, El, Jaoel! </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou art He whom my soul hath loved! </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Eternal Protector, shining like fire, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whose voice is like the thunder, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Whose look is like the lightning, all-seeing, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Who receiveth the prayers of such as honour Thee! </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  [And turneth away from the requests of such as embarrass with the embarrassment of their provocations, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Who dissolveth the confusions of the world which arise from the ungodly and righteous in the corruptible age, renewing the age of the righteous!] </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou, O Light, shinest before the light of the </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  morning upon Thy creatures, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  [so that it becometh day upon the earth,] </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And in Thy heavenly dwelling places there is no </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need of any other light </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  than (that) of the unspeakable splendour from the </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lights of Thy countenance. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Accept my prayer [and be well-pleased with it], </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  likewise also the sacrifice which Thou hast prepared </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee through me who sought Thee! </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Accept me favourably, and shew me, and teach me, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And make known to Thy servant as thou hast promised me! </p>
