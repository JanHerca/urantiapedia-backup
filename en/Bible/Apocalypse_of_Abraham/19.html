<p> <i>God discloses to Abraham the Powers of Heaven (Chapter XIX.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And a voice came to me out of the midst of the fire, saying: “Abraham, Abraham!” I said: “Here am I!” And He said: “Consider the expanses which are under the firmament on which thou art (now) placed, and see how on no single expanse is there any other but He whom thou hast sought, or who hath loved thee.” And while He was yet speaking (and) lo! the expanses opened, and beneath me the heavens. And I saw upon the seventh firmament upon which I stood a fire widely extended, and light, and dew, and a multitude of angels, and a power of invisible glory over the living creatures which I saw; but no other being did I see there. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I looked from the mountain in which I stood [dow nwards] to the sixth firmament, and saw there a multitude of angels, of (pure) spirit, without bodies, who carried out the commands of the fiery angels who were upon the eighth firmament, as I was standing suspended over them. And behold, upon this firmament there were no other powers of (any) other form, but only angels of (pure) spirit, like the power which I saw on the seventh firmament. And He commanded that the sixth firmament should be taken away. And I saw there, on the fifth firmament, the powers of the stars which carry out the commands laid upon them, and the elements of the earth obeyed them. </p>
