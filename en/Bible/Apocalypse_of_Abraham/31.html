<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  “And then I will sound the trumpet out of the air, and will send mine Elect One, having in him all my power, one measure ; and this one shall summon my despised people from the nations, and I will burn with fire those who have insulted them and who have ruled among them in (this) Age.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “And I will give those who have covered me with mockery to the scom of the coming Age; and I have prepared them to be food for the fire of Hades and for ceaseless flight to and fro through the air in the underworld beneath the earth [the body filled with worms]. For on them shall they see the righteousness of the Creator—those, namely, who have chosen to do my will, and those who have openly kept my commandments, (and) they shall rejoice with joy over the downfall of the men who still remain, who have followed the idols and their murders. For they shall putrefy in the body of the evil worm Azazel, and be burnt with the fire of Azazel's tongue; for I hoped that they would come to me, and not have loved and praised the strange (god), and not have adhered to him for whom they were not allotted, but (instead) they have forsaken the migh ty Lord.” </p>
