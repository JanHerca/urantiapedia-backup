<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I rose up and saw him who had grasped me by my right hand and set me up upon my feet: and the appearance of his body was like sapphire, and the look of his countenance like chrysolite, and the hair of his head like snow, and the turban upon his head like the appearance of the rainbow, and the clothing of his garments like purple; and a golden sceptre was in his right hand. And he said to me: “Abraham!” And I said: “Here am I, thy servant.” And he said: “Let not my look affright thee, nor my speech, that thy soul be not perturbed. Come with me and I will go with thee, until the sacrifice, visible, but after the sacrifice, invisible for ever. Be of good cheer, and come!” </p>
