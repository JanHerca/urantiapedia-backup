<p> <i>Why Sin is permitted (Chapter XXVI.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I said: “O Eternal, Mighty One! Wherefore hast Thou established that it should be so, and then proclaim the knowledge thereof?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He said to me: “Hear, Abraham; understand what I say to thee, and answer me as I question thee. Why did thy father Terah not listen to thy voice, and (why) did he not cease from the devilish idolatry until he perished [and] his whole household with him?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I said: “O Eternal, [Mighty One]! (It was) entirely because he did not choose to listen to me; but I, too, did not follow his works.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And He said [to me]: “Hear, Abraham. As the counsel of thy father is in him, and as thy counsel is in thee, so also is the counsel of my will in me ready for the coming days, before thou hast knowledge of these, or (canst) see with thine eyes what is future in them. How those of thy seed will be, look in the picture.” </p>
