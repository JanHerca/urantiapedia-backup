<p> <i>A Vision of Judgement and Salvation (Chapter XXVII.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I looked and saw: lo! the picture swayed and [from it] emerged, on its left side, a heathen people, and they pillaged those who were on the right side, men and women and children: [some they slaughtered,] others they retained with themselves. Lo! I saw them run towards them through four entrances, and they burnt the Temple with fire, and the holy things that were therein they plundered. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I said: “O Eternal One! Lo! the people (that spring) from me, whom Thou hast accepted, the hordes of the heathen do plunder, and some they kill, while others they hold fast as aliens, and the Temple they have burnt with fire, and the beautiful things therein they do rob [and destroy]. O Eternal, Mighty One! If this be so, wherefore hast Thou now lacerated my heart, and why should this be so?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And He said to me: “Hear, Abraham. What thou hast seen shall happen on account of thy seed who anger me by reason of the statue which thou sawest, and on account of the human slaughter in the picture, through zeal in the Temple; and as thou sawest so shall it be.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I said: “O Eternal, Mighty One! May the works of evil (wrought) in ungodliness now pass by, but (show me) rather those who fulfilled the commandments, even the works of his (?) righteousness. For thou canst do this.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And He said to me: “The time of the righteous meeteth [them] first through the holiness (flowing) from kings and righteous-dealing rulers whom I at first created in order from such to rule among them. But from these issue men who care for their interests, as I have made known to thee and thou hast seen.” </p>
