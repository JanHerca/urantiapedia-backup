<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass while I spake thus to my father Terah in the court of my house, there cometh down the voice of a Mighty One from heaven in a fiery cloud-burst, saying and crying: “Abraham, Abraham!” And I said: “Here am I.” And He said: “Thou art seeking in the understanding of thine heart the God of Gods and the Creator: I am He: Go out from thy father Terah, and get thee out from the house, that thou also be not slain in the sins of thy father's house.” And I went out. And it came to pass when I went out, that before I succeeded in getting out in front of the door of the court, there came a sound of a [great] thunder and burnt him and his house and everything whatsoever in his house, down to the ground, forty cubits. </p>
