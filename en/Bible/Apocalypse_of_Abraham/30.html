<p> <i>The Punishment of the Heathen and the Ingathering of Israel (Chapters XXX.-XXXI.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But while He was still speaking, I found myself upon the earth. And I said: “O Eternal, [Mighty One], I am no longer in the glory in which I was (while) on high, and what my soul longed to understand in mine heart I do not understand.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He said to me: “What is desired in thine heart I will tell thee, because thou hast sought to see the ten plagues which I have prepared for the heathen, and have prepared beforehand at the passing over of the twelfth hour of the earth. Hear what I divulge to thee, so shall it come to pass: the first (is) pain of great distress; the second, conflagration of many citie; the third, destruction and pestilence of animals ; the fourth, hunger of the whole world and of its people t the fifth by destruction among its rulers, destruction by earthquake and the sword; the sixth, multiplication of hail and snow; the seventh, the wild beasts will be their grave; the eighth, hunger and pestilence will alternate with their destruction; the ninth, punishment by the sword and flight in distress; the tenth, thunder and voices and destructive earthquake.” </p>
