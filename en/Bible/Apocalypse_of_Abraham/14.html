<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The angel said to me: [“Abraham!” And I said: “Here am I, thy servant.” And he said: “Know from henceforth that the Eternal One hath chosen thee, (He) whom thou lovest; be of good courage and use this authority, so far as I bid thee, against him who slandereth truth; should I not be able to put him to shame who hath scattered over the earth the secrets of heaven and hath rebelled against the Mighty One?] Say to him: 'Be thou the burning coal of the Furnace of the earth; go, Azazel, into the inaccessible parts of the earth; [for thy heritage is (to be) over those existing with thee being born with the stars and clouds, with the men whose portion thou art, and (who) through thy being exist; and thine enmity is justification. On this account by thy perdition disappear from me.” And I uttered the words which the angel had taught me. And he said: “Abraham!” And I said: “Here am I, thy servant.”] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the angel said to me: “Answer him not; for God hath given him power (lit. will) over those who do answer him.” [And the angel spake to me a second time and said: “Now rather, however much he speak to thee, answer him not, that his will may have no free course in thee, because the Eternal and Mighty One hath given him weight and will; answer him not.” I did what was commanded me by the angel;] and however much he spake to me, I answered him nothing whatsoever. </p>
