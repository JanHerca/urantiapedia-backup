<p> <i>How long? (Chapters XXVIII.-XXIX.).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I answered and said: “O Mighty, [Eternal One] hallowed by Thy power! Be favourable to my petition, [for for this hast Thou brought me up here—and shew me]. As Thou hast brought me up to Thy height, so make [this] known to me, Thy beloved one, as much as I ask—whether what I saw shall happen to them for long?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He showed me a multitude of His people, and said to me: “On their account through four issues, as thou sawest, I shall be provoked by them, and in these my retribution for their deeds shall be (accomplished). But in the fourth outgoing of a hundred years and one hour of the age—the same is a hundred years—it shall be in misfortune among the heathen [but one hour in mercy and contumely, as among the heathen].” </p>
