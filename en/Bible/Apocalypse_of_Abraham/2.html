<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he made five other gods, and gave them to me [and] commanded me to sell them outside in the street of the town. And I saddled my father's ass, and placed them upon it, and went towards the inn to sell them. And lo! merchants from Fandana in Syria were travelling with camels going to Egypt, to trade. And I spoke with them. And one of their camels uttered a groan, and the ass took fright and sprang away and upset the gods; and three of them were smashed, and two were preserved. And it came to pass, when the Syrians saw that I had gods, they said to me: “Why didst thou not tell us [that thou hadst gods? Then we would have bought them] before the ass heard the sound of the camel, and they would not have been lost. Give us, at any rate, the gods that remain, and we will give thee the proper price for the broken gods, also for the gods that have been preserved.” For I was concerned in my heart as to how I could bring to my father the purchase—price, and the three broken ones I cast into the water of the river Gur, which was at that place, and they sank into the depths, and there was nothing more of them. </p>
