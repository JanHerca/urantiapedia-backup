<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And while I cogitated thus, I reached my father's house; and having watered the ass, and set out hay for it, I brought the silver and gave it into the hand of my father Terah. When he saw it he was glad, [and] he said: “Blessed art thou, Abraham, of my gods, because thou hast brought the price of the gods, so that my work was not in vain.” And I answered and said to him: “Hear, O my father, Terah! Blessed are the gods of thee, for thou art their god, since thou hast made them; for their blessing is ruination, and their power is vain they who did not help themselves, how shall they, then, help thee or bless? I have been kind to thee in this affair, because by (using) my intelligence, I have brought thee the money for the broken gods.” And when he heard word, he became furiously angry with me, because I had spoken hard words against his gods. </p>
