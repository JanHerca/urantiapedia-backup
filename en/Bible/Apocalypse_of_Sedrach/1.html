<p> <i>A sermon by the holy and blessed Sedrach on love, and repentance, and Orthodox Christians, and on the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Master, grant (thy) blessing.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Beloved, we must prefer nothing more than unfeigned love. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We commit many faults every hour, day and night, and for this reason let us acquire love, because it covers a multitude of sins. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What do we gain, my children, if we possess everything yet do not have saving love? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  How does one benefit, my children, if one gives a great banquet and invites king and nobleman and prepares every sort of expensive fare in order that nothing should be missing; nevertheless, if there is no salt, that banquet cannot be eaten; and one not only bears the expense but one also wastes (his) efforts and is disgraced by the guests. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  It is the same in our situation, my brethren; what will we profit, for what grace do we possess without love? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Our every deed is false, even if one has virginity and fasts and keeps vigil and prays and gives a banquet for the poor. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if one brings gifts to God, or offers the first fruits of all his goods, or builds churches or does anything else without love, it shall be counted by God as nothing, for (these things) are not acceptable. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thus the prophet says: “The sacrifice of the impious is an abomination to the Lord.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Do not be advised to do anything without love. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If you say, “I hate my brother but I love Christ,” you are a liar, and John the Theologian rebukes you, for how can one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, love God whom he has not seen? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  It is clear that anyone who hates his brother but thinks that he loves Christ is a liar and is deluding himself. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For John the Theologian says that we have this commandment from God, that he who loves God should also love his brother. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And again the Lord himself says, “Upon these two (commandments) depend all the law and the prophets.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Oh, how extraordinary and paradoxical is the miracle that he who has love fulfills all the law; love is the fulfilment of the law. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Oh, power of love beyond imagination; oh, power of love beyond measure! </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There is nothing more honorable than love, nor is there anything greater either in heaven or on the earth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  This divine love is the capital (virtue); among all the virtues love is the highest perfection in the world. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  It dwelt in the heart of Abel; it worked together with the Patriarchs; it guarded Moses; it made David the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; it strengthened Joseph. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But why do I say these things? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The most important is that this love brought the Son of God down from heaven. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Through love all good things were revealed; death was trampled down, Hades was made captive, Adam was recalled (from death), and through love one flock was made thereafter of angels and men. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Through love Paradise has been opened; the kingdom of heaven is promised; the waste places it made (into) cities, and filled the mountains and the caves with song; it taught men and women who were treading the narrow and sorrowful path. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But how long shall we prolong this sermon on the achievements of love which even the angels cannot accomplish? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Oh, blessed love which bestows all good things! </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Blessed is the man who possesses true faith and unfeigned love; for, as the Master said, nothing is greater than love for which a man lays down (his) life for his friends. </p>
