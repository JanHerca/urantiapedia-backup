<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And God said to him, “Be it known to you, that everything which I commanded man to do was within his reach. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I made him wise and the heir of heaven and earth, and I subordinated everything under him and every living thing flees from him and from his face. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Having received my gifts, however, he became an alien, an adulterer and sinner. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Tell me, what sort of a father would give an inheritance to his son, and having received the money (the son) goes away leaving his father, and becomes an alien and in the service of aliens. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The father then, seeing that the son has forsaken him (and gone away), darkens his heart and going away, he retrieves his wealth and banishes his son from his glory because he forsook his father. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  How is it that I, the wondrous and jealous God, have given everything to him, but he, having received them, became an adulterer and sinner?” </p>
