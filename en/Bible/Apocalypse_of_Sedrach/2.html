<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he heard a hidden? voice in his ears: “Here, Sedrach, you who wish and desire to talk with God and to ask him to reveal to you the things that you wish to ask.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Sedrach said, “What (is it), my Lord?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the voice said to him, “I was sent to you that I may carry you up into heaven.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he said, “I want to speak to God face to face, but I am not able, Lord, to ascend into the heavens.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But the angel, having stretched out his wings, took him and went up into the heavens, and took him up as far as the third heaven, and the flame of the divinity stood there. </p>
