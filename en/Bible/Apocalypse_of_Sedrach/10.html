<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Sedrach said to God, “From where will you take my soul, from which member?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God said to him, “Do you not know that it is placed in the middle of your lungs and your heart and that it is spread out to all the members? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  It is removed through the pharynx and larynx and the mouth; and whenever it is due to go out (from the body) it is drawn with difficulty at the beginning and as it comes together from the fingernails and from all the members there is, of necessity, a great strain? in being separated from the body and detached from the heart.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When he had heard all these things, and recalled the memory of death, Sedrach was very troubled and he said to God, “Lord, give me a little while that I may cry, for I have heard that tears accomplish much and can become a sufficient cure for the humble body of your creatures.” </p>
