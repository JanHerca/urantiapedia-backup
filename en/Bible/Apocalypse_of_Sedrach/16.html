<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Lord said to Sedrach, “I made man in three stages; when he is young, I overlook his mistakes because of his youth; again, when he is a man I watch over his mind; again, when he grows old I preserve him so that he may repent.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sedrach said, “Lord, you know and are acquainted with all this; yet have compassion with sinners.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Lord said to him, “My beloved Sedrach, I promise to have compassion even less than forty days, as far as twenty, and whoever remembers your name will not see the place of punishment but he will be with the just ones in a place of refreshment and rest, and the sin of him who copies this admirable sermon will not be reckoned for ever and ever.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Sedrach said, “‘Lord, also whoever preforms a liturgy in honor of your servant, rescue him, Lord, from all evil.” And the servant of God, Sedrach, said, “Now, Master, take my soul.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And God took him and put him in Paradise with all the saints. eTo him be glory and power for ever and ever, amen. </p>
