<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Sedrach said to the archangel Michael, “Hear me, strong protector; help me and intercede that God may be merciful to the world.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And falling upon their faces, they besought God and said, “Lord, teach us in what way and through what repentance man may be saved, or by what labor.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  God said, “By repentances, supplications, and liturgies, through draining tears and fervant groanings. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Do you not know that my prophet David (was saved) because of tears, and that the rest were saved in one moment? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  You know, Sedrach, that there are nations which have no law, yet fulfill the law; they are not baptized, but my divine spirit enters them and they are converted to my baptism, and I receive them with my righteous ones in the bosom of Abraham. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And there are some baptized with my baptism and anointed with my divine myrrh, but they have become full of despair and they will not change their mind. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yet I await them with much pity and much rich mercy, that they may repent. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But they do that which my divinity hates, and they did not hear the wise man who asked and said, ‘We in no way justify the sinner.’ </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Are you not at all aware that it is written, ‘And those who have repented will not see punishment’? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And they heard neither the apostles nor my word in the Gospels and they cause sorrow to my angels, and of a certainty in my meetings and in my liturgies they do not heed my angel and they do not stand in my holy churches; they stand and do not prostrate (themselves) in fear and trembling but they pronounce long words‘ which neither I nor my angels accept.” </p>
