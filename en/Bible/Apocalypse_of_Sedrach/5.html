<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Sedrach said to him, “It was by your will that Adam was deceived, my Master. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  You commanded your angels to worship Adam, but he who was first among the angels disobeyed your order and did not worship him; and so you banished him, because he transgressed your commandment and did not come forth (to worship) the creation of your hands. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If you loved man, why did you not kill the devil, the artificer of all iniquity? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who can fight against an invisible spirit? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He enters the hearts of men like a smoke and teaches them all kinds of sin. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He even fights against you, the immortal God, and so what can pitiful man do against him? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yet have mercy, Master, and destroy punishment; otherwise receive me also with the sinners, for if you will not be merciful with the sinners, where are your mercies and where is your compassion, O Lord?” </p>
