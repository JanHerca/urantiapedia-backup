<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Sedrach said to him, “Your discipline? is punishment? and fire; and they are very bitter, my Lord. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  It would be better for man if he were not born. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indeed, what have you done, my Lord; for what reason did you labor with your spotless hands and create man, since you did not desire to have mercy upon him?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  God said to him, “I created the first man, Adam, and placed him in Paradise in the midst of (which is) the tree of life, and I said to him, ‘Eat of all the fruit, only beware of the tree of life, for if you eat from it you will surely die.’ </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  However, he disobeyed my commandment and having been deceived by the devil he ate from the tree.” </p>
