<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And crying and lamenting he started saying, “O wondrous head, ornamented like heaven; O sunlight upon heaven and earth; your hair is known from Theman, your eyes from Bosra, your ears from thunder, your tongue from bugle, and your brain is a small creation; the head, the movement of the whole body, is trustworthy and very beautiful, beloved of all but as soon as it falls in the earth it is unrecognized. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O hands which hold so well, which are easily taught and hard-working, through which the body is fed. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O hands so adept, gathering materials, together you ornamented houses. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O fingers, beautified and adorned with gold and silver; even great structures are made by the fingers; the three joints stretch the palms and they gather good things together; but now you have become strangers to this world. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O feet, which walk so well, moving by themselves so very quickly and untiring. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O knees, thus joined, without you the body does not move; the feet run together with the sun and the moon, night and day, gathering all things together, food and drink which nourish the body. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O feet, so swift and well moving, stirring up the face of the earth and ornamenting houses with every good thing. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O feet, which bear the whole body, which walk straightway to the temples,? making repentance and supplicating the saints, and now suddenly you are to remain unmoved. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O head, hands, and feet, till now I have held you fast. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O soul, what placed you in the humble and wretched body? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Yet now, separated from it, you ascend where the Lord calls you and the wretched body goes away for judgment. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  O beautiful body, hair shed by the stars, head like heaven adorned. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O face sweet-smelling, eyes like windows, a voice like a bugle’s sound, a tongue which talks so easily, a beard well trimmed, hair like the stars, head high as heaven, a body adorned, the illuminator elegant and renowned, yet now after falling within the earth, your beauty beneath the earth is unseen.” </p>
