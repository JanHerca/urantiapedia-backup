<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Sedrach said to him, “You, Master, created man; you know the low state of his will and his knowledge? and you send man into punishment on a false pretext; so remove him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Am I alone supposed to fill the celestial realms? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If that is not so, Lord, save man also. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pitiful man has transgressed by your will, O Lord.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “Why do you throw words around me as if they were a net, Sedrach? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I created Adam and his wife and the sun and I said, ‘Look at each other (to see) who is illuminated.’ </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the sun and Adam were of one character, but the wife of Adam was brighter than the moon in beauty, and she gave life to her.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sedrach said, “What is the use of beautiful things if they wither away to dust? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  How is it that you said, Lord, ‘Do not repay evil for evil’? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  How is it, Master, for the word of your divinity never lies? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And why did you thus repay man, if you do not wish (to return) evil for evil? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I know that among the four-footed beasts the mule is a crafty animal, it is none other; yet, with the bridle we turn it where we wish. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  You have angels; send them to watch (over man) and when he makes a move </p>
