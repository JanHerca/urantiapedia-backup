<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and desiring to be fed with the [crumbs] that fell from the rich man's table; yea, even the dogs come and licked his sores. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us. <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead. </p>
