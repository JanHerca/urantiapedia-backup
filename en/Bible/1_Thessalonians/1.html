<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention [of you] in our prayers; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and [in] much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come. </p>
