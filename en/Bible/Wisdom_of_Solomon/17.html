<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from the eternal providence. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness. </p>
