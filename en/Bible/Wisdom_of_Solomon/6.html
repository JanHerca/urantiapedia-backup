<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And incorruption maketh us near unto God: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good. </p>
