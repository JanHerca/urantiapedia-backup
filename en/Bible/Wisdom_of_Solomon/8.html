<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said, </p>
