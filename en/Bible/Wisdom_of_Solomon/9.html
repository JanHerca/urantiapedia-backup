<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom. </p>
