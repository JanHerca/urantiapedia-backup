<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly. </p>
