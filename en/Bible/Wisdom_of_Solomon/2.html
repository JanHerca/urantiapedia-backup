<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He was made to reprove our thoughts. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it. </p>
