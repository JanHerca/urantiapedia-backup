<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  (For righteousness is immortal:) </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it. </p>
