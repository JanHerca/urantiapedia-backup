<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing. </p>
