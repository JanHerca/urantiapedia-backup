<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation. </p>
