<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But [it is] not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac— </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  for [the children] being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  [even] us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And it shall be, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  for the Lord will execute [his] word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at [that] law. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling; </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
