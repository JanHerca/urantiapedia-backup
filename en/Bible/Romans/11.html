<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  if by any means I may provoke to jealousy [them that are] my flesh, and may save some of them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For if the casting away of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural [branches], be grafted into their own olive tree? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him [be] the glory for ever. Amen. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
