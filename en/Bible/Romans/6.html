<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For if we have become united with [him] in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  for he that hath died is justified from sin. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  neither present your members unto sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves [as] servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members [as] servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members [as] servants to righteousness unto sanctification. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
