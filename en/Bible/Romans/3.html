<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.) </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Their feet are swift to shed blood; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Destruction and misery are in their ways; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And the way of peace have they not known: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There is no fear of God before their eyes. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law [cometh] the knowledge of sin. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  whom God set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God; <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  for the showing, [I say], of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Or is God [the God] of Jews only? is he not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also: </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law. </p>
