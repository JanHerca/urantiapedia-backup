<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he]. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? <sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. <sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? <sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and [yet] he opened mine eyes. <sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. <sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind. <sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth. <sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup></p>
