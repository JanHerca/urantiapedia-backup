<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and [he will set some] to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us, </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. </p>
