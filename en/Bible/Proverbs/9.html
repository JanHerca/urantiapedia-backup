<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man [getteth] himself a blot. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Give [instruction] to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The foolish woman is clamorous; [She is] simple, and knoweth nothing. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Stolen waters are sweet, And bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol. </p>
