<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear, [my] sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil. </p>
