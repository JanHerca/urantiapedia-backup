<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] his own life. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Counsel in the heart of man is [like] deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Love not sleep, let thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, [and] thou shalt be satisfied with bread. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [that is surety] for foreigners. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  An inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  A man's goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  It is a snare to a man rashly to say, [It is] holy, And after vows to make inquiry. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the [threshing] -wheel over them. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes [reach] the innermost parts. </p>
