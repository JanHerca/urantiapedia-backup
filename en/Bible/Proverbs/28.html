<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are bold as a lion. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is [like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek Jehovah understand all things. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in [his] ways, though he be rich. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the perfect shall inherit good. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, [So is] a wicked ruler over a poor people. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; [But] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; But he that is perverse in [his] ways shall fall at once. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  he that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor Than he that flattereth with the tongue. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, The same is the companion of a destroyer. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase. </p>
