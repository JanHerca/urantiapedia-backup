<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When a wicked man dieth, [his] expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked cometh in his stead. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness [hath] a sure reward. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He that is stedfast in righteousness [shall attain] unto life; And he that pursueth evil [doeth it] to his own death. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in [their] way are his delight. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  [Though] hand [join] in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  [As] a ring of gold in a swine's snout, [So is] a fair woman that is without discretion. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The desire of the righteous is only good; [But] the expectation of the wicked is wrath. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it tendeth] only to want. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner! </p>
