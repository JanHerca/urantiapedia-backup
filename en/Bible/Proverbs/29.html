<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice; But when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth [his] substance. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The king by justice establisheth the land; But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A man that flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his steps. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; But the righteous doth sing and rejoice. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked hath not understanding to know [it]. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect; And as for the upright, they seek his life. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  A fool uttereth all his anger; But a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, All his servants are wicked. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The poor man and the oppressor meet together; Jehovah lighteneth the eyes of them both. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, His throne shall be established for ever. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth; But the righteous shall look upon their fall. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; Yea, he will give delight unto thy soul. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A servant will not be corrected by words; For though he understand, he will not give heed. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child Shall have him become a son at the last. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  An angry man stirreth up strife, And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A man's pride shall bring him low; But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Many seek the ruler's favor; But a man's judgment [cometh] from Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked. </p>
