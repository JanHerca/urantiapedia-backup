<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding [thy] kinswoman: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So she caught him, and kissed him, [And] with an impudent face she said unto him: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death. </p>
