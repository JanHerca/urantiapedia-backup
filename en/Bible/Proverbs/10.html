<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; [But] he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The rich man's wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The labor of the righteous [tendeth] to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The tongue of the righteous is [as] choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And [so is] wisdom to a man of understanding. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The hope of the righteous [shall be] gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked [speaketh] perverseness. </p>
