<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: [Though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not be unpunished. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When a man's ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A man's heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  A just balance and scales are Jehovah's; All the weights of the bag are his work. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The wrath of a king is [as] messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  In the light of the king's countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Pride [goeth] before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is [their] folly. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Pleasant words are [as] a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him [thereto]. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  He that shutteth his eyes, [it is] to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
