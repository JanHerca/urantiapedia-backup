<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee; <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For [riches] certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Withhold not correction from the child; [For] if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Let not thy heart envy sinners; But [be thou] in the fear of Jehovah all the day long: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Buy the truth, and sell it not; [Yea], wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly: </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  They have stricken me, [shalt thou say], and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. </p>
