<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A wise son [heareth] his father's instruction; But a scoffer heareth not rebuke. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth; But the soul of the treacherous [shall eat] violence. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life; [But] he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A righteous man hateth lying; But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The ransom of a man's life is his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth by labor shall have increase. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Good understanding giveth favor; But the way of the transgressor is hard. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Every prudent man worketh with knowledge; But a fool flaunteth [his] folly. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  A wicked messenger falleth into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Poverty and shame [shall be to] him that refuseth correction; But he that regardeth reproof shall be honored. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise; But the companion of fools shall smart for it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Evil pursueth sinners; But the righteous shall be recompensed with good. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Much food [is in] the tillage of the poor; But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked shall want. </p>
