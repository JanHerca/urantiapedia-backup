<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for [his] pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and [findeth it] not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive [in him] the lips of knowledge. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth [shall be to] them that devise good. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips [tendeth] only to penury. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The crown of the wise is their riches; [But] the folly of fools is [only] folly. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies [causeth] deceit. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  In the multitude of people is the king's glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But [that which is] in the inward part of fools is made known. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  The king's favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be [against] him that causeth shame. </p>
