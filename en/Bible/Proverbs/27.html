<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Boast not thyself of tomorrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool's vexation is heavier than they both. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man's friend [that cometh] of hearty counsel. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; And go not to thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that reproacheth me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  A prudent man seeth the evil, [and] hideth himself; [But] the simple pass on, [and] suffer for it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [that is surety] for a foreign woman. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He that would restrain her restraineth the wind; And his right hand encountereth oil. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that regardeth his master shall be honored. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  As in water face [answereth] to face, So the heart of man to man. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is [tried] by his praise. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, [And] look well to thy herds: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For riches are not for ever: And doth the crown endure unto all generations? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The lambs are for thy clothing, And the goats are the price of the field; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And [there will be] goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, And maintenance for thy maidens. </p>
