<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Jehovah trieth the hearts. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; [And] a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; [And] he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Children's children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Excellent speech becometh not a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  A bribe is [as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The beginning of strife is [as] when one letteth out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  A friend loveth at all times; And a brother is born for adversity. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  A man void of understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He loveth transgression that loveth strife: He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow; And the father of a fool hath no joy. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bare him. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Also to punish the righteous is not good, [Nor] to smite the noble for [their] uprightness. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; When he shutteth his lips, he is [esteemed as] prudent. </p>
