<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner's tongue. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For on account of a harlot [a man is brought] to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. </p>
