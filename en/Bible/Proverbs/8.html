<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge [and] discretion. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  By me kings reign, And princes decree justice. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  By me princes rule, And nobles, [even] all the judges of the earth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Riches and honor are with me; [Yea], durable wealth and righteousness. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep, </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Then I was by him, [as] a master workman; And I was daily [his] delight, Rejoicing always before him, </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
