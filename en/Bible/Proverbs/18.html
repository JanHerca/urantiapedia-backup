<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  He that separateth himself seeketh [his own] desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy [cometh] reproach. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The words of a man's mouth are [as] deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is [as] a flowing brook. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To respect the person of the wicked is not good, [Nor] to turn aside the righteous in judgment. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor [goeth] humility. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A man's gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He that pleadeth his cause first [seemeth] just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city; And [such] contentions are like the bars of a castle. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  A man's belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He that maketh many friends [doeth it] to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
