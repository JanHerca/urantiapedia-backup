<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But what can I help you? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God. </p>
