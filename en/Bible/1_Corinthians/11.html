<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  for this cause ought the woman to have [a sign of] authority on her head, because of the angels. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  for in your eating each one taketh before [other] his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come. </p>
