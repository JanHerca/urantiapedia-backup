<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all [his] will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let all that ye do be done in love. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints), </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. </p>
