<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye know that when ye were Gentiles [ye were] led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the body is not one member, but many. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And if they were all one member, where were the body? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But now they are many members, but one body. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [divers] kinds of tongues. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all [workers of] miracles? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you. </p>
