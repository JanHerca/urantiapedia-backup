<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you] hath his father's wife. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, [even] Christ: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves. </p>
