<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But unto the married I give charge, [yea] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  (but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us in peace. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use [it] rather. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. </p>
