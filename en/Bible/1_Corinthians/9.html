<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My defence to them that examine me is this. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Have we no right to eat and to drink? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, [to thresh] in hope of partaking. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  If others partake of [this] right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For though I was free from all [men,] I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And I do all things for the gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected. </p>
