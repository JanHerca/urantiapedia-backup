<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and did all eat the same spiritual food; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Let no man seek his own, but [each] his neighbor's [good]. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  If one of them that believe not biddeth you [to a feast], and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of the many, that they may be saved. </p>
