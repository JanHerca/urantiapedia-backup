<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis [shall have] adversaries in the day-time. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these [cities] shall go into captivity. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm], and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
