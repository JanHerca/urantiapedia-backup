<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  that say, [The time] is not near to build houses: this [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are they] unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me. </p>
