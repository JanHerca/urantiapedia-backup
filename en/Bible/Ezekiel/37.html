<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. </p>
