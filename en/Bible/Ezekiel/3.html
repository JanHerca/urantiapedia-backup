<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. </p>
