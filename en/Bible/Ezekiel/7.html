<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, upon the mountains. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret [place]; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
