<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. </p>
