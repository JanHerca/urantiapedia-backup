<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court [reached] unto the posts, round about the gate. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon [each] post were palm-trees. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And there was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures; </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures; </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And on the [one] side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [the sacrifices]. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house; </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. </p>
