<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. </p>
