<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [Or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather [the grain] of thy threshing-floor? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; [But] are they the pinions and plumage of love? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, [she is] without fear; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Hast thou given the horse [his] might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  As oft as the trumpet [soundeth] he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south? </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high? </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she. </p>
