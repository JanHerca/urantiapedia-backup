<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They are driven forth from the midst [of men]; They cry after them as after a thief; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  [They are] children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, [Even] men that have no helper. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves [upon me]. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the [pains] that gnaw me take no rest. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  By [God's] great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride [upon it]; And thou dissolvest me in the storm. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  My skin is black, [and falleth] from me, And my bones are burned with heat. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Therefore is my harp [turned] to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep. </p>
