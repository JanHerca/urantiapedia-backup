<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  My soul refuseth to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for! </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To him that is ready to faint kindness [should be showed] from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Which are black by reason of the ice, [And] wherein the snow hideth itself: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind? </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Yea, ye would cast [lots] upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things? </p>
