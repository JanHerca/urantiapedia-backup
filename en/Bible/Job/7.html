<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than [these] my bones. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I loathe [my life]; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be. </p>
