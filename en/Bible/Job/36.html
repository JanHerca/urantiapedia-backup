<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Elihu also proceeded, and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted [their] right. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If they hearken and serve [him], They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  They die in youth, And their life [perisheth] among the unclean. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold [on thee]. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Will thy cry avail, [that thou be] not in distress, Or all the forces of [thy] strength? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor, </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning [the storm] that cometh up. </p>
