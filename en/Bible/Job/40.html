<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Job answered Jehovah, and said, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Look on every one that is proud, [and] bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden [place]. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  His bones are [as] tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He is the chief of the ways of God: He [only] that made him giveth him his sword. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare? </p>
