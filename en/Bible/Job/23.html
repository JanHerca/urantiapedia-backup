<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat! <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Behold, I go forward, but he is not [there]; And backward, but I cannot perceive him; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But he is in one [mind], and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face. </p>
