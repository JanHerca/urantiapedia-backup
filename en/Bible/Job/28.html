<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [Man] setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
