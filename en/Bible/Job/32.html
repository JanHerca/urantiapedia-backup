<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For I know not to give flattering titles; [Else] would my Maker soon take me away. </p>
