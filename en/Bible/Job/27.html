<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Job again took up his parable, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils); </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I live. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered [to his fathers]; He openeth his eyes, and he is not. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For [God] shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place. </p>
