<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?- <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [Him] that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Behold, he seizeth [the prey], who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words [to reason] with him? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  If [we speak] of strength, lo, [he is] mighty! And if of justice, Who, [saith he], will summon me? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If [it be] not [he], who then is it? </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my [sad] countenance, and be of good cheer; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain? </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean; </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid: </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself. </p>
