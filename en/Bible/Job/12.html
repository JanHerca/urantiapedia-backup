<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly]. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  With [God] is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. </p>
