<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not [the lightnings] when his voice is heard. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know [it]. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Out of the chamber [of the south] cometh the storm, And cold out of the north. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Dost thou know how God layeth [his charge] upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south [wind]? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Teach us what we shall say unto him; [For] we cannot set [our speech] in order by reason of darkness. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  [Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart. </p>
