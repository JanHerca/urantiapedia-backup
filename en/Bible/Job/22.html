<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Is it for thy fear [of him] that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn, </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  [Saying], Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And lay thou [thy] treasure in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  When they cast [thee] down, thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; And the humble person he will save. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  He will deliver [even] him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands. </p>
