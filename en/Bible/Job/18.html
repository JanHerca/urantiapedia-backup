<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [And] are become unclean in your sight? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A gin shall take [him] by the heel, [And] a snare shall lay hold on him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The members of his body shall be devoured, [Yea], the first-born of death shall devour his members. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God. </p>
