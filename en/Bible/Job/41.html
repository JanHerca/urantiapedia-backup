<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [His] strong scales are [his] pride, Shut up together [as with] a close seal. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  One is so near to another, That no air can come between them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He counteth iron as straw, [And] brass as rotten wood. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds: He spreadeth [as it were] a threshing-wain upon the mire. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride. </p>
