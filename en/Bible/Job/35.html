<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Moreover Elihu answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thinkest thou this to be [thy] right, [Or] sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? [And], What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou art; And thy righteousness [may profit] a son of man. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Surely God will not hear an empty [cry], Neither will the Almighty regard it. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge. </p>
