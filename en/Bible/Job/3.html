<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Job answered and said: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother's] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in? </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh. </p>
