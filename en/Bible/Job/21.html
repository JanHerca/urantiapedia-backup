<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Job answered and said, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  [Ye say], God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off? </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences, </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath? </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done? </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth [only] falsehood? </p>
