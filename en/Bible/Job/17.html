<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is [ready] for me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt [them]. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They change the night into day: The light, [say they], is near unto the darkness. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it? </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust. </p>
