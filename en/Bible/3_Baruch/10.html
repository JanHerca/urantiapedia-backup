<p> <i>The Fourth Heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when I had learnt all these things from the archangel, he took and led me into a fourth </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  heaven. And I saw a monotonous plain, and in the middle of it a pool of water. And there were in it multitudes of birds of all kinds, but not like those here on earth. But I saw a crane as great as </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  great oxen; and all the birds were great beyond those in the world. And I asked the angel, What </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  is the plain, and what the pool, and what the multitudes of birds around it And the angel said, Listen, Baruch : The plain which contains in it the pool and other wonders is the place where the </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  souls of the righteous come, when they hold converse, living together in choirs. But the water is </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  that which the clouds receive, and rain upon the earth, and the fruits increase. And I said again to the angel of the Lord, But (what) are these birds And he said to me, They are those which </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  continually sing praise to the Lord. And I said, Lord, and how do men say that the water which </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  descends in rain is from the sea And the angel said, The water which descends in rain-this also is from the sea, and from the waters upon earth; but that which stimulates the fruits is (only) from </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  the latter source. Know therefore henceforth that from this source is what is called the dew of heaven. </p>
