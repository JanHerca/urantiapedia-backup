<p> <i>Prologue</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Verily I Baruch was weeping in my mind and sorrowing on account of the people, and that </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Nebuchadnezzar the king was permitted by God to destroy His city, saying: Lord, why didst Thou set on fire Thy vineyard, and lay it waste Why didst Thou do this And why, Lord, didst Thou not requite us with another chastisement, but didst deliver us to nations such as these, so that they </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  reproach us and say, Where is their God And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem, for thus saith the Lord God, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  the Almighty. For He sent me before thee, to make known and to show to thee all (the things) </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  of God. For thy prayer was heard before Him, and entered into the ears of the Lord God. And when he had said these things to me, I was silent. And the angel said to me: Cease to provoke </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  God, and I will show thee other mysteries, greater than these. And I Baruch said, As the Lord God liveth, if thou wilt show me, and I hear a word of thine, I will not continue to speak any longer. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  God shall add to my judgement in the day of judgement, if I speak hereafter. And the angel of the powers said to me, Come, and I will show thee the mysteries of God. </p>
