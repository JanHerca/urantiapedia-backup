<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And then came in like manner other angels weeping and bewailing, and saying with fear, Behold how we are overclouded, O Lord, for we were delivered to evil men, and we wish to depart from </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  them. And Michael said, Ye cannot depart from them, in order that the enemy may not prevail to </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  the end; but say to me what ye ask. And they said, We pray thee, Michael our commander, transfer us from them, for we cannot abide with wicked and foolish men, for there is nothing good </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  in them, but every kind of unrighteousness and greed. For we do not behold them entering [into Church at all, nor among spiritual fathers, nor] into any good work. But where there is murder, there also are they in the midst, and where are fornications, adulteries, thefts, slanders, perjuries, jealousies, drunkenness, strife, envy, murmurings, whispering, idolatry, divination, and such like, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  then are they workers of such works, and of others worse. Wherefore we entreat that we may depart from them. And Michael said to the angels, Wait till I learn from the Lord what shall come to pass. </p>
