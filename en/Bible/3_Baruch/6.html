<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he took me and led me where the sun goes forth; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and he showed me a chariot and four, under which burnt a fire, and in the chariot was sitting a man, wearing a crown of fire, (and) the chariot (was) drawn by forty angels. And behold a bird circling before the sun, about nine </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  cubits away. And I said to the angel, What is this bird And he said to me, This is the </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  guardian of the earth. And I said, Lord, how is he the guardian of the earth Teach me. And the angel said to me, This bird flies alongside of the sun, and expanding his wings receives its fiery </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  rays. For if he were not receiving them, the human race would not be preserved, nor any other </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  living creature. But God appointed this bird thereto. And he expanded his wings, and I saw on his right wing very large letters, as large as the space of a threshing-floor, the size of about four </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  thousand modii; and the letters were of gold. And the angel said to me, Read them. And I read </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and they ran thus: Neither earth nor heaven bring me forth, but wings of fire bring me forth. And I said, Lord, what is this bird, and what is his name And the angel said to me,  His name is called </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Phoenix. (And I said), And what does he eat And he said to me, The manna of heaven and </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  the dew of earth. And I said, Does the bird excrete And he said to me, He excretes a worm, and the excrement of the worm is cinnamon, which kings and princes use. But wait and thou shalt </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  see the glory of God. And while he was conversing with me, there was as a thunder-clap, and the place was shaken on which we were standing. And I asked the angel, My Lord, what is this sound And the angel said to me, Even now the angels are opening the three hundred and sixty-five gates </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  of heaven, and the light is being separated from the darkness. And a voice came which said, Light </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  giver, give to the world radiance. And when I heard the noise of the bird, I said, Lord, what is this </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  noise And he said, This is the bird who awakens from slumber the cocks upon earth. For as men do through the mouth, so also does the cock signify to those in the world, in his own speech. For the sun is made ready by the angels, and the cock crows. </p>
