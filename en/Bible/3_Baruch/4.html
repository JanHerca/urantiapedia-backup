<p> <i>The Third Heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I Baruch said, Behold, Lord, Thou didst show me great and wonderful things; and now </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  show me all things for the sake of the Lord. And the angel said to me, Come, let us proceed. (And I proceeded) with the angel from that place about one hundred and eighty-five days' </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  journey. And he showed me a plain and a serpent, which appeared to be two hundred plethra in length. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he showed me Hades, and its appearance was dark and abominable. And I said, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Who is this dragon, and who is this monster around him And the angel said, The dragon is he </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  who eats the bodies of those who spend their life wickedly, and he is nourished by them. And this is Hades, which itself also closely resembles him, in that it also drinks about a cubit from </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  the sea, which does not sink at all. Baruch said, And how (does this happen) And the angel said, Hearken, the Lord God made three hundred and sixty rivers, of which the chief of </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  all are Alphias, Abyrus, and the Gericus; and because of these the sea does not sink. And I said, I pray thee show me which is the tree which led Adam astray. And the angel said to me, It is the vine, which the angel Sammael planted, whereat the Lord God was angry, and He cursed him and his plant, while also on this account He did not permit Adam to touch it, and therefore </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  the devil being envious deceived him through his vine. [And I Baruch said, Since also the vine has been the cause of such great evil, and is under judgment of the curse of God, and was the </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  destruction of the first created, how is it now so useful And the angel said, Thou askest aright. When God caused the deluge upon earth, and destroyed all flesh, and four hundred and nine thousand giants, and the water rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, then the water entered into paradise and destroyed every flower; but it removed wholly without the bounds the shoot </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  of the vine and cast it outside. And when the earth appeared out of the water, and Noah came out </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  of the ark, he began to plant of the plants which he found. But he found also the shoot of the vine; and he took it, and was reasoning in himself, What then is it And I came and spake to </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  him the things concerning it. And he said, Shall I plant it, or what shall I do Since Adam was destroyed because of it, let me not also meet with the anger of God because of it. And saying </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  these things he prayed that God would reveal to him what he should do concerning it. And when he had completed the prayer which lasted forty days, and having besought many things and wept, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  he said: Lord, I entreat thee to reveal to me what I shall do concerning this plant. But God sent his angel Sarasael, and said to him, Arise, Noah, and plant the shoot of the vine, for thus saith the Lord : Its bitterness shall be changed into sweetness, and its curse shall become a blessing, and that which is produced from it shall become the blood of God; and as through it the human race obtained condemnation, so again through Jesus Christ the Immanuel will they receive in Him the </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  upward calling, and the entry into paradise]. Know therefore, O Baruch, that as Adam through this very tree obtained condemnation, and was divested of the glory of God, so also the men who now drink insatiably the wine which is begotten of it, transgress worse than Adam, and are far from the </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  glory of God, and are surrendering themselves to the eternal fire. For (no) good comes through it. For those who drink it to surfeit do these things: neither does a brother pity his brother, nor a father his son, nor children their parents, but from the drinking of wine come all evils, such as murders, adulteries, fornications, perjuries, thefts, and such like. And nothing good is established by it. </p>
