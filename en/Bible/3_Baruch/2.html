<p> <i>The First Heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he took me and led me where the firmament has been set fast, and where there was a river which no one can cross, nor any strange breeze of all those which God created. And he took me and led me to the first heaven, and showed me a door of great size. And he said to me, Let us enter </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  through it, and we entered as though borne on wings, a distance of about thirty days' journey. And he showed me within the heaven a plain ; and there were men dwelling thereon, with the faces of </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  oxen, and the horns of stags and the feet of goats, and the haunches of lambs. And I Baruch asked the angel, Make known to me, I pray thee, what is the thickness of the heaven in which we journeyed, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  or what is its extent, or what is the plain, in order that I may also tell the sons of men And the angel whose name is Phamael said to me: This door which thou seest is the door of heaven, and as great as is the distance from earth to heaven, so great also is its thickness; and again as great as is the distance (from North to South, so great) is the length of the plain which thou didst see. And again the angel of the powers said to me, Come, and I will show thee greater mysteries. But </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>   I said, I pray thee show me what are these men. And he said to me, These are they who built the tower of strife against God, and the Lord banished them. </p>
