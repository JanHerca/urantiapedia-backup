<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I said, And where does the sun begin its labors, after the cock crows </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the angel said to me, Listen, Baruch: All things whatsoever I showed thee are in the first and second heaven, and in the third heaven the sun passes through and gives light to the world. But wait, and thou </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  shalt see the glory of God. And while I was conversing with him, I saw the bird, and he appeared </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  in front, and grew less and less, and at length returned to his full size. And behind him I saw the shining sun, and the angels which draw it, and a crown upon its bead, the sight of which we were </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  not able to gaze Upon, and behold. And as soon as the sun shone, the Phoenix also stretched out his wings. But I, when I beheld such great glory, was brought low with great fear, and I fled and </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  hid in the wings of the angel. And the angel said to me, Fear not, Baruch, but wait and thou shalt also see their setting. </p>
