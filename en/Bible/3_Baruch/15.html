<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And in that very hour Michael descended, and the gate was opened; and he brought oil. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And as for the angels which brought the baskets which were full, he filled them with oil, saying, Take it away, reward our friends an hundredfold, and those who have laboriously wrought good works. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For those who sowed virtuously, also reap virtuously. And he said also to those bringing the half-empty baskets, Come hither ye also; take away the reward according as ye brought, and </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  deliver it to the sons of men. [Then he said also to those who brought the full and to those who brought the half-empty baskets: Go and bless our friends, and say to them that thus saith the Lord, Ye are faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord.] </p>
