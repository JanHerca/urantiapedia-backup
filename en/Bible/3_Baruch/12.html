<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And as I was conversing with them, behold angels came bearing baskets full of flowers. And </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  they gave them to Michael. And I asked the angel, Lord, who are these, and what are the things </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  brought hither from beside them And he said to me, These are angels (who) are over the </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  righteous. And the archangel took the baskets, and cast them into the vessel. And the angel </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  said to me, These flowers are the merits of the righteous. And I saw other angels bearing baskets which were (neither) empty-nor full. And they began to lament, and did not venture to draw near, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  because they had not the prizes complete. And Michael cried and said, Come hither, also, ye </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  angels, bring what ye have brought. And Michael was exceedingly grieved, and the angel who was with me, because they did not fill the vessel. </p>
