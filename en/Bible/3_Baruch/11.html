<p> <i>The Fifth Heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the angel took me and led me thence to a fifth heaven. And the gate was closed. And I said, Lord, is not this gate-way open that we may enter And the angel said to me, We cannot enter until Michael comes, who holds the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; but wait and thou shalt see </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [...] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  the glory of God. And there was a great sound, as thunder. And I said, Lord, what is this sound </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he said to me, Even now Michael, the commander of the angels, comes down to receive the </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  prayers of men. And behold a voice came, Let the gates be opened. And they opened them, and </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  there was a roar as of thunder. And Michael came, and the angel who was with me came face to </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  face with him and said, Hail, my commander, and that of all our order. And the commander Michael said, Hail thou also, our brother, and the interpreter of the revelations to those who pass through life </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  virtuously. And having saluted one another thus, they stood still. And I saw the commander Michael, holding an exceedingly great vessel; its depth was as great as the distance from heaven to </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  earth, and its breadth as great as the distance from north to south. And I said, Lord, what is that which Michael the archangel is holding And he said to me, This is where the merits of the righteous enter, and such good works as they do, which are escorted before the heavenly God. </p>
