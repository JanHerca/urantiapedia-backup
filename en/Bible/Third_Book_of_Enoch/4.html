<p> <i>Metatron is identical with Enoch who was translated to heaven at the time of the Deluge</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: I asked Metatron and said to him: “Why art thou called by the name of thy Creator, by seventy names? Thou art greater than all the princes, higher than all the angels, beloved more than all the servants, honoured above all the mighty ones in kingship, greatness and glory: why do they call thee ‘Youth’ in the high heavens?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He answered and said to me; “Because I am Enoch, the son of Jared. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For when the generation of the flood sinned and were confounded in their deeds, saying unto God: ‘Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways’ then the Holy One, blessed be He, removed me from their midst to be a witness against them in the high heavens to all the inhabitants of the world, that they may not say: ‘The Merciful One is cruel’. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [ADEL:] What sinned all those multitudes, their wives, their sons and their daughters, their horses, their mules and their cattle and their property, and all the birds of the world, all of which the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed from the world together with them in the waters of the flood? Nor may say: ‘What though the generation of the flood did sin; the beasts and the birds, what had they sinned, that they should perish with them?’ [BC:] ‘What sins had they committed, all those multitudes? Or, let it be they sinned, what had their sons and their daughters, their mules and their cattle sinned? And likewise, all the animals, domestic and wild, and the birds in the world that God did destroy from the world?’ </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, lifted me upin their lifetime before their eyes to be a witness against them to the future world. And the Holy One, blessed be He, assigned me for a prince and a ruler among the ministering angels. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In that hour three of the ministering angels, 'uzza, 'azza and 'azzael came forth and brought charges against me in the high heavens, saying before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Said not the Ancient Ones (First Ones) rightly before Thee: ‘Do not create man!,’ The Holy One, blessed be He, answered and said unto them: “I have made and I will bear, yea, I will carry and will deliver”. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As soon as they saw me, they said before Him: “Lord of the Universe ! What is this one that he should ascend to the height of heights? Is not he one from among the sons of [the sons of] those who perished in the days of the Flood? ‘What doeth he in the Raqia’?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Again, the Holy One, blessed be He, answered and said to them: “What are ye, that ye enter and speak in my presence? I de- light in this one more than in all of you, and hence he shall be a prince and a ruler over you in the high heavens.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Forthwith all stood up and went out to meet me, prostrated themselves before me and said: “Happy art thou and happy is thy father for thy Creator doth favour thee”. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And because I am small and a youth among them in days, months and years, therefore they call me “Youth” (Na'ar). </p>
