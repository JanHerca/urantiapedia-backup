<p> <i>The princes of the seven heavens, of the sun y moon, planets and constellations and their suites of angels</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the Prince of the Presence, the glory of all heavens, said to me: Seven (are the) princes, the great, beautiful, revered, wonderful and honoured ones who are appointed over the seven heavens. And these are they: [A: MIKAEL, GABRIEL, SHATQIEL, SHACHAQIEL, BAKARIEL, BADARIEL, PACHRIEL.] [D: MIKAEL and GABRIEL, SHATQIEL and BARADIEL and SHACHAQIEL and BARAQIEL and SIDRIEL. ] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And every one of them is the prince of the host of (one) heaven. And each one of them is accompanied by 496,000 myriads of ministering angels. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Mikael, the great prince, is appointed over the seventh heaven, the highest one, which is in the 'Araboth. </p>
<p> Gabriel, the prince of the host, is appointed over the sixth heaven which is in Makon. </p>
<p> Shataqiel, prince of the host, is appointed over the fifth heaven which is in Ma'on. </p>
<p> Shahaqi'el, prince of the host, is appointed over the fourth heaven which is in Zebul. </p>
<p> Badariel, prince of the host, is appointed over the third heaven which is in Shehaqim. </p>
<p> Barakiel, prince of the host, is appointed over the second heaven which is in the height of (Merom) Raqia. </p>
<p> Pazriel, prince of the host, is appointed over the first heaven which is in Wilon, which is in Shamayim. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Under them is Galgalliel, the prince who is appointed over the globe (galgal) of the sun, and with him aregreat and honoured angels who move the sun in Raqia. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Under them is 'Ophanniel, the prince who is set over the globe ('ophan) of the moon. And with him are angels who move the globe of the moon thousand parasangs every night at the time when the moon stands in the East at its turning point. And when is the moon sitting in the East at its turning point? Answer: in the fifteenth day of every month. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Under them is Rahatiel, the prince who is appointed over the constellations. And he is accompanied by 72 great and honoured angels. And why is he called Rahatiel? Because he makes the stars run (marhit) in their orbits and courses 339 thousand parasangs every night from the East to the West, and from the West to the East. For the Holy One, blessed be He, has made a tent for all of them, for the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars in which they travel at night from the West to the East. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Under them is Kokbiel, the prince who is appointed over all the planets. And with him are 365,000 myriads of ministering angels, great and honoured ones who movethe planets from city to city and from province to province in the Raqia of heavens. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And over them are seventy-two princes of kingdoms on high corresponding to the tongues of the world. And all of them are crowned with royal crowns and clad in royal garments and wrapped in royal cloaks. And all of them are riding on royal horses and they are holding royal sceptres in their hands. And before each one of them when he is travelling in Raqia, royal servants are running with great glory and majesty [A: even as on earth they (princes) are travelling in chariot (s) with horsemen and great armies and in glory and greatness with praise, song and honour. ] [D: and before every one of them, when travelling in Raqia', there are running great armies, even as (the custom is) on earth, with chariot(s), in glory and greatness, praise, song and honour. ] </p>
