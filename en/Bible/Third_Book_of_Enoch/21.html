<p> <i>The Chayyoth</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Four (are) the Chayyoth corresponding to the four winds. Each Chayya is as the space of the whole world. And each one has four faces ; and each face is as the face of the East. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Each one has four wings and each wing is like the cover (roof) of the universe. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And each one has faces in the middle of faces and wings in the middle of wings. The size of the faces is (as the size of) faces, and the size of the wings is (as the size of) wings. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And every one is crowned withcrowns on his head. And each crown is like unto the bow in the cloud. And its splendour is like unto the splendour of the globe of the sun. And the sparks that go forth from every one are like the splendour of the morning star (planet Venus) in the East. </p>
