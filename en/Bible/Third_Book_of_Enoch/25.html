<p> <i>'Ophphanniel y the prince of the 'Ophannirn. Description of the 'Ophannim</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Above these there is one great prince, revered, high, lordly, fearful, ancient and strong, 'ophphanniel H' is his name. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He has sixteen faces, four faces on each side,(also) hundred wings on each side. And he haseyes, corresponding to the days of the year. [A: 2190 — and some say 2116 — on each side.] [DE: 2191 (E:196) and sixteen on each side. ] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And those two eyes of his face, in each one of them lightnings are flashing, and from each one of them firebrands are burning; and no creature is ableto behold them: for anyone who looks at them is burnt instantly. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  His height is (as) the distance of years' journey. No eye can behold and no mouth can tell the mighty power of his strength save the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, alone. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Why is he called 'Ophphanniel? </p>
<p> Because he is appointed over the 'Ophannim and the 'Ophannim are given in his charge.He standsevery day and attends and beautifiesthem. And he exalts and orders their apartment (DE: runnings) andpolishes their standing-placeand makes bright their dwellings, makes their corners evenand cleanses their seats. And he waits upon them early and late, by day and by night, to increase their beauty, to make great their dignity and to make them diligent in praise of their Creator. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And all the 'Ophannim are full of eyes,and they are all full of brightness;seventy two sapphire stones are fixed on their garments on their right sideand seventy two sapphire stones are fixed on their garments on their left side. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And four carbuncle stones are fixed on the crown of every single one, the splendour of which proceeds in the four directions of 'Araboth even as the splendour of the globe of the sun proceeds in all the directions of the universe.And why is it called Carbuncle (Bareqet)? Because its splendour is like the appearance of a lightning (Baraq). And tents of splendour, tents of brilliance, tents of brightness as of sapphire and carbuncle inclose them because of the shining appearance of their eyes. </p>
