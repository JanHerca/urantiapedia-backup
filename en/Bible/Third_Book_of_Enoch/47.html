<p> <i>Metatron shows R. Ishmael the spirits of the punished angels</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: Come and I will show thee the souls x of the angelsand the spirits ofthe ministering servantswhose bodieshave been burnt in the fire of MAQOM (the Almighty) that goes forth from his little finger. And they have been made into fiery coals in the midst of the fiery river (Nehar di-Nur). But their spirits and their souls are standing behind the Shekina. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whenever the ministering angels utter a song at a wrong time or as not appointedto be sung5 they are burntand consumed by the fire of their Creator and by a flame from their Maker, [A: in the places (chambers) of the whirlwind, for it blows upon them and drives them] [E: in their place (= on the spot) ; and  a whirlwind blows upon them and  throws them down  ] into the Nehar di-Nur; and there they are made into numerous mountains of burning coal. But their spirit and their soul return to their Creator, and all are standing behind their Master. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I wentby his sideand he took me by his hand ; and he showed me all the souls of the angels and the spirits of the ministering servants who were standing behind the Shekinaupon wings of the whirlwindand walls of fire surrounding them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  At that moment Metatron opened to me the gates of the walls within which they were standing behind the Shekina, And I lifted up my eyes and saw them, and behold, the likeness of every one was as (that of) angels and their wings like birds' (wings), made out of flames, the work of burning fire. In that moment I opened my mouth in praise of MAQOM and said: “How great are thy works, O Lord”. </p>
