<p> <i>INTRODUCTION: R. Ishmael ascends to heaven to behold the vision of the Merkaba and is given in charge to Metatron</i> </p>
<p> <i>AND ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD: AND HE WAS NOT ; FOR GOD TOOK HIM (Gen. v.4)</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Rabbi Ishmael said: When I ascended on high to behold the vision of the Merkaba and had entered the six Halls, one within the other: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  as soon as I reached the door of the seventh Hall I stood still in prayer before the Holy One, blessed be He, and, lifting up my eyes on high (i.e. towards the Divine Majesty), I said: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “Lord of the Universe, I pray thee, that the merit of Aaron, the son of Amram, the lover of peace and pursuer of peace, who received the crown of priesthood from Thy Glory on the mount of Sinai, be valid for me in this hour, so that Qafsiel, the prince, and the angels with him may not get power over me nor throw me down from the heavens”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, sent to me Metatron, his Servant ('Ebed) the angel, the Prince of the Presence, and he, spreading his wings, with great joy came to meet me so as to save me from their hand. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he took me by his hand in their sight, saying to me: “Enter in peace before the high and exalted King and behold the picture of the Merkaba”. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then I entered the seventh Hall, and he led me to the camp(s) of Shekina and placed me before the Holy One, blessed be He, to behold the Merkaba. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As soon as the princes of the Merkaba and the flaming Seraphim perceived me, they fixed their eyes upon me. Instantly trembling and shuddering seized me and I fell down and was benumbed by the radiant image of their eyes and the splendid appearance of their faces; until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them, saying: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “My servants, my Seraphim, my Kerubim and my f Ophannim! Cover ye your eyes before Ishmael, my son, my friend, my beloved one and my glory, that he tremble not nor shudder!” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Forthwith Metatron the Prince of the Presence, came and restored my spirit and put me upon my feet. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  After that (moment) there was not in me strength enough to say a song before the Throne of Glory of the glorious King, the mightiest of all kings, the most excellent of all princes, until after the hour had passed. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  After one hour (had passed) the Holy One, blessed be He, opened to me the gates of Shekina, the gates of Peace, the gates of Wisdom, the gates of Strength, the gates of Power, the gates of Speech (Dibbur)> the gates of Song, the gates of Qedushsha, the gates of Chant. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he enlightened my eyes and my heart by words of psalm, song, praise, exaltation, thanksgiving, extolment, glorification, hymn and eulogy. And as I opened my mouth, uttering a song before the Holy One, blessed be He, the Holy Chayyoth beneath and above the Throne of Glory answered and said: “holy” and “blessed be the glory of yhwh from his place!” (i.e. chanted the Qedushsha). </p>
