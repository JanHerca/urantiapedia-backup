<p> <i>The names of Metatron. The treasuries of Wisdom opened to Moses on mount Sinai. The angels protest against Metatron for revealing the secrets to Moses and are answered and rebuked by God. The chain of tradition and the power of the transmitted mysteries to heal diseases</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Seventy names has Metatron which the Holy One, blessed be He, took from his own name and put upon him. And these they are: </p>
<p> YeHOEL YaH, YeHOEL, YOPHIEL and Yophphiel, and 5 'APHPHIEL and MaRGeZIEL,GIPpUYEL, Pa'aZIEL, A'aH, PeRIEL, TaTRIEL, TaBKIEL, 'W, YHWH, DH WHYH,'eBeD, DiBbURIEL, 'aPH'aPIEL, SPPIEL, PaSPaSIEL, SeNeGRON, MeTaTRON, SOGDIN,'A- DRIGON, 'ASUM, SaQPaM, SaQTaM, MIGON, MITTON, MOTTRON, ROSPHIM, QINOTh,ChaTaTYaH, DeGaZYaH, PSPYaH, BSKNYH, MZRG, BaRaD, MKRKK, MSPRD, ChShG, ChShB, MNRTTT, BSYRYM, MITMON, TITMON, PiSQON, SaPhSaPhYaH, ZRCh, ZRChYaH, BeYaH, HBH BeYaH, PeLeT, PLTYaH, RaBRaBYaH, ChaS, ChaSYaH, TaPhTaPhYaH,TaMTaMYaH, SeHaSYaH, IR'URYaH, L'aLYaH, BaZRIDYaH, SaTSaTKYaH, SaSDYaH, RaZRaZYAH, BaZRaZYaH, aRIMYaH, SBHYaH, SBIBKHYH, StMKaM, YaHSeYaH,SSBIBYaH, SaBKaSBeYaH, QeLILQaLYaH, KIHHH, HHYH, ZoWH, WHYH, ZaKklKYaH, TUTRISYaH, SURYaH, ZeH, PeNIRHYaH, 'ZrH, GaL RaZaYYa, MaMLIKYaH, TTYaH, eMeQ, QaMYaH, MeKaPpeR YaH, PeRISHYaH, SePhaM, GBIR, GiBbORYaH, GOR, GOR YaH, ZIW, OKBaR, the LESSER YHWH, after the name of his Master, “for my name is in him”, RaBIBIEL, TUMIEL, Segansakkiel, the Prince of Wisdom. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And why is he called by the name Sagnesakiel? Because all the treasuries of wisdom are committedin his hand. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And all of them were opened to Moses on Sinai, so that he learnt them during the forty days, while he was standing (remaining): the Tor ah in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues,the Prophets in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Writings in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues,the Halakas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Traditions in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Haggadas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues and the Toseftas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But as soon as the forty days were ended, he forgot all of them in one moment. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, called Yephiphyah, the Prince of the Law, and (through him) they were given to Moses as a gift. As it is written: “and the Lord gave them unto me” . And after that it remained with him. And whence do we know, that it remained (in his memory)? Because it is written: “Remember ye the Law of Moses my servant12 zvhich I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even my statutes and judgements”. ‘The Law of Moses’: that is the Tor a, the Prophets and the Writings, ‘statutes’: that is the Halakas and Traditions, ‘judgements’; that is the Haggadas and the Toseftas. And all of them were givento Moses on high u on Sinai, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  These seventy names (are) a reflection of the Explicit Name(s) on the Merkaba which aregraven upon the Throne of Glory. For the Holy One, blessed be He, took from His Explicit Name(s) and put upon the name of Metatron: Seventy Names of His by which the ministering angels call the King of the kings of kings, blessed be He, in the high heavens, and twenty-two letters that are on the ring upon his finger with which are sealed the destinies of the princes of kingdoms on high in greatness and power and with which are sealed the lots of the Angel of Death, and the destinies of every nation and tongue. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  SaidMetatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence; the Angel, the Prince of the Wisdom; the Angel, the Prince of the Understanding; the Angel, the Prince of the Kings; the Angel, the Prince of the Rulers; the angel, the Prince of the Glory; the angel, the Princeof the high ones, and of the princes, the exalted, great and honoured ones, in heaven and on earth: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  H, God of Israel, is my witness in this thing, (that) when I revealed this secret to Moses, then all the hosts in every heaven on high raged against me and said to me: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Why dost thou reveal this secret to a son of man, born of woman, tainted and unclean, a man of a putrefying drop, the secret by which were created heaven and earth, the sea and the dry land, the mountains and hills, the rivers and springs, Gehenna of fire and hail, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life; and by which were formed Adam and Eve, and the cattle, and the wild beasts, and the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and Behemothand Leviathan, and the creeping things, the worms, the dragons of the sea, and the creeping things of the deserts; and the Tora and Wisdom and Knowledge and Thought and the Gnosis of things above and the fear of heaven. Why dost thou reveal this to flesh and blood? [A: Hast thou obtained authority from MAQOM? And again: Hast thou received permission? The Explicit Names went forth from before me] [FG: I answered them: Because the Holy One, blessed be He, has given me authority, And furthermore, I have obtained per- mission from the high and exalted Throne,  from which all the Explicit Names go  forth  ] with lightnings of fire and flaming chashmallim. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But they were not appeased, until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them and drove them away with rebuke from before him, saying to them: "I delight in, and have set my love on, and have entrusted and committed unto Metatron, my Servant, alone, for he is One (unique) among all the children of heaven. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Metatron brought them out from his house of treasuries and committed them to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets and the prophets to the men of the Great Synagogue, and the men of the Great Synagogue to Ezra and Ezra the Scribe to Hillel the elder, and Hillel the elder to R. Abbahu and R. Abbahu to R. Zera, and R. Zera to the men of faith, and the men of faith (committed them) to give warning and to heal by them all diseases that rage in the world, as it is written: “ If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord, thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord, that healeth thee”. (Ended and finished. Praise be unto the Creator of the World.) </p>
