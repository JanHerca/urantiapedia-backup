<p> <i>Rikbiel, the prince of the wheels of the Merkaba. The surroundings of the Merkaba. The commotion among the angelic hosts at the time of the Qedushsha</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Above these three angels, these great princes there is one Prince, distinguished, honoured, noble, glorified, adorned, fearful, valiant, strong, great, magnified, glorious, crowned, wonderful, exalted, blameless, beloved, lordly, high and lofty, ancient and mighty, like unto whom there is none among the princes. His name is Rikbiel H', the great and revered princewho is standing by the Merkaba. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And why is he called rikbiel? Because he is appointed over the wheels of the Merkaba, and they are given in his charge. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And how many are the wheels? Eight; two in each direction. And there are four winds compassing them round about. And these are their names: “the Storm-Wind”, “the Tempest”, “the Strong Wind”, and “the Wind of Earthquake”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And under them four fiery rivers are continually running, one fiery river on each side. And round about them, between the rivers, four clouds are planted (placed), and these they are: “clouds of fire”, “clouds of lamps”, “clouds of coal”, “clouds of brimstone” and they are standing over against [their] wheels. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the feet of the Chayyoth are resting upon the wheels. And between one wheel and the other earthquake is roaring and thunder is thundering. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when the time draws nigh for the recital of the Song, (then) the multitudes of wheels are moved, the multitude of clouds tremble, all the chieftains (shallishim) are made afraid, all the horsemen (parashim) do rage, all the mighty ones (gtbborim) are excited, all the hosts (seba'im) are afrighted, all the troops (gedudim)are in fear, all the appointed ones (memunnim) haste away, all the princes (sarim) and armies (chayyelim) are dismayed, all the servants (mesharetim) do faint and allthe angels (maVakim) and divisions (degalim) travail with pain. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And one wheel makes a sound to be heard to the other and one Kerub to another, one Chayya to another, one Seraph to another (saying) “Extol to him that rideth in 'Araboth, by his name Jah and rejoice before him!” </p>
