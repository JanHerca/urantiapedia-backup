<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron; the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: The hoofs of the Chayyoth are surrounded by seven clouds of burning coals. The clouds of burning coals are surrounded on the outside by seven walls of flame(s). The seven walls of flame(s) are surrounded on the outside by seven walls of hailstones (stones of 'El-gabishy). The hailstones are surrounded on the outside by stones of hail (stone of Bar ad). The stones of hail are surrounded on thg outside by stones of “the wings of the tempest”. The stones of “the wings of the tempest” are surrounded on the outside by flames of fire. The flames of fire are surrounded by the chambers of the whirlwind. The chambers of the whirlwind are surrounded on the outside bythe fire and the water. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Round aboutthe fire and the waterare those who utter the “Holy”. Round about those who utter the “Holy” are those who utter the “Blessed”. Round about those who utter the “Blessed” are the bright clouds. The bright clouds are surrounded on the outside by coals of burning juniper ; and on the outside surrounding the cQals of burning juniper there are thousand camps of fire and ten thousand hosts of flame(s). And between every several camp and every several host there is a cloud, so that they may not be burnt by the fire. </p>
