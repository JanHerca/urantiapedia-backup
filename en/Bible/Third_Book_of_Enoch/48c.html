<p> <i>An Enoch-Metatron piece</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  [AEFGH: Aleph made him strong, I took him, I appointed him: (namely) Metatron,my servant who is one (unique) among all the children of heaven. I made him strong in the generation of the first Adam. But when I beheld the men of the generation of the flood, that they were corrupt, then I went and removed my Shekina from among them. And lifted it upon high with the sound of a trumpet and with a shout, as it is written: “God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet”. ] [K: “I seized him, and I took him and I appointed him” — that is Enoch, the ] </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  [AEFGH: “And I took him”: (that is) Enoch, the son of Jared, from among them. And I lifted him up with the sound of a trumpet and with a teru'a (shout) to the high heavens, to be my witness together with the Chayyoth, by the Merkaba in the world to come. ] [K: son of Jared, whose name is Metatron (2) and I took him from among the children of men (5) and made him a Throne over against my Throne. Which is the size of that Throne? Seventy thou- sand parasangs (all) of fire. 9 I committed unto him 70 angels corresponding to the nations (of the world) and I gave into his charge all the household above and below. (7) And I committed to him Wisdom and Intelli- gence more than (to) all the angels. And I called his name “the lesser yah”, whose name is by Gematria 71. And I arranged for him all the works of Creation. And I made his power to tran- scend (lit I made for him power more than) all the ministering angels. (Ends K).] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [AEFGH: I appointed him over all the treasuries and stores that I have in every heaven. And I committed into his hand the keys of every several one. ] [Lm (begins here): He committed unto Metatron — that is Enoch, the son of Jared — all trea- suries. And I appointed him over all the stores that I have in every heaven. And I committed into his hands the keys of each heavenly store. ] </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [AEFGH: I made (of) prince over all the princes and a minister of the Throne of Glory (and) the Halls of 'Araboth: to open their doors to me, and (of) the Throne of Glory, to exalt and arrange it ; (and I appointed him over) the Holy Chayyoth to wreathe crowns upon their heads; the majestic Ophannim to crown them with strength and glory; the honoured Kerubim, to clothe them in majesty; over the radiant sparks, to make them to shine with splendour and brilliance; over the flaming Seraphim, to cover them with highness; the Chashmallim of light, to make them radiant with lightand to prepare the seat for everyjmorning ] [Lm: I made (of) him the prince over all the princes, and I made (of) him a minister of my Throne of Glory, to provide for and arrange the Holy Chayyoth, to wreathe crowns for them (to crown them with crowns), to clothe them with honour and majesty to prepare for them a seat ] [A: as I sit upon the Throne of Glory. And to extol and magnify my glory in the height of my power; (and I have committed unto him) the secrets of above and the secrets of below (heavenly secrets and earthly secrets). ] [FGH: when I am seated upon my Throne in glory and dignity that he may see my glory in the height of my power, in the secrets of above and in the secrets of below. ] [Lm: when he is sitting on his throne to magnify his glory in the height] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  [AFGH: I made him higher than all. The height of his stature, in the midst of all (who are) highof stature (I made) seventy thousand parasangs. I made his Throne great by the majesty of my Throne. And I increased its glory by the honour of my glory.] [Lm: The height of his stature among all those (that are) of high stature (is) seventy thousand parasangs. And I made his glory great as the majesty of my glory ] </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  [AFGH: I transformed his flesh into torches of fire, and all the bones of his body into fiery coals; and I made the appearance of his eyes as the lightning, and the light of his eyebrows as the imperishable light. I made his face bright as the splendour of the sun, and his eyes as the splendour of the Throne of Glory. ] [Lm: and the brilliance of his eyes as the splendour of the Throne of Glory ] </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [AFGH: I made honour and majesty his clothing, beauty and highnesshis covering cloak and a royal crown of 500 by (times) parasangs (his) diadem. ] [Lm: his garment honour and majesty, his royal crown 500 by 500 parasanga.] [AFGHLm: And I put upon him of my honour, my majesty and the splendour, of my glory that is upon my Throne of Glory. I called himthe lesser yhwh, the Prince of the Presence, the Knower of Secrets: for every secret5a did I reveal to himas a fatherand all mysteries declared I unto himin uprightness. ] </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I set up his throne at the door of my Hall that he may sit and judge the heavenly household on high. And I placed every prince before him, to receive authority from him, to perform, his will. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Seventy names did I take from (my) names and called him by them to enhance his glory. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Seventy princes gave into his hand, to command unto them8b my precepts and my wordsin every language; [AFGH: to abase by his word the proud to the ground, and to exalt by the utterance of his lips the humble to the height; to smite kings by his speech, to turn kings away from their paths, to set up (the) rulers over their dominion as it is written: “and he changeth the times and the seasons, and to give wisdom unto all the wiseof the world and understanding (and) knowledge to all who understand knowledge”, as it is written: “and knowledge to them that know understanding”, to reveal to them the secrets of my words and to teach the decree of my righteous judgement, as it is written: ] [Lm: and to abase the proud to the ground and to exalt the humble to the height and to smite kings and to bring rulers low and to set up kings and rulers and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding and I appointed him to reveal secrets and to teach judgement and justice, ] “so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return unto me voidbut shall accomplish (that which I please), E'ie'seh y (I shall accomplish) is not written here, but ll asah y (he shall accomplish), meaning, that whatever word and whatever utterance goes forth from before the Holy One, blessed be He, Metatron stands and carries it out. And he establishes the decrees of the Holy One, blessed be He. (Here the Lm version of fragment c ends.) </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  [“And he shall make to prosperthat which I sent” . 'Asli'a'h (I will make to prosper) is not written here, but w'e'hisli'a'h (and he shall make to prosper), teaching, that whatever decree goes forth from before the Holy One, blessed be He, concerning a man, as soon as he make repentance, they do not “execute it (upon him) but upon another, wicked man, as it is written: ” The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead".] </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And not only that but Metatron sits three hours every day in the high heavens, and he gathers allthe souls ofthose dead who died in their mother's womb, and the sucklings who died on their mother's breasts, and of the scholars who died over the five books of the Law. And he brings them under the Throne of Glory and places them in companies, divisions and classes roundthe Presence: and he teaches them the Law, and (the books) of Wisdom, and Haggada and Tradition and finishes (completes) their instruction (education) [for them]. As it is written: “Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand tradition? them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts”. </p>
