<p> <i>Instances of polar opposites kept in balance by several Divine Names and other similar wonders</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Come and I will show thee, where the waters are suspended in the highest, where fire is burning in the midst of hail, where lightnings lighten out of the midst of snowy mountains, where thunders are roaring in the celestial heights, where a flame is burning in the midst of the burning fire and wherevoices make themselves heard in the midst of thunder and earthquake. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then I wentby his sideand he took me by his hand and lifted me up on his wings and showed me all those things. I beheld the waters suspended on high in 'Araboth Raqia by (force of) the name YAH 'EH YE 'ASHER 'EH YE (Jah, I am that I am), and their fruits going down from heaven and watering the face of the world, as it is written: “(He watereth the mountains from his chambers:) the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy work”. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I saw fire and snow and hailstone that were mingled together within each other and yet were undamaged, by (force of) the name 'ESH 'OKELA (consuming fire), as it is written: “For the Lord, thy God, is a consuming fire”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I saw lightnings that were lightening out of mountains of snowand yet were not damaged (quenched), by (force of) the name YAH SUR 'OLAMIM (Jah, the everlasting rock), as it is written: “For in Jah, YHWH, the everlasting rock”. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I saw thunders and voices that were roaring in the midst of fiery flames and were not damaged (silenced), by (force of) the name'EL-SHADDAI RABBA (the Great God Almighty) as it is written: “I am God Almighty”. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I beheld a flame (and) a glow (glowing flames) that were flaming and glowing in the midst of burning fire, and yet were not damaged (devoured), by (force of) the name YAD AL KES YAH (the hand upon the Throne of the Lord) as it is written: “And he said: for the hand is upon the Throne of the Lord”. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I beheld rivers of fire in the midst of rivers of water and they were not damaged (quenched) by (force of) the name 'OSE SHALOM (Maker of Peace) as it is written: “He maketh peace in his high places”. For he makes peace between the fire and the water, between the hail and the fire, between the wind and the cloud, between the earthquake and the sparks. </p>
