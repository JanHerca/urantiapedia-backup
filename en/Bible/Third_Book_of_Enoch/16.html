<p> <i>Metatron divested of his privilege of presiding on a Throne of his own on account of Achers misapprehension in taking him for a second Divine Power</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, the Glory of all heaven, said to me: At first I was sitting upon agreat Throne at the door of the Seventh Hall; and I was judgingthe children of heaven,the house- hold on highby authority of the Holy One, blessed be He. And I divided Greatness, Kingship, Dignity, Rulership, Honour and Praise, and Diadem and Crown of Glory unto all the princes of kingdoms, while I was presiding (lit. sitting) in the Celestial Court (Yeshiba), and the princes of kingdoms were standing before me, on my right and on my left — by authority of the Holy One, blessed be He. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But when Acher came to behold the vision of the Merkaba and fixed his eyes on me, he feared and trembled before me and his soul was affrighted even unto departing from him, because of fear, horror and dread of me, when he beheld me sitting upon a throne like a king with all the ministering angels standing by me as my servants and all the princes of kingdoms adorned with crowns surrounding me: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  in that moment he opened his mouth and said: “Indeed, there are two Divine Powers in heaven!” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Forthwith Bath Qol (the Divine Voice) went forthfrom heaven from before the Shekina and said: “Return, ye backsliding children, except Acher!” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then came 'Aniyel, the Prince, the honoured, glorified, beloved, wonderful, revered and fearful one, in commission from the Holy One, blessed be He and gave me sixty strokes with lashes of fire and made me stand on my feet. </p>
