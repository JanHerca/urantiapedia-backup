<p> <i>Metatron transformed into fire</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the Prince of the Presence, the Glory of all heavens, said to me: As soon as the Holy One, blessed be He, took mein (His) service to attend the Throne of Glory and the Wheels (Galgallim) of the Merkaba and the needs of Shekina, forthwith my flesh was changed into flames, my sinews into flaming fire, my bones into coals of burning juniper, the light of my eye-lids into splendour of lightnings, my eye-balls into fire-brands, the hair of my head into hot flames, all my limbs into wings of burning fire and the whole of my body into glowing fire. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And on my right were divisions of fiery flames, on my left fire-brands were burning, round about me storm wind and tempest were blowing and in front of me and behind me was roaring of thunder with earthquake. </p>
