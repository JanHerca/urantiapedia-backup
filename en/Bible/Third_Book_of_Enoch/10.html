<p> <i>God places Metatron on a throne at the door of the seventh Hall and announces through the Herald, that Metatron henceforth is God's representative and ruler over all the princes of kingdoms and all the children of heaven, save the eight high princes called YHWH by the name of their King</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: All these things the Holy One, blessed be He, made for me: He made mea Throne, similar to the Throne of Glory. And He spread over me a curtain of splendour and brilliant appearance, of beauty, graceand mercy, similar tothe curtain of the Throne of Glory; and on it were fixed all kinds of lights in the universe. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And He placed it at the door of the Seventh Hall and seated me on it. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the herald went forthinto every heaven, saying: This is Metatron, my servant. I have made him into a prince and a ruler over all the princes of my kingdoms and over all the children of heaven, except the eight great princes, the honoured and revered ones who are called YHWH, by the name of their King. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And every angel and every prince who has a word to speakin my presence (before me) shall go into his presence (before him) and shall speak to him (instead). </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And every command that he utters to youin my name do ye observe and fulfil. For the Prince of Wisdom and the Prince of Understanding have I committed to him to instruct him in the wisdom of heavenly things and of earthly things, in the wisdom of this world and of the world to come. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Moreover, I have set him over all the treasuries of the palapes of 'Araboth and over all the storesof life that have in the high heavens. </p>
