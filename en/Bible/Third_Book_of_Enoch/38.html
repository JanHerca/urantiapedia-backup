<p> <i>The fear that befalls all the heavens at the sound of the ‘Holy,’ esp. the heavenly bodies. These appeased by the Prince of the World</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: At the time, when the ministering angels utter (the Thrice) Holy, then all the pillars of the heavens and their sockets do tremble, and the gates of the Halls of 'Araboth Raqia are shaken and the foundations of Shechaqim and the Universe (Tebel) are moved, and the orders of Ma'on and the chambers of Makon quiver, and all the orders of Raqia and the constellations and the planets are dismayed, and the globes of the sun and the moon haste away and flee out of their courses and run 12,000 parasangs and seek to throw themselves down from heaven, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  by reason of the roaring voice of their chant, and the noise of their praise and the sparks and lightnings that go forth from their faces; as it is written: “The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven (the lightnings lightened the world, the earth trembled and shook)”. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Until the prince of the world calls them, saying: “Be ye quiet in your place ! Fear not because of the ministering angels who sing the Song before the Holy One, blessed be He”. As it is written: “When the morning stars sang together and all the children of heaven shouted for joy”. </p>
