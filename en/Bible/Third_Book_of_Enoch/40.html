<p> <i>The ministering angels rewarded with crowns, when uttering the i i Holyy in its right order, and punished by consuming fire if not. New ones created in the stead of the consumed angels</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: When the ministering angels say “Holy” before the Holy One, blessed be He, in the proper way, then the servants of His Throne, the attendants of His Glory, go forth with great mirth from under the Throne of Glory. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they all carry in their hands, each one of them thousand thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand crowns of stars, similar in appearance to the planet Venus, and put them on the ministering angels and the great princes who utter the “Holy”. Three crowns they put on each one of them: one crown because they say “Holy”, another crown, because they say “Holy, Holy”, and a third crown because they say “Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts”, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And in the moment that they do not utter the “Holy” in the right order, a consuming fire goes forth from the little finger of the Holy One, blessed be He, and falls down in the midst of their ranks and is divided intos thousand parts corresponding to the four camps of the ministering angels, and consumes them in one moment, as it is written: “A fire goeth before him and burneth up his adversaries round about”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  After that the Holy One, blessed be He, opens His mouth and speaks one word and creates others in their stead, new ones like them. And each one stands before His Throne of Glory, uttering the “Holy”, as it is written (Lam. iii.3): “They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness”. </p>
