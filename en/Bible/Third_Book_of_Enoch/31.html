<p> <i>(The attributes of) Justice, Mercy and Truth by the Throne of Judgement</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: At the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting on the Throne, of Judgement, (then) Justice is standing on His right and Mercy on His left and Truthbefore His face. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when man enters before Him to judgement, (then) there comes forth from the splendour of the Mercy towards him as (it were) a staff and stands in front of him. Forthwith man falls upon his face, (and) all the angels of destruction fear and tremble before him, according as it is written: “And with mercy shall the throne be established, and he shall sit upon it in truth.” </p>
