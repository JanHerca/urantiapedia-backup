<p> <i>Enoch lifted up to heaven together with the Shekina. Angels' protests answered by God</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: When the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to lift me up on high, He first sent 'Anaphid H (H= Tetrqgrgmmatfm), the Prince, and he took me from their midst in their sight and carried me in great glory upon a fiery chariot with fiery horses, servants of glory. And he lifted me up to the high heavens together with the Shekina. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As soon as I reached the high heavens, the Holy Chayyoth, the 'Ophannim, the Seraphim, the Kerubim, the Wheels of the Merkaba (the Galgallim), and the ministers of the consuming fire, perceiving my smell from a distance of 365,000 myriads of parasangs, said: [A: “What smell of one born of woman and what taste of a white drop (is this) that ascends on high, and (lo, he is merely) a gnat among those who ‘divide flames’ (of fire)?”] [B: “What is one born of woman between (among) us? The taste of awhite dropwhich ascends to the high heavens to min- isteramong those who ‘divide flames of fire’”.] [CDEL: "What smell of a woman-born is this and what taste of a white drop that ascends to the high heavens to minister among dividers of flames.] </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Holy One, blessed be He, answered and spake unto them: “My servants, my hosts, my Kerubim, my 'Ophannim, my Seraphim! Be ye not displeased on account of this! Since all the children of men have denied meand my great Kingdom and are gone worshipping idols, I have removed my Shekina from among them and have lifted it up on high. But this one whom I have taken from among them is an elect one among (the inhabitants of) the worldand he is equal to all of them in faith, righteousness and perfection of deed and have taken him for (as) a tribute from my world under all the heavens”. </p>
