<p> <i>Metatron shows R. Ishmael the letters engraved on the Throne of Glory by which letters everything in heaven and earth has been created</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Come and behold the letters by which the heaven and the earth were created, </p>
<p> the letters by which were created the mountains and hills, </p>
<p> the letters by which were created the seas and rivers, </p>
<p> the letters by which were created the trees and herbs, </p>
<p> the letters by which were created the planets and the constellations, </p>
<p> the letters by which were createdthe globe of the moon and the globe of the sun, Orion, the Pleiades and all the different luminaries of Raqia. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  the letters by which were created the Throne of Glory and the Wheels of the Merkaba, the letters by which were created the necessities of the worlds, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  the letters by which were created wisdom, understanding, knowledge, prudence, meekness and righteousness by which the whole world is sustained. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I walked by his side and he took me by his hand and raised me upon his wings and showed methose letters, all of them, that are graven with a flaming style on the Throne of Glory: and sparks go forth from them and cover all the chambers of Araboth. </p>
