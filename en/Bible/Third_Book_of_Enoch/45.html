<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I went, and he showed it to me pointing it out with his fingerslike a father who teaches his children the letters of Tora. And I saw each generation, the rulers of each generation, </p>

<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and all the fights and wars that the nationsof the world wrought against the people of Israel in the time of their kingdom. </p>
<p> And I saw Messiah, son of Joseph, and his generationand their works and their doings that they will do against the nations of the world. And I saw Messiah, son of David, and his generation, and all the fights and wars, and their works and their doings that they will do with Israel both for good and evil. And I saw all the fights and wars that Gog and Magog will fightin the days of Messiah, and all that the Holy One, blessed be He, will do with them in the time to come. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And all the rest of allthe leaders of the generations and all the works of the generations both in Israel and in the nations of the world, both what is done and what will be done hereafter to all generations until the end of time, (all) were graven on the Curtain of MAQOM. And I saw all these things with my eyes ; and after I had seen it, I opened my mouth in praise of MAQOM (the Divine Majesty) (saying thus): “For the King's word hath power (and who may say unto him: What doest thou?) Whoso keepeth the commandments shall know no evil thing”. And I said: “O Lord, how manifold are thy works!” </p>
