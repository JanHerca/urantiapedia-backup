<p> <i>The idolatry of the generation of Enosh causes God to remove the Shekina from earth. The idolatry inspired by 'Azza, 'Uzza and 'Azziel</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: From the daywhen the Holy One, blessed be He, expelled the first Adam from the Garden of Eden (and onwards), Shekina was dwelling upon a Kerub under the Tree of Life. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the ministering angels were gathering together and going down from heaven in parties, from the Raqia in companies and from the heavens in camps to do His will inthe whole world. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the first man and his generation were sitting outside the gate of the Garden to behold the radiant appearance of the Shekina. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For the splendour of the Shekina traversed the world from one end to the other(with a splendour) 365,000 times (that) of the globe of the sun. And everyone whomade use ofthe splendour of the Shekina, on him no flies and no gnats did rest, neither was he ill nor suffered he any pain. No demons got power over him, neither were they able to injure him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When the Holy One, blessed be He, went out and went in: from the Garden to Eden, from Eden to the Garden, from the Garden to Raqia and from Raqia to the Garden of Eden then all and everyone beheld the splendour of His Shekina and they were not injured; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  until n the time ofthe generation of Enosh who was the head of all idol worshippers of the world. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And what did the generation of Enosh do? They went from one end of the world to the other, and each one brought silver, gold, precious stones and pearls in heaps like unto mountains and hills making idols out of them throughout all the world. And they erected the idols in every quarter of the world: the size of each idol was parasangs. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And they brought down the sun, the moon, planets and constellations, and placed them before the idols on their right hand and on their left, to attend them even as they attend the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written: “And all the host of heaven was standing by him on his right hand and on his left”. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What power was in them that they were able to bring them down? They would not have been able to bring them down but for 'uzza, 'azza and 'azziel who taught them sorceries whereby they brought them down and made use of them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In that time the ministering angels brought charges (against them) before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying before him: “Master of the World! What hast thou to do with the children of men? As it is written ‘What is man (Enosh) that thou art mindful of him?’ ‘Mah Adam’ is not written here, but ‘Mah Enosh’, for he (Enosh) is the head of the idol worshippers. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Why hast thou left [ADE: the highest of the high heavens, the abode of thy glorious Name, and the high and exalted Throne in 'Arabotk on high] [B: the 'Araboth Raqia which are full of thy glory, mighty and high alike, and the high and exalted Throne in the 'Araboth Raqia in the highest] [CL: the highest of the high heavens which are filled with the majesty of thy glory and are high, uplifted and exalted, and the high and exalted Throne in the Raqia 'Araboth on high] and art gone and dwellest with the children of men who worship idols and equal thee to the idols. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now thou art on earth and the idols likewise. What hast thou to do with the inhabitants of the earth who worship idols?” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, lifted up His Shekina from the earth, from their midst. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In that moment came the ministering angels, the troops of hosts and the armies of 'Araboth in thousand camps and ten thousand hosts: they fetched trumpets and took the horns in their hands and surrounded the Shekina with all kinds of songs. And He ascended to the high heavens, as it is written: “God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet”. </p>
