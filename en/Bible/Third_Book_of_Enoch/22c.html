<p> <i>(in B, Lo and Lmr)</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ishmael said: Metatron y the Prince of the Presence said to me: What is the distance between one bridge and another? 12 myriads of parasangs. Their ascent is myriads of parasangs, and their descent 12 myriads of parasangs. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  (The distance) between the rivers of dread and the rivers of fear is 22 myriads of parasangs; between the rivers of hail and the rivers of darkness 36 myriads of parasangs; between the chambers of lightnings and the clouds of compassion 42 myriads of parasangs; between the clouds of compassion and the Merkaba 148 myriads ofparasangs; between the Merkaba and the Kerubim 148 myriads of parasangs; between the Kerubim and the 'Ophannim 24 myriads of parasangs; between the Ophannim and the chambers of chambers 24 myriads of parasangs; between the chambers of chambers and the Holy Chayyoth 40,000 myriads of parasangs; between one whig (of the Chayyoth) and another 12 myriads of parasangs; and the breadth of each one wing is of that same measure; and the distance between the Holy Chayyoth and the Throne of Glory is 30,000 myriads of parasangs. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And from the foot of the Throne tothe seatthere are 40,000 myriads of parasangs. And the name of Him that sitteth on it: let the name be sanctified! </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [And the arches of the Bow are set above the 'Araboth, and they are 1000 thousands and 10,000 times ten thousands (of parasangs) high. Their measure is after the measure of the Irin and Qaddishin (Watchers and Holy Ones). As it is written “My bow I have set in the cloud”. It is not written here “I will set” but “I have set”, (i.e.) already; clouds that surround the Throne of Glory. As His clouds pass by, the angels of hail (turn into) burning coal. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And a fire of the voice goes down from by the Holy Chayyoth. And because of the breath of that voice they “run” to another place, fearing lest it command them to go; and they “return” lest it injure them from the other side. Therefore “they run and return”. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And these arches of the Bow are morebeautiful and radiant than the radiance of the sun during the summer solstice. And they are whiter than a flaming fire and they are great and beautiful. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Above the arches of the Bow are the wheels of the 'Ophannim. Their height is 1000 thousand and 10,000 times 10,000 units of measure after the measure of the Seraphim and the Troops (Gedudim).] </p>
