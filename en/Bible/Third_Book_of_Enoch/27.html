<p> <i>Radweriel, the keeper of the Book of Records</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel x of H', the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Above the Seraphim there is one prince, exalted above all the princes, wondrous more than all the servants. His name is Radweriel H' who is appointed over the treasuries of the books. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He fetches forth the Case of Writings (with) the Book of Records in it, and brings it before the Holy One, blessed be He. And he breaks the seals of the case,opens it, takes out the books and delivers them before the Holy One, blessed be He. And the Holy One, blessed be He, receives them of his hand and gives them in his sight to the Scribes, that they may read themin the Great Beth Dinin the height of 'Araboth Raqia', before the heavenly household. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And why is he called radweriel? Because out of every word that goes forth from his mouth an angel is created: and he stands in the songs (in the singing company) of the ministering angels and utters a song before the Holy One, blessed be He when the time draws nigh for the recitation of the (Thrice) Holy. </p>
