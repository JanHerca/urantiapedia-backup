<p> <i>The princes of Kingdoms and the Prince of the World officiating at the Great Sanhedrin in heaven</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: Whenever the Great Beth Din is seated in the 'Araboth Raqia on high there is no opening of the mouth for anyone in the world save those great princes who are called H' by the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  How many are those princes? Seventy-two princes of the kingdoms of the world besides the Prince of the World who speaks (pleads) in favour of the world before the Holy One, blessed be He, every day, at the hour when the book is opened in which are recorded all the doings of the world, according as it is written: “The judgement was set and the books were opened.” </p>
