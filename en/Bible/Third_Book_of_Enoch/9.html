<p> <i>Enoch receives blessings from the Most High and is adorned with angelic attributes</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: After all these things the Holy One, blessed be He, put His hand upon me and blessed me with1 blessings. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I was raised and enlarged to the size of the length and width of the world. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And He caused wings to grow on me, on each side. And each wing was as the whole world. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And He fixed on me 365 eyes: each eye was as the great luminary. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And He left no kind of splendour, brilliance, radiance, beauty in (of) all the lights of the universe that He did not fix on me. </p>
