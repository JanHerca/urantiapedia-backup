<p> <i>Metatron shows R. Ishmael the Right Hand of the Most High, now inactive behind Him, but in the future destined to work the deliverance of Israel</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: Come, and I will show thee the Right Hand of MAQOM, laid behind (Him) because of the destruction of the Holy Temple ; from which all kinds of splendour and lightshine forthand by which the heavens were created ; and whom not even the Seraphim and the 'Ophannim are permitted (to behold), until the day of salvation shall arrive. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I went by his side and he took me by his hand and showed me (the Right Hand of MAQOM) y withall manner of praise, rejoicing and song: and no mouth can tell its praise, and no eye can behold it, because of its greatness, dignity, majesty, glory and beauty. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And not only that 4, but all the souls of the righteous who are counted worthy to 4a behold the joy of Jerusalem, they are standing by it, praising and praying before it three times every day, saying: “ Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord” according as it is written: “He caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses”. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In that moment the Right Hand of MAQOM was weeping. And there went forth from its five fingers five rivers of tears and fell down into the great sea and shook the whole world, according as it is written: “The earth is utterly broken, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly, the earth shall stagger like a drunken man and shall be moved to and fro like a hut”, five times corresponding to the fingers of his Great Right Hand. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But when the Holy One, blessed be He, sees, that there is no righteous man in the generation, and no pious man (Chasid) on earth, and no justice in the hands of men ; and (that there is) no man like unto Moses, and no intercessor as Samuel who could pray before MAQOM for the salvationand for the deliverance, and for His Kingdom, that it be revealed in the whole world; and for His great Right Handthat He put it before Himself again to work great salvation by it for Israel, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  then forthwith will the Holy One, blessed be He, remember His own justice,favour, mercyand grace: and He will deliver His great Arm by himself, and His righteousness will support Him. According as it is written: “ And he saw, that there was no man” — (that is:) like unto Moses who prayed countless times for Israel in the desert and averted the (Divine) decrees from them — “and he wondered, that there was no intercessor” — like unto Samuel who intreated the Holy One, blessed be He, and called unto Him and he answered him and fulfilled his desire, even if it was not fit (in accordance with the Divine plan), according as it is written: “ Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call unto the Lord”. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And not only that, but He joined fellowship with Moses in every place, as it is written: “Moses and Aaron among His priests”.And again it is written: “Though Moses and Samuel stood before me”: “Mine own arm brought salvation unto me”. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Said the Holy One, blessed be Hein that hour: “ How long shall I wait forthe children of mento .work salvation according to their righteousnessfor my arm? For my own sake and for the sake of my merit and righteousness will I deliver my arm and by itredeem my children from among the nations of the world.” As it is written: “For my own sake will I do it. For how should my name be profaned”. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In that moment will the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal His Great Arm and show it to the nations of the world: for its length is as the length of the worldand its breadth is as the width of the world. And the appearance of its splendour is like unto the splendour of the sunshine in its might, in the summer solstice. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Forthwith Israel will be saved from amongthe nations of the world. And Messiah will appear unto them and He will bring them up to Jerusalem with great joy. And not only that but [A: they will eat and drink for they will glorify the Kingdom of Messiah, of the house of David, in the four quarters of the world. And the nations of the world will not prevail against them, ] [E: Israel will come from the four quarters of the world and eat with Messiah. But the nations of the world shall not eat with them, ] as it is written: “The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God”. And again: “The Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him”.: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth”. </p>
