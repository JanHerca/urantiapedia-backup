<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the door keepers of the seventh Hall, when they see the four great princes, the honoured ones, who are appointed over the four camps of shekina, they remove the crown(s) of glory from their head and fall on their faces. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the four great princes, when they see tag' as,the prince, great and honouredwith song (and) praise, at the head of all the children of heaven, they remove the crown of glory from their head and fall on their faces. </p>

Why is he called by the name of 'Anaphiel? Because the bough of his honour and majesty and his crown and his splendour and his brilliance covers (overshadows) all the chambers of 'Araboth Raqia on high even as the Maker of the World (doth overshadow them). Just as it is written with regard to the Maker of the World: “His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise”, even so do the honour and majesty of 'Anaphiel cover all the glories of 'Araboth the highest. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And when he sees Sother 'Ashiel H', the prince, the great, fearful and honoured one, he removes the crown of glory from his head and falls on his face. Why is he called Sother Ashiel? Because he is appointed over the four heads of the fiery river over against the Throne of Glory; and every single prince who goes out or enters before the Shekina, goes out or enters only by his permission. For the seals of the fiery river are entrusted to him. And furthermore, his height is 7000 myriads of parasangs. And he stirs up the fire of the river; and he goes out and enters before the Shekina to expoundwhat is written (recorded) concerning the inhabitants of the world. According as it is written: “the judgement was set, and the books were opened”. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Sother 'Ashiel the prince, when he sees Shoqed Chozi, the great prince, the mighty, terrible and honoured one, he removes the crown of glory from his head and falls upon his face. And why is he called Shoqed Chozi? Because he weighs all the merits (of man) in a balance in the presence of the Holy One, blessed be He. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And when he sees Zehanpuryu H',the great prince, the mighty and terrible one, honoured, glorified and feared in all the heavenly household, he removes the crown of glory from his head and falls on his face.

<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And when hesees 'Azbuga H', the great prince, glorified, revered, honoured, adorned, wonderful, exalted, beloved and feared among all the great princes who know the mystery of the Throne of Glory, he removes the crown of glory from his head and falls on his face. Why is he called 'Azbuga? Because in the future he will gird (clothe) the righteous and pious of the world with the garments of life and wrap them in the cloak of life, that they may live in them an eternal life. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And when he sees the two great princes, the strong and glorified ones who are standing above him, he removes the crown of glory from his head and falls on his face. And these are the names of the two princes: </p>
<p> Sopheriel H' (who) killeth, (Sopheriel H' the Killer), the great prince, the honoured, glorified, blameless, venerable, ancient and mighty one; (and)Sopheriel H' (who) maketh alive (Sopheriel H' the Lifegiver), the great prince, the honoured, glorified, blameless, ancient and mighty one. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Why is he called Sopheriel H' who killeth (Sopheriel H' the Killer)? Because he is appointed over the books of the dead: [so that] everyone, when the day of his death draws nigh, he writes him in the books of the dead. </p>
<p> Why is he called Sopheriel H' who maketh alive (Sopheriel H' the Lifegiver)? Because he is appointed over the books of the living (of life), so that every one whom the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring into life, he writes him in the book of the living (of life), by authority of MAQOM. Thou might perhaps say: “Since the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting on a throne, they also are sitting when writing”. (Answer): The Scripture teaches us: “And all the host of heaven are standing by him”. “The host of heaven” (it is said) in order to show us, that even the Great Princes, none like whom there is in the high heavens, do not fulfil the requests of the Shekina otherwise than standing. But how is it (possible that) they (are able to) write, when they are standing? It is like this: </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  One is standing on the wheels of the tempest and the other is standing on the wheels of the storm-wind. </p>
<p> The one is clad in kingly garments, the other is clad in kingly garments. </p>
<p> The one is wrapped in a mantle of majesty and the other is wrapped in a mantle of majesty. </p>
<p> The one is crowned with a royal crown, and the other is crowned with a royal crown. </p>
<p> The one's body is full of eyes, and the other's body is full of eyes. </p>
<p> The appearance of one is like unto the appearance of lightnings, and the appearance of the other is like unto the appearance of lightnings. </p>
<p> The eyes of the one are like the sun in its might, and the eyes of the other are like the sun in its might. </p>
<p> The one's height is like the height of the seven heavens, and the other's height is like the height of the seven heavens. </p>
<p> The wings of the one are as (many as) the days of the year, and the wings of the other are as (many as) the days of the year. </p>
<p> The wings of the one extend over the breadth of Raqict, and the wings of the other extend over the breadth of Raqia!. </p>
<p> The lips of the one, are as the gates of the East, and the lips of the other are as the gates of the East. </p>
<p> The tongue of the one is as high as the waves of the sea, and the tongue of the other is as high as the waves of the sea. </p>
<p> From the mouth of the one a flame goes forth, and from the mouth of the other a flame goes forth. </p>
<p> From the mouth of the one there go forth lightnings and from the mouth of the other there go forth lightnings. </p>
<p> From the sweat of the one fire is kindled, and from the perspiration of the other fire is kindled. </p>
<p> From the one's tongue a torch is burning, and from the tongue of the other a torch is burning. </p>
<p> On the head of the one there is a sapphire stone, and upon the head of the other there is a sapphire stone. </p>
<p> On the shoulders of the one there is a wheel of a swift cherub, and on the shoulders of the other there is a wheel of a swift cherub. </p>
<p> One has in his hand a burning scroll, the other has in his hand a burning scroll. </p>
<p> The one has in his hand a flaming style, the other has in his hand a flaming style. </p>
<p> The length of the scroll ismyriads of parasangs ; the size of the style is 3000 myriads of parasangs; the size of every single letter that they write is 365 parasangs. </p>
