<p> <i>The angels of Mercy, of Peace and of Destruction by the Throne of Judgement. The scribes, (vss. i,) The angels by the Throne of Glory and the fiery rivers under it. (vss.-5)</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting on the Throne of Judgement,(then) the angels of Mercy are standing on His right, the angels of Peace are standing on His left and the angels of Destruction are standing in front of Him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And one scribe is standing beneathHim, andanother scribe above Him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the glorious Seraphim [A: surround them like firebrands round about the Throne of Glory.] [E: surround the Throne on its four sides with walls of lightnings, and the 'Ophannim  surround them with fire-brands round about the Throne of Glory. ] And clouds of fire and clouds of flames compass them to the right and to the left; and the Holy Chayyoth carry the Throne of Glory from below: each onewith three fingers. The measure of the fingers of each one is 800,000 and times hundred, (and) 66,000 parasangs. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And underneath the feet of the Chayyoth seven fiery rivers are running and flowing. And the breadthof each river is thousand parasangsand its depth isthousand myriads of parasangs. Its length is unsearchable and immeasureable. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And each river turns round in a bow in the four directions of 'Araboth Raqia, and (from there) it falls down to Mot on and is stayed (?), and from Ma'on to Zebul y from Zebul to Shechaqim, from Shechaqim to Raqia, from Raqia to Shamayim and from Shamayim upon the heads of the wicked who are in Gehenna, as it is written: “Behold a whirlwind of the Lord, even his fury, is gone, yea, a whirling tempest; it shall burst upon the head of the wicked”. </p>
