<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He has the “Chariots of the Mercy-Seat”, as it is written: “then he heardthe Voice speaking unto him from upon the mercy-seat”. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He has the “Chariots of Sapphire Stone”, as it is written: “and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone”. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He has the “Chariots of Eagles”, as it is written: “I bare you on eagles' wings”. Eagles literally are not meant here but “they that fly swiftly as eagles”. </p>

And he discerns and sees into them all and knows what is in all of them — and then he sets down the other foot upon him, according as it is written: “Round about eighteen thousand”. </p>
