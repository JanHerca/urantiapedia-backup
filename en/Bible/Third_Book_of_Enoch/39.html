<p> <i>The explicit names fly off from the Throne and all the various angelic hosts prostrate themselves before it at the time of the Qedushsha</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: When the ministering angels utter the “Holy” then all the explicit names that are graven with a flaming style on the Throne of Glory fly off like eagles, with sixteen wings. And they surround and compass the Holy One, blessed be He, on the four sides of the place of His Shekina. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the angels of the host, and the flaming Servants, and the mighty 'Ophanmm, and the Kerubim of the Shekina, and the Holy Chayyoth, and the Seraphim, and the 'Er'ellim, and the Taphsarim and the troopsof consuming fire, and the fiery armies, and the flaming hosts, and the holy princes, adorned with crowns, clad in kingly majesty, wrapped in glory, girt with loftiness, fall upon their faces three times, saying: “ Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever”. </p>
