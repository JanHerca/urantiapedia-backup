<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And then His kingdom shall appear throughout all His creation, And then Satan shall be no more, And sorrow shall depart with him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then the hands of the angel shall be filled Who has been appointed chief, And he shall forthwith avenge them of their enemies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the Heavenly One will arise from His royal throne, And He will go forth from His holy habitation With indignation and wrath on account of His sons. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the earth shall tremble: to its confines shall it be shaken: And the high mountains shall be made low And the hills shall be shaken and fall. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the horns of the sun shall be broken and he shall be turned into darkness; And the moon shall not give her light, and be turned wholly into blood. And the circle of the stars shall be disturbed. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the sea shall retire into the abyss, And the fountains of waters shall fail, And the rivers shall dry up. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the Most High will arise, the Eternal God alone, And He will appear to punish the Gentiles, And He will destroy all their idols. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then you, O Israel, shall be happy, And you shall mount upon the necks and wings of the eagle, And they shall be ended. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And God will exalt you, And He will cause you to approach to the heaven of the stars, In the place of their habitation. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And you will look from on high and see your enemies in Ge(henna) And you shall recognize them and rejoice, And you shall give thanks and confess thy Creator. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And do you; Joshua (the son of) Nun, keep these words and this book; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For from my death [assumption] until His advent there shall be 250 times [= year-weeks = 1750 years]. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And this is the course of the times which they shall pursue till they are consummated. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And I shall go to sleep with my fathers. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Wherefore, Joshua you (son of) Nun, (be strong and) be of good courage; (for) God has chosen (you) to be minister in the same covenant. </p>
