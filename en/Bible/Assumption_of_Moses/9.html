<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then in that day there shall be a man of the tribe of Levi, whose name shall be Taxo, who having seven sons shall speak to them exhorting (them): </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Observe, my sons, behold a second ruthless (and) unclean visitation has come upon the people, and a punishment merciless and far exceeding the first.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “For what nation or what region or what people of those who are impious towards the Lord, who have done many abominations, have suffered as great calamities as have befallen us?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Now, therefore, my sons, hear me: for observe and know that neither did the fathers nor their forefathers tempt God, so as to transgress His commands.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “And you know that this is our strength, and thus we will do.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “Let us fast for the space of three days and on the fourth let us go into a cave which is in the field, and let us die rather than transgress the commands of the Lord of Lords, the God of our fathers.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “For if we do this and die, our blood shall be avenged before the Lord.” </p>
