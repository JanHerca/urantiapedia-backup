<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then there shall be raised up unto them kings bearing rule, and they shall call themselves priests of the Most High God: they shall assuredly work iniquity in the holy of holies. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And an insolent king shall succeed them, who will not be of the race of the priests, a man bold and shameless, and he shall judge them as they shall deserve. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he shall cut off their chief men with the sword, and shall destroy them in secret places, so that no one may know where their bodies are. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He shall slay the old and the young, and he shall not spare. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then the fear of him shall be bitter unto them in their land. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he shall execute judgments on them as the Egyptians executed upon them, during thirty and four years, and he shall punish them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he shall beget children, (who) succeeding him shall rule for shorter periods. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Into their parts cohorts and a powerful king of the west shall come, who shall conquer them: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and he shall take them captive, and burn a part of their temple with fire, (and) shall crucify some around their colony. </p>
