<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Testament of Moses even the things which he commanded in the one hundred and twentieth year of his life, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that is the two thousand five hundredth year from the creation of the world: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [But according to oriental reckoning the two thousand and seven hundredth, and the four hundredth after the departure from Phoenicia], </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  when the people had gone forth after the Exodus that was made by Moses to Amman beyond the Jordan, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  in the prophecy that was made by Moses in the book Deuteronomy: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and he called to him Joshua the son of Nun, a man approved of the Lord, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  that he might be the minister of the people and of the tabernacle of the testimony with all its holy things, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and that he might bring the people into the land given to their fathers, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  that it should be given to them according to the covenant and the oath, which He spoke in the tabernacle to give (it) by Joshua: saying to Joshua these words: </p>
<p id="v10“"><sup><small>10“</small></sup>  (Be strong) and of a good courage so as to do with thy might all that has been commanded that you may be blameless unto God.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So says the Lord of the world. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For He has created the world on behalf of His people. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But He was not pleased to manifest this purpose of creation from the foundation of the world, in order that the Gentiles might thereby be convicted, yea to their own humiliation might by (their) arguments convict one another. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Accordingly He designed and devised me, and He prepared me before the foundation of the world, that I should be the mediator of His covenant. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And now I declare unto you that the time of the years of my life is fulfilled and I am passing away to sleep with my fathers even in the presence of all the people. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And receive this writing that you may know how to preserve the books which I shall deliver unto you: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and you shall set these in order and anoint them with oil of cedar and put them away in earthen vessels in the place which He made from the beginning of the creation of the world, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  that His name should be called upon until the day of repentance in the visitation wherewith the Lord will visit them in the consummation of the end of the days. </p>
