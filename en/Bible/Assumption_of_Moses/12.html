<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when Joshua had finished (these) words, he cast himself again at the feet of Moses. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Moses took his hand and raised him into the seat before him, and answered and said unto him: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “Joshua, do not despise yourself; but set your mind at ease, and hear my words.” </p>
