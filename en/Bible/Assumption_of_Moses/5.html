<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when the times of chastisement draw nigh and vengeance arises through the kings who share in their guilt and punish them, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  they themselves also shall be divided as to the truth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherefore it hath been said: “They shall turn aside from righteousness and approach iniquity, and they shall defile with pollutions the house of their worship,” and [because] “they shall prostitute themselves with strange gods.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For they shall not follow the truth of God, but some shall pollute the altar with the (very) gifts which they offer to the Lord, who are not priests but slaves, sons of slaves. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And many in those times shall have respect unto desirable persons and receive gifts, and pervert judgment [on receiving presents]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And on this account the colony and the borders of their habitation shall be filled with lawless deeds and iniquities: those who wickedly depart from the Lord shall be judges: they shall be ready to judge for money as each may wish. </p>
