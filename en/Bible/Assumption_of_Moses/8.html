<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and those who conceal (it) he shall torture and deliver them up to be bound and led into prison. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And their wives shall be given to the gods among the Gentiles, and their young sons shall be operated on by the physicians in order to bring forward their foreskin. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And others amongst them shall be punished by tortures and fire and sword, and they shall be forced to bear in public their idols, polluted as they are like those who keep them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they shall likewise be forced by those who torture them to enter their inmost sanctuary, and they shall be forced by goads to blaspheme with insolence the word, finally after these things the laws and what they had above their altar. </p>
