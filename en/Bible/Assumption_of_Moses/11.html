<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when Joshua had heard the words of Moses that were so written in his writing all that he had before said, he rent his clothes and cast himself at Moses' feet. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Moses comforted him and wept with him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Joshua answered him and said: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Why do you comfort me, (my) lord Moses? And how shall I be comforted in regard to the bitter word which you hast spoken which has gone forth from thy mouth, which is full of tears and lamentation, in that you depart from this people?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “(But now) what place shall receive you?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “Or what shall be the sign that marks (your) sepulcher?” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “Or who shall dare to move your body from there as that of a mere man from place to place?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “For all men when they die have according to their age their sepulchers on earth; but your sepulcher is from the rising to the setting sun, and from the south to the confines of the north: all the world is your sepulcher.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “My lord, you are departing, and who shall feed this people?” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “Or who is there that shall have compassion on them and who shall be their guide by the way?” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “Or who shall pray for them, not omitting a single day, in order that I may lead them into the land of their forefathers?” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  “How therefore am I to foster this people as a father (his) only son, or as a mistress her daughter, a virgin who is being prepared to be given to the husband whom she will revere, while she guards her person from the sun and (takes care) that her feet are not unshod for running upon the ground.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  “(And how) shall I supply them with food and drink according to the pleasure of their will?” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  “For of them, there shall be 600,000 (men), for these have multiplied to this degree through your prayers, (my) lord Moses.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  “And what wisdom or understanding have I that I should judge or answer by word in the house (of the Lord)?” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  “And the kings of the Amorites also when they hear that we are attacking them, believing that there is no longer among them the holy spirit who was worthy of the Lord, manifold and incomprehensible, the lord of the word, who was faithful in all things, God's chief prophet throughout the earth, the most perfect teacher in the world, [that he is no longer among them], shall say ‘Let us go against them’.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  “If the enemy have but once wrought impiously against their Lord, they have no advocate to offer prayers on their behalf to the Lord, like Moses the great messenger, who every hour day and night had his knees fixed to the earth, praying and looking for help to Him that rules all the world with compassion and righteousness, reminding Him of the covenant of the fathers and propitiating the Lord with the oath.” </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  “For they shall say: ‘He is not with them: let us go therefore and destroy them from off the face of the earth’. What shall then become of this people, my lord Moses.” </p>
