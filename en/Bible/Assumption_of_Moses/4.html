<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then there shall enter one who is over them, and he shall spread forth his hands, and kneel upon his knees and pray on their behalf saying: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Lord of all, King on the lofty throne, who rules the world, and did will that this people should be Your elect people, then (indeed) You didst will that You should be called their God, according to the covenant which You didst make with their fathers.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “And yet they have gone in captivity in another land with their wives and their children, and around the gates of strange peoples and where there is great vanity.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Regard and have compassion on them, O Lord of heaven.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then God will remember them on account of the covenant which He made with their fathers. and He will manifest His compassion in those times also. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And He will put it into the mind of a king to have compassion on them, and he shall send them off to their land and country. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then some portions of the tribes shall go up and they shall come to their appointed place, and they shall anew surround the place with walls. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the two tribes shall continue in their prescribed faith, sad and lamenting because they will not be able to offer sacrifices to the Lord of their fathers. And the ten tribes shall increase and multiply among the Gentiles during the time of their captivity. </p>
