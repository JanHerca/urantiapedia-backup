<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And now they shall go by means of you into the land which He determined and promised to give to their fathers, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  in the which you shall bless and give to them individually and confirm unto them their inheritance in me and establish for them the kingdom, and you shall appoint them local magistrates according to the good pleasure of their Lord in judgment and righteousness. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And five years after they enter into the land, that thereafter they shall be ruled by chiefs and kings for eighteen years, and during nineteen years the ten tribes shall break away. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the twelve tribes shall go down and transfer the tabernacle of the testimony. Then the God of heaven will make the court of His tabernacle and the tower of His sanctuary, and the two holy tribes shall be (there) established: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  but the ten tribes shall establish kingdoms for themselves according to their own ordinances. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they shall offer sacrifices throughout twenty years: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and seven shall entrench the walls, and I will protect nine, but four shall transgress the covenant of the Lord, and profane the oath which the Lord made with them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And they shall sacrifice their sons to strange gods, and they shall set up idols in the sanctuary, to worship them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And in the house of the Lord they shall work impiety and engrave every form of beast, even many abominations. </p>
