<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For he hath said somewhere of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and in this [place] again, They shall not enter into my rest. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help [us] in time of need. </p>
