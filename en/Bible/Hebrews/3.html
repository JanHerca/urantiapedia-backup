<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, [even] Jesus; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Where your fathers tried [me] by proving [me,] And saw my works forty years. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. </p>
