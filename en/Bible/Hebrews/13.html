<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Let love of the brethren continue. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [Let] marriage [be] had in honor among all, and [let] the bed [be] undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday and to-day, [yea] and for ever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin, are burned without the camp. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after [the city] which is to come. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit [to them]: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this [were] unprofitable for you. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I exhort [you] the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, [even] our Lord Jesus, <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Grace be with you all. Amen. </p>
