## Description

«Book of John, Archbishop of Thessalonica»

_From "The Apocryphal Gospels", Aurelio de Santos Otero (1956)_; original writing of the _Book of John of Thessalonica_, according to the critical edition of M. Jugie.

Aurelio de Santos Otero says:

Tischendorf believed that the so-called _Transitus B_, a venerable Latin apocryphal that dates back to the 4th century and is attributed to Melito, bishop of Sardis, was a tributary of the aforementioned book of John the Theologian. However, both the style and the content were calling for a different source for both, if not _Ps Melito_ had to be considered already as a source of inspiration for many other apocryphal narratives.

Jugie thought this last when he offered us in 1926 the critical text of the _Homily of John of Thessalonica_, in which he saw nothing more than a simple corrected and amplified wording of _Ps. Melito_. For his part, A. Wilmart published his _Transitus W_ in 1933, based on ten mss. from the 8th-13th century, whose background is closely related to the Assumptionist narratives of _John of Thessaloniki_ and _Ps. Melito_.

We find, therefore, at least three analogous narratives, coming from the same apocryphal trunk, each of which claims primacy over the others. Wilmart thinks his _Transitus W_ is the source of _Ps. Melito_.

Riviére abounds in the same sense, making _Transitus W_ the source of _Thessalonian_ and _Ps. Melito_.

Faller wants to claim the primacy of the _Ps. Melito_, whom he considers the predecessor of _Transitus W_ and _Thessalonian_.

Jugie also leaves the _Ps. Melito_, on whom he makes the _Thessalonian_ depend, considering the _Transitus W_ as a mere summary of the latter.

Perhaps all of these researchers are somewhat right in their point of view; But it is urgent to delimit the issue, considering two different latent problems in it: first, the date of the documents that we have; second, the origin and priority of the apocryphal narrative contained in said documents.

In relation to the first problem, it is evident that the oldest document of the three that we consider is the _Ps. Melito_, which dates back to the late 4th or early 5th century, while the _Thessalonian_ dates back to the early 7th century.

Regarding the second problem, we stick to the conclusions of Dom B. Capelle, which seem to be decisive.

This worthy researcher of apocryphal-assumptionist literature, after subjecting the _Transitus W_ and the _Thessalonian_ to a comparative study, deduces that the former, "simple épitomé en vue de l'usage liturgique," cannot in any way be the model of the _Thessalonian_ , and which, if not derived from it, is at least inspired by the apocrypha represented by it.

Subsequently subjecting the three aforementioned apocrypha to a comparative examination and noting that the marginal glosses of the _Transitus W_ coincide almost exactly with the _Thessalonian_, also adding another testimony taken from the Latin manuscript 2672 of the National Library of Paris, analogous in every way to the _Transitus W_, one arrives , finally, to the conclusion that both the _Ps. Melito_ like the _Transitus W_ and the Latin manuscript 2672 from Paris only partially reflect the text of the document that John of Thessalonica used to compose his homily, and that only this has preserved for us the complete text of the apocrypha in question in its original language, only ignoring some details and the vision of the final miracle of the Assumption.
