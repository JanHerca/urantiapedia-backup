<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after [man's] command. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly. </p>
