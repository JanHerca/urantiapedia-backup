<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, [departing] from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; [yet] Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Give them, O Jehovah-what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations. </p>
