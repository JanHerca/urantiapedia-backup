<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return [to me]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him that is] on high, none at all will exalt [him]. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One. </p>
