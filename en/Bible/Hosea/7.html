<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They return, but not to [him that is] on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. </p>
