<p> <i>Of the very marvellous elements of the sun.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND I looked and saw other flying elements of the sun, whose names are Phoenixes and Chalkydri, marvellous and wonderful, with feet and tails in the form of a lion, and a crocodile's head, their appearance is empurpled, like the rainbow; their size is nine hundred measures, their wings are like those of angels, each has twelve, and they attend and accompany the sun, bearing heat and dew, as it is ordered them from God. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus the sun revolves and goes, and rises under the heaven, and its course goes under the earth with the light of its rays incessantly. </p>
