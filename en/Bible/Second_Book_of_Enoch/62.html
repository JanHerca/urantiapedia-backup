<p> <i>Of how it is fitting to bring one's gift with faith, because there is no repentance after death.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BLESSED is the man who in his patience brings his gifts with faith before the Lord's face, because he will find forgiveness of sins. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But if he take back his words before the time, there is no repentance for him; and if the time pass and he do not of his own will what is promised, there is no repentance after death. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because every work which man does before the time, is all deceit before men, and sin before God. </p>
