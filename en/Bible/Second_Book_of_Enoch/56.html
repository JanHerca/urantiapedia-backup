<p> <i>Methosalam asks of his father blessing, that he (sc. Methosalam) may make him (sc. Enoch) food to eat.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  METHOSALAM having answered his father Enoch, said: ‘What is agreeable to thy eyes, father, that I may make before thy face, that thou mayst bless our dwellings, and thy sons, and that thy people may be made glorious through thee, and then that thou mayst depart thus, as the Lord said?’, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Enoch answered to his son Methosalam and said: '‘Hear, child, from the time when the Lord anointed me with the ointment of his glory, there has been no food in me, and my soul remembers not earthly enjoyment, neither do I want anything earthly!’ </p>
