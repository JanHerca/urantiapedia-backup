<p> <i>After Adam's sin God sends him away into the earth ‘whence I took thee,’ but does not wish to ruin him for all years to come.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I SAID to him: 'Earth thou art, and into the earth whence I took thee thou shalt go, and I will not ruin thee, but send thee whence I took thee. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then I can again take thee at My second coming! </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I blessed all my creatures visible and invisible. And Adam was five and half hours in paradise. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I blessed the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, on which he rested from all his works. </p>
