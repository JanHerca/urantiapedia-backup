<p> <i>Mathusal continued to have hope and to await his father Enoch at his couch day and night.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND the Lord said to those men who first led me up: ‘Let Enoch go down on to earth with you, and await him till the determined day.’ </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they placed me by night on my couch. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Mathusal expecting my coming, keeping watch by day and by night at my couch, was filled with awe when he heard my coming, and I told him, ‘Let all my household come together, that I tell them everything.’ </p>
