<p> <i>Of how Enoch was taken on to the second heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND those men took me and led me up on to the second heaven, and showed me darkness, greater than earthly darkness, and there I saw prisoners hanging, watched, awaiting the great and boundless judgement, and these angels were dark-looking, more than earthly darkness, and incessantly making weeping through all hours. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I said to the men who were with me: ‘Wherefore are these incessantly tortured?’ they answered me: ‘These are God's apostates, who obeyed not God's commands, but took counsel with their own will, and turned away with their prince, who also is fastened on the fifth heaven.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I felt great pity for them, and they saluted me, and said to me: ‘Man of God, pray for us to the Lord’; and I answered to them: ‘Who am I, a mortal man, that I should pray for angels? who knoweth whither I go, or what will befall me? or who will pray for me?’ </p>
