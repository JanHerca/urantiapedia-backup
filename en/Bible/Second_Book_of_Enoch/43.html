<p> <i>Enoch shows his children how he measured and wrote out God's judgements.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I my children, measured and wrote out every work and every measure and every righteous judgement. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As one year is more honourable than another, so is one man more honourable than another, some for great possessions, some for wisdom of heart, some for particular intellect, some for cunning, one for silence of lip, another for cleanliness, one for strength, another for comeliness, one for youth, another for sharp wit, one for shape of body, another for sensibility, let it be heard everywhere, but there is none better than he who fears God, he shall be more glorious in time to come. </p>
