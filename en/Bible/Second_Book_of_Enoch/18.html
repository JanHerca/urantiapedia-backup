<p> <i>Of the taking of Enoch on to the fifth heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE men took me on to the fifth heaven and placed me, and there I saw many and countless soldiers, called Grigori, of human appearance, and their size was greater than that of great giants and their faces withered, and the silence of their mouths perpetual, and there was no service on the fifth heaven, and I said to the men who were with me: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wherefore are these very withered and their faces melancholy, and their mouths silent, and wherefore is there no service on this heaven? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they said to me: These are the Grigori, who with their prince Satanail rejected the Lord of light, and after them are those who are held in great darkness on the second heaven, and three of them went down on to earth from the Lord's throne, to the place Ermon, and broke through their vows on the shoulder of the hill Ermon 1 and saw the daughters of men how good they are, and took to themselves wives, and befouled the earth with their deeds, who in all times of their age made lawlessness and mixing, and giants are born and marvellous big men and great enmity. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And therefore God judged them with great judgement, and they weep for their brethren and they will be punished on the Lord's great day. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I said to the Grigori: ‘I saw your brethren and their works, and their great torments, and I prayed for them, but the Lord has condemned them to be under earth till heaven and earth shall end for ever.’ </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I said: ‘Wherefore do you wait, brethren, and do not serve before the Lord's face, and have not put your services before the Lord's face, lest you anger your Lord utterly?’ </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And they listened to my admonition, and spoke to the four ranks in heaven, and lo! as I stood with those two men four trumpets trumpeted together with great voice, and the Grigori broke into song with one voice, and their voice went up before the Lord pitifully and affectingly. </p>
