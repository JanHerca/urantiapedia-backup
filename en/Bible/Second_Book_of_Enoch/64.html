<p> <i>Of how the Lord calls up Enoch, and people took counsel to go and kiss him at the place called Achuzan.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN Enoch had spoken these words to his sons, all people far and near heard how the Lord was calling Enoch. They took counsel together: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  ‘Let us go and kiss Enoch’ and two thousand men came together and came to the place Achuzan where Enoch was, and his sons. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the elders of the people, the whole assembly, came and bowed down and began to kiss Enoch and said to him: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  ‘Our father Enoch, be thou blessed of the Lord, the eternal ruler, and now bless thy sons and all the people, that we may be glorified to-day before thy face. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thou shalt be glorified before the Lord's face for all time, since the Lord chose thee, rather than all men on earth, and designated thee writer of all his creation, visible and invisible, and redeemer of the sins of man, and helper of thy household.’ </p>
