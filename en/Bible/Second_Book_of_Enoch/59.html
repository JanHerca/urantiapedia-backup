<p> <i>Enoch instructs his sons wherefore they may not touch beef because of what comes from it.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHOEVER defiles the soul of beasts, defiles his own soul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For man brings clean animals to make sacrifice for sin, that he may have cure of his soul. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And if they bring for sacrifice clean animals, and birds, man has cure, he cures his soul. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  All is given you for food, bind it by the four feet, that is to make good the cure, he cures his soul. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But whoever kills beast without wounds, kills his own soul and defiles his own flesh. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he who does any beast any injury whatsoever, in secret, it is evil practice, and he defiles his own soul. </p>
