<p> <i>Of the assumption of Enoch to the third heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND those men took me thence, and led me up on to the third heaven, and placed me there; and I looked downwards, and san the produce of these places, such as has never been known for goodness. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw all the sweet-flowering trees and beheld their fruits, which were sweet-smelling, and all the foods borne by them bubbling with fragrant exhalation. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And in the midst of the trees that of life, in that place whereon the Lord rests, when he goes up into paradise; and this tree is of ineffable goodness and fragrance, and adorned more than every existing thing; and on all sides it is in form gold-looking and vermilion and fire-like and covers all, and it has produce from all fruits. </p>

<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And here there is no unfruitful tree, and every place is blessed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And there are three hundred angels very bright, who keep the garden, and with incessant sweet singing and never-silent voices serve the Lord throughout all days and hours. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I said: ‘How very sweet is this place,’ and those men said to me: </p>
