<p> <i>Of Enoch's writing, how he wrote his wonderful journeyings and the heavenly apparitions and himself wrote three hundred and sixty-six books.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND he was telling me all the works of heaven, earth and sea, and all the elements, their passages and goings, and the thunderings of the thunders, the sun and moon, the goings and changes of the stars, the seasons, years, days, and hours, the risings of the wind, the numbers of the angels, and the formation of their songs, and all human things, the tongue of every human song and life, the commandments, instructions, and sweet-voiced singings, and all things that it is fitting to learn. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Pravuil told me: ‘All the things that I have told thee, we have written. Sit and write all the souls of mankind, however many of them are born, and the places prepared for them to eternity; for all souls are prepared to eternity, before the formation of the world.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And all double thirty days and thirty nights, and I wrote out all things exactly, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books. </p>
