<p> <i>Enoch instructs his sons not to swear either by heaven or earth, and shows God's promise, even in the mother's womb.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I SWEAR to you, my children, but I swear not by any oath, neither by heaven nor by earth, nor by any other creature which God created. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Lord said: ‘There is no oath in me, nor injustice, but truth.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If there is no truth in men, let them swear by the words ‘yea, yea,’ or else, ‘nay, nay!’ </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I swear to you, yea, yea, that there has been no man in his mother's womb, but that already before, even to each one there is a place prepared for the repose of the soul, and a measure fixed how much it is intended that a man be tried in this world. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yea, children, deceive not yourselves, for there has been previously prepared a place for every soul of man. </p>
