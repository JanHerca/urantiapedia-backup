<p> <i>Of the great secrets of God, which God revealed and told to Enoch, and spoke with him face to face.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND the Lord summoned me, and said to me: ‘Enoch, sit down on my left with Gabriel.’ </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I bowed down to the Lord, and the Lord spoke to me: Enoch, beloved, all thou seest, all things that are standing finished I tell to thee even before the very beginning, all that I created from non-being, and visible things from invisible. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Hear, Enoch, and take in these my words, for not to My angels have I told my secret, and I have not told them their rise, nor my endless realm, nor have they understood my creating, which I tell thee to-day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For before all things were visible, I alone used to go about in the invisible things, like the sun from east to west, and from west to east. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But even the sun has peace in itself, while I found no peace, because I was creating all things, and I conceived the thought of placing foundations, and of creating visible creation. </p>
