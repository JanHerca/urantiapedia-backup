<p> <i>Of Enoch's assumption; how the angels took him into the first heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  IT came to pass, when Enoch had told his sons, that the angels took him on to their wings and bore him up on to the first heaven and placed him on the clouds. And there I looked, and again I looked higher, and saw the ether, and they placed me on the first heaven and showed me a very great Sea, greater than the earthly sea. </p>
