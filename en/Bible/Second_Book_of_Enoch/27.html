<p> <i>Of how God founded the water, and surrounded it with light, and established on it seven islands.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND I commanded that there should be taken from light and darkness, and I said: ‘Be thick,’ and it became thus </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I separated between light and between darkness, that is to say in the midst of the water hither and thither, and I said to the light, that it should be the day, and to the darkness, that it should be the night, and there was evening and there was morning the first day. </p>
