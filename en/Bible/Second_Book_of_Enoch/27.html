<p> <i>Of how God founded the water, and surrounded it with light, and established on it seven islands.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND I commanded that there should be taken from light and darkness, and I said: ‘Be thick,’ and it became thus and I spread it out with the light, and it became water, and I spread it out over the darkness, below the light, and then I made firm the waters, that is to say the bottomless, and I made foundation of light around the water, and created seven circles from inside, and imaged it (sc. the water) like crystal wet and dry, that is to say like glass, and the circumcession of the waters and the other elements, and I showed each one of them its road, and the seven stars each one of them in its heaven, that they go thus, and I saw that it was good. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I separated between light and between darkness, that is to say in the midst of the water hither and thither, and I said to the light, that it should be the day, and to the darkness, that it should be the night, and there was evening and there was morning the first day. </p>
