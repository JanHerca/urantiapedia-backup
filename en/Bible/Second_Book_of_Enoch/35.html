<p> <i>God leaves one righteous man of Enoch's tribe with his whole house, who did God's pleasure according to his will.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BEHOLD from their seed shall arise another generation, much afterwards, but of them many will be very insatiate. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He who raises that generation, shall reveal to them the books of thy handwriting, of thy fathers, to them to whom he must point out the guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my pleasure, who do not acknowledge my name in vain. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they shall tell another generation, and those others having read shall be glorified thereafter, more than the first. </p>
