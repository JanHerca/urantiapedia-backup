<p> <i>Here they took Enoch up on to the fourth heaven where is the course of sun and moon.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THOSE men took me, and led me up on to the fourth heaven, and showed me all the successive goings, and all the rays of the light of sun and moon. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I measured their goings and compared their light, and saw that the sun's light is greater than the moon's. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Its circle and the wheels on which it goes always, like a wind going past with very marvellous speed, and day and night it has no rest. 1 </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Its passage and return are accompanied by four great stars, and each star has under it a thousand stars, to the right of the sun's wheel, and by four to the left, each having under it a thousand stars, altogether eight thousand, issuing with the sun continually. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And by day fifteen myriads of angels attend it, and by night a thousand. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And six-winged ones issue with the angels before the sun's wheel into the fiery flames, and a hundred angels kindle the sun and set it alight. </p>
