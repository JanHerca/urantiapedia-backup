<p> <i>Of how an earthly ruler does not accept from man abominable and unclean gifts, then how much more does God abominate unclean gifts, but sends them away with wrath and does not accept his gifts.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HEAR, my people, and take in the words of my lips. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If any one bring any gifts to an earthly ruler, and have disloyal thoughts in his heart, and the ruler know this, will he not be angry with him, and not refuse his gifts, and not give him over to judgement? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Or if one man make himself appear good to another by deceit of tongue, but have evil in his heart, then will not the other understand the treachery of his heart, and himself be condemned, since his untruth was plain to all? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And when the Lord shall send a great light, then there will be judgement for the just and the unjust, and there no one shall escape notice. </p>
