<p> <i>God relates to Enoch, how out of the very lowest darkness comes down the visible and invisible.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I COMMANDED in the very lowest parts, that visible things should come down from invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! he had a belly of great light. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I said to him: ‘Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible come out of thee.’ </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he came undone, and a great light came out. And I was in the midst of the great light, and as there is born light from light, there came forth a great age, and showed all creation, which I had thought to create. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I saw that it was good. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I placed for myself a throne, and took my seat on it, and said to the light: ‘Go thou up higher and fix thyself high above the throne, and be a foundation to the highest things.’ </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And above the light there is nothing else, and then I bent up and looked up from my throne. </p>
