<p> <i>The elements of the sun, the Phoenixes and Chalkydri broke into song.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN the elements of the sun, called Phoenixes and Chalkydri break into song, therefore every bird flutters with its wings, rejoicing at the giver of light, and they broke into song at the command of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The giver of light comes to give brightness to the whole world, and the morning guard takes shape, which is the rays of the sun, and the sun of the earth goes out, and receives its brightness to light up the whole face of the earth, and they showed me this calculation of the sun's going. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the gates which it enters, these are the great gates of the computation of the hours of the year; for this reason the sun is a great creation, whose circuit lasts twenty-eight years, and begins again from the beginning. </p>
