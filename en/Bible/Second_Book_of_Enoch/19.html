<p> <i>Of the taking of Enoch on to the sixth heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND thence those men took me and bore me up on to the sixth heaven, and there I saw seven bands of angels, very bright and very glorious, and their faces shining more than the sun's shining, glistening, and there is no difference in their faces, or behaviour, or manner of dress; and these make the orders, and learn the goings of the stars, and the alteration of the moon, or revolution of the sun, and the good government of the world. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when they see evildoing they make commandments and instruction, and sweet and loud singing, and all songs of praise. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These are the archangels who are above angels, measure all life in heaven and on earth, and the angels who are appointed over seasons and years, the angels who are over rivers and sea, and who are over the fruits of the earth, and the angels who are over every grass, giving food to all, to every living thing, and the angels who write all the souls of men, and all their deeds, and their lives before the Lord's face; in their midst are six Phoenixes and six Cherubim and six six-winged ones continually with one voice singing one voice, and it is not possible to describe their singing, and they rejoice before the Lord at his footstool. </p>
