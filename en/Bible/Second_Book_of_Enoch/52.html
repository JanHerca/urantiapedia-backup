<p> <i>God instructs his faithful how they are to praise his name.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BLESSED is the man who opens his lips in praise of God of Sabaoth and praises the Lord with his heart. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Cursed every man who opens his lips for the bringing into contempt and calumny of his neighbour, because he brings God into contempt. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Blessed is he who opens his lips blessing and praising God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Cursed is he before the Lord all the days of his life, who opens his lips to curse and abuse. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Blessed is he who blesses all the Lord's works. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Cursed is he who brings the Lord's creation into contempt. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Blessed is he who looks down and raises the fallen. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Cursed is he who looks to and is eager for the destruction of what is not his. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Blessed is he who keeps the foundations of his fathers made firm from the beginning. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Cursed is he who perverts the decrees of his forefathers. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Blessed is he who implants peace and love. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Cursed is he who disturbs those that love their neighbours. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Blessed is he who speaks with humble tongue and heart to all. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Cursed is he who speaks peace with his tongue, while in his heart there is no peace but a sword. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For all these things will be laid bare in the weighing-scales and in the books, on the day of the great judgement. </p>
