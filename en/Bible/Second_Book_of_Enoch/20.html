<p> <i>Hence they took Enoch into the Seventh Heaven.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AND those two men lifted me up thence on to the seventh Heaven, and I saw there a very great light, and fiery troops of great archangels, incorporeal forces, and dominions, orders and governments, cherubim and seraphim, thrones and many-eyed ones, nine regiments, the Ioanit stations of light, and I became afraid, and began to tremble with great terror, and those men took me, and led me after them, and said to me: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  ‘Have courage, Enoch, do not fear,’ and showed me the Lord from afar, sitting on His very high throne. For what is there on the tenth heaven, since the Lord dwells here? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  On the tenth heaven is God, in the Hebrew tongue he is called Aravat. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And all the heavenly troops would come and stand on the ten steps according to their rank, and would bow down to the Lord, and would again go to their places in joy and felicity, singing songs in the boundless light with small and tender voices, gloriously serving him. </p>
