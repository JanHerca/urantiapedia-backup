<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish's belly. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, [And] thou heardest my voice. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars [closed] upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. </p>
