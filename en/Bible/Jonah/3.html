<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days' journey. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
