<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I was small among my brothers, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the youngest in my father's house; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tended my father's sheep. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My hands made a harp, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my fingers fashioned a lyre. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And who will declare it to my Lord? </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord himself; it is he who hears. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  It was he who sent his messenger </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and took me from my father's sheep, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and anointed me with his anointing oil. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My brothers were handsome and tall, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the Lord was not pleased with them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I went out to meet the Philistine, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he cursed me by his idols. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But I drew his own sword; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beheaded him, and removed reproach from the people of Israel. </p>
