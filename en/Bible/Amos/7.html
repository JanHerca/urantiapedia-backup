<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. </p>
