<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes- </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the [same] maiden, to profane my holy name: </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Behold, I will press [you] in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver [himself]; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah. </p>
