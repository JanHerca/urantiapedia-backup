<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  [seek him] that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name); <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right]. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts. </p>
