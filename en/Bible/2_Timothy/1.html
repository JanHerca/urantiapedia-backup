<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  That good thing which was committed unto [thee] guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. </p>
