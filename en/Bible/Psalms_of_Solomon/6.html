<p> <i>A song of hope and fearlessness and peace.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Happy is the man whose heart is fixed to call upon the name of the Lord; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he remembereth the name of the Lord, he will be saved. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  His ways are made even by the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the works of his hands are preserved by the Lord his God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  At what he sees in his bad dreams, his soul shall not be troubled; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he passes through rivers and the tossing of the seas, he shall not be dismayed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He ariseth from his sleep, and blesseth the name of the Lord: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his heart is at peace, he singeth to the name of his God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he entreateth the Lord for all his house. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the Lord heareth the prayer of every one that feareth God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every request of the soul that hopes for Him doth the Lord accomplish. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Blessed is the Lord, who showeth mercy to those who love Him in sincerity. </p>
