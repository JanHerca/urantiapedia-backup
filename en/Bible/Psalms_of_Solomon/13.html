<p> <i>Of Solomon. A Psalm. Comfort for the righteous.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The right hand of the Lord hath covered me; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right hand of the Lord hath spared us. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The arm of the Lord hath saved us from the sword that passed through, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From famine and the death of sinners. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Noisome beasts ran upon them: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their teeth they tore their flesh, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with their molars crushed their bones. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But from all these things the Lord delivered us. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The righteous was troubled on account of his errors, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest he should be taken away along with the sinners; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For terrible is the overthrow of the sinner; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not one of all these things toucheth the righteous. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For not alike are the chastening of the righteous for sins done in ignorance, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the overthrow of the sinners. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Secretly is the righteous chastened, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest the sinner rejoice over the righteous. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For He correcteth the righteous as a beloved son. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his chastisement is as that of a first-born. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the Lord spareth His pious ones, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And blotteth out their errors by His chastening. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For the life of the righteous shall be for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But sinners shall be taken away into destruction,, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their memorial shall be found no more. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon them that fear Him His mercy. </p>
