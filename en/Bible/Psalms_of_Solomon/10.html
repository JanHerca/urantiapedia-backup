<p> <i>A glorious hymn. Further reference to the eternal covenant between God and Man.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Happy is the man whom the Lord remembereth with reproving, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whom He restraineth from the way of evil with strokes </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he may be cleansed from sin, that it may not be multiplied. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He that maketh ready his back for strokes shall be cleansed, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Lord is good to them that endure chastening. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For He maketh straight the ways of the righteous, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth not pervert them by His chastening. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the mercy of the Lord is upon them that love Him in truth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Lord remembereth His servants in mercy. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For the testimony is in the law of the eternal covenant, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The testimony of the Lord is on the ways of men in His visitation. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Just and kind is our Lord in His judgements for ever, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Israel shall praise the name of the Lord in gladness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the pious shall give thanks in the assembly of the people; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the poor shall God have mercy in the gladness of Israel; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For good and merciful is God for ever, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the assemblies of Israel shall glorify the name of the Lord. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The salvation of the Lord be upon the house of Israel unto everlasting gladness! </p>
