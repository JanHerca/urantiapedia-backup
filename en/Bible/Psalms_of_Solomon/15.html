<p> <i>The psalmist restates the great philosophy of Right and Wrong.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When I was in distress I called upon the name of the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hoped for the help of the God of Jacob and was saved; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the hope and refuge of the poor art Thou, O God. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For who, O God, is strong except to give thanks unto Thee in truth? </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wherein is a man powerful except in giving thanks to Thy name? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A new psalm with song in gladness of heart, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruit of the lips with the well-tuned instrument of the tongue, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first fruits of the lips from a pious and righteous heartâ€” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He that offereth these things shall never be shaken by evil; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame of fire and the wrath against the unrighteous shall not touch him, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When it goeth forth from the face of the Lord against sinners, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To destroy all the substance of sinners, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the mark of God is upon the righteous that they may be saved. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Famine and sword and pestilence shall be far from the righteous, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they shall flee away from the pious as men pursued in war; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But they shall pursue sinners and overtake them, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that do lawlessness shall not escape the judgement of God; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  As by enemies experienced in war shall they be overtaken, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mark of destruction is upon their forehead. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the inheritance of sinners is destruction and darkness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their iniquities shall pursue them unto Sheol beneath. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Their inheritance shall not be found of their children, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For sins shall lay waste the houses of sinners. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And sinners shall perish for ever in the day of the Lord's judgement, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When God visiteth the earth with His judgement. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But they that fear the Lord shall find mercy therein, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall live by the compassion of their God; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But sinners shall perish for ever. </p>
