<p> <i>Sinners “love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin.” Profound wisdom, beautifully expressed.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Faithful is the Lord to them that love Him in truth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To them that endure His chastening, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To them that walk in the righteousness of His commandments, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the law which He commanded us that we might live. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The pious of the Lord shall live by it for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paradise of the Lord, the trees of life, are His pious ones. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Their planting is rooted for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall not be plucked up all the days of heaven: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For the portion and the inheritance of God is Israel. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But not so are the sinners and transgressors, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Their delight is in fleeting corruption, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they remember not God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For the ways of men are known before Him at all times, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And He knoweth the secrets of the heart before they come to pass. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore their inheritance is Sheol and darkness and destruction </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall not be found in the day when the righteous obtain mercy; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But the pious of the Lord shall inherit life in gladness. </p>
