<p> <i>Some remarkable similes of war creeping on Jerusalem. A survey of the sins that brought all this trouble.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Distress and the sound of war hath my ear heard, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of a trumpet announcing slaughter and calamity, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The sound of much people as of an exceeding high wind, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a tempest with mighty fire sweeping through the Negeb. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I said in my heart, Surely God judgeth us; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sound I hear moving towards Jerusalem, the holy city </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My loins were broken at what I heard, my knees tottered; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was afraid, my bones were dismayed like flax. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I said: They establish their ways in righteousness. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I thought upon the judgments of God since the creation of heaven and earth; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I held God righteous in His judgements which have been from of old. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  God bare their sins in the full light of day; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the earth came to know the righteous judgements of God. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In secret places underground their iniquities were committed to provoke Him to anger; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They wrought confusion, son with mother and father with daughter; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They committed adultery, every man with his neighhour's wife. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They concluded covenants with one another with an oath touching these things; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They plundered the sanctuary of God, as though there was no avenger. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They trode the altar of the Lord, coming straight from all manner of uncleanness; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with menstrual blood they defiled the sacrifices, as though these were common flesh. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They left no sin undone, wherein they surpassed not the heathen. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Therefore God mingled for them a spirit of wandering; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave them to drink a cup of undiluted wine, that they might become drunken. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He brought him that is from the end of the earth, that smiteth mightily; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decreed war against Jerusalem, and against her land. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The princes of the land went to meet him with joy: they said unto him: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed be thy way! Come ye, enter ye in with peace. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  They made the rough ways even, before his entering in; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  As a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in peace; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He established his feet there in great safety. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the water of uncleanness. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in defilement. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  They did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had done: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the name of God. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations of the earth; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their midst. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His righteousness. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Behold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy righteousness; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Turn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  For Thy faithfulness is with us, </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though there were none to deliver. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But Thou art our God from the beginning, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And we will not depart from Thee, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For good are Thy judgements upon us. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of His pious ones; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever. </p>
