<p> <i>A conversation of Solomon with the Men-pleasers.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wherefore sittest thou, O profane man, in the council of the pious, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that thy heart is far removed from the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provoking with transgressions the God of Israel? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Extravagant in speech, extravagant in outward seeming beyond all men, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he that is severe of speech in condemning sinners in judgement. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And his hand is first upon him as though he acted in zeal, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet he is himself guilty in respect of manifold sins and of wantonness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  His eyes are upon every woman without distinction; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tongue lieth when he maketh contract with an oath. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  By night and in secret he sinneth as though unseen, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his eyes he talketh to every woman of evil compacts. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He is swift to enter every house with cheerfulness as though guileless. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let God remove those that live in hypocrisy in the company of the pious, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the life of such an one with corruption of his flesh and penury. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let God reveal the deeds of the men-pleasers, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deeds of such an one with laughter and derision; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That the pious may count righteous the judgement of their God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When sinners are removed from before the righteous, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the man-pleaser who uttereth law guilefully. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And their eyes are fixed upon any man's house that is still secure, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they may, like the Serpent, destroy the wisdom of . . . with words of transgressors, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  His words are deceitful that he may accomplish his wicked desire. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He never ceaseth from scattering families as though they were orphans, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, he layeth waste a house on account of his lawless desire. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He deceiveth with words, saying, There is none that seeth, or judgeth. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He fills one house with lawlessness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then his eyes are fixed upon the next house, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To destroy it with words that give wing to desire. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Yet with all these his soul like Sheol, is not sated. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let his portion, O Lord, be dishonoured before thee; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him go forth groaning, and come home cursed. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Let his life be spent in anguish, and penury, and want, O Lord; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let his sleep be beset with pains and his awaking with perplexities. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Let sleep be withdrawn from his eyelids at night; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him fail dishonourably in every work of his hands. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Let him come home empty-handed to his house, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his house be void of everything wherewith he could sate his appetite. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Let his old age be spent in childless loneliness until his removal by death. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let the flesh of the men-pleasers be rent by wild beasts, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let the bones of the lawless lie dishonoured in the sight of the sun. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Let ravens peck out the eyes of the hypocrites. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For they have laid waste many houses of men, in dishonour, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And scattered them in their lust; </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And they have not remembered God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor feared God in all these things; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they have provoked God's anger and vexed Him. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  May He remove them from off the earth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because with deceit they beguiled the souls of the flawless. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Blessed are they that fear the Lord in their flawlessness; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord shall deliver them from guileful men and sinners, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And deliver us from every stumbling-block of the lawless (men). </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Let God destroy them that insolently work all unrighteousness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a great and mighty judge is the Lord our God in righteousness. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon all them that love Thee. </p>
