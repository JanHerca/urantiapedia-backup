<p> <i>With this psalm end the warlike Songs of Solomon.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Lord, Thy mercy is over the works of Thy hands for ever; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy goodness is over Israel with a rich gift. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thine eyes look upon them, so that none of them suffers want; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine ears listen to the hopeful prayer of the poor. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thy judgements are executed upon the whole earth in mercy; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thy love is toward the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy chastisement is upon us as upon a first-born, only-begotten son, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To turn back the obedient soul from folly that is wrought in ignorance. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May God cleanse Israel against the day of mercy and blessing, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the day of choice when </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Blessed shall they be that shall be in those days, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bringeth back His anointed. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In that they shall see the goodness of the Lord which He shall perform for the generation that is to come, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Under the rod of chastening of the Lord's anointed in the fear of his God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spirit of wisdom and righteousness and strength; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That he may direct every man in the works of righteousness by the fear of God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he may establish them all before the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good generation living in the fear of God in the days of mercy. Selah. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Great is our God and glorious, dwelling in the highest. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  It is He who hath established in their courses the lights of heaven for determining seasons from year to year, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they have not turned aside from the way which He appointed them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In the fear of God they pursue their path every day, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the day God created them and for evermore. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And they have erred not since the day He created them. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the generations of old they have not withdrawn from their path, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless God commanded them so to do by the command of His servants. </p>
