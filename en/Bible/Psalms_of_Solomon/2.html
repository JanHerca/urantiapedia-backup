<p> <i>The desecration of Jerusalem; captivity, murder, and raping. A psalm of utter despair.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When the sinner waxed proud, with a battering-ram he cast down fortified walls, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou didst not restrain him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Alien nations ascended Thine altar, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They trampled it proudly with their sandals; </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because the sons of Jerusalem had defiled the holy things of the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had profaned with iniquities the offerings of God. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore He said: Cast them far from Me; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   .       .       .       .       .       . </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  It was set at naught before God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was utterly dishonoured; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The sons and the daughters were m grievous captivity, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sealed was their neck, branded was it among the nations. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  According to their sins hath He done unto them, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For He hath left them in the hands of them that prevailed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He hath turned away His face from pitying them, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young and old and their children together; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For they had done evil one and all, in not hearkening. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the heavens were angry, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the earth abhorred them; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For no man upon it had done what they did, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the earth recognized all </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy righteous judgements, O God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They set the sons of Jerusalem to be mocked at in return for the harlots in her; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every wayfarer entered in in the full light of day. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They made mock with their transgressions, as they themselves were wont to do; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the full light of day they revealed their iniquities. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the daughters of Jerusalem were defiled in accordance with Thy judgement, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they had defiled themselves with unnatural intercourse. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I am pained in my bowels and my inward parts for these things. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And yet I will justify Thee, O God, in uprightness of heart, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For in Thy judgements is Thy righteousness displayed, O God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For Thou hast rendered to the sinners according to their deeds, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, according to their sins, which were very wicked. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thou hast uncovered their sins, that Thy judgement might be manifest; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast wiped out their memorial from the earth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  God is a righteous judge, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he is no respecter of persons. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For the nations reproached Jerusalem, trampling it down; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beauty was dragged down from the throne of glory. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  She girded on sackcloth instead of comely raiment, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rope was about her head instead of a crown. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  She put off the glorious diadem which God had set upon her, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dishonour was her beauty cast upon the ground. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And I saw and entreated the Lord and said, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long enough, O Lord has Thine hand been heavy on Israel, in bringing the nations upon them. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For they have made sport unsparingly in wrath and fierce anger; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will make an utter end, unless Thou, O Lord, rebuke them in Thy wrath. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For they have done it not in zeal, but in lust of soul, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pouring out their wrath upon us with a view to rapine. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Delay not, O God, to recompense them on their heads, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To turn the pride of the dragon into dishonour. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And I had not long to wait before God showed me the insolent one </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slain on the mountains of Egypt, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Esteemed of less account than the least, on land and sea; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  His body, too, borne hither and thither on the billows with much insolence, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With none to bury him, because He had rejected him with dishonour. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He reflected not that he was man, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And reflected not on the latter end; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  He said: I will be lord of land and sea; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he recognized not that it is God who is great, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mighty in His great strength. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  He is king over the heavens, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And judgeth kings and kingdoms. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  It is He who setteth me up in glory, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bringeth down the proud to eternal destruction in dishonour, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they knew Him not. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And now behold, ye princes of the earth, the judgement of the Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a great king and righteous is He, judging all that is under heaven. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Bless God, ye that fear the Lord with wisdom, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mercy of the Lord will ~e upon them that fear Him, m the Judgement; </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  So that He will distinguish between the righteous and the sinner, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And recompense the sinners for ever according to their deeds; </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And have mercy on the righteous, delivering him from the affliction of the sinner, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And recompensing the sinner for what he bath done to the righteous. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  For the Lord is good to them that call upon Him in patience, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing according to His mercy to His pious ones, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing them at all times before Him in strength. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Blessed be the Lord for ever before His servants. </p>
