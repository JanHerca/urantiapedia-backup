<p> <i>“They set a worldly monarchy . . . . they lay waste the Throne of David!” A poetic narrative about the utter disintegration of a great nation.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Lord, Thou art our King for ever and ever, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For in Thee, O God, doth our soul glory. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  How long are the days of man's life upon the earth? </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As are his days, so is the hope set upon him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But we hope in God, our deliverer; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For the might of our God is for ever with mercy, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the kingdom of our God is for ever over the nations in judgement. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou, O Lord, didst choose David to be king over Israel, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And swaredst to him touching his seed that never should his kingdom fail before Thee. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But, for our sins, sinners rose up against us; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They assailed us and thrust us out; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Thou hadst not promised to them, they took away from us with violence. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They in no wise glorified Thy honourable name; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set a worldly monarchy in place of that which was their excellency; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laid waste the throne of David in tumultuous arrogance. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But Thou, O God, didst cast them down, and remove their seed from the earth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that there rose up against them a man that was alien to our race. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  According to their sins didst Thou recompense them, O God; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that it befell them according to their deeds. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  God showed them no pity; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sought out their seed and let not one of them go free. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Faithful is the Lord in all His judgements </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which He doeth upon the earth. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The lawless one laid waste our land so that none inhabited it, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They destroyed young and old and their children together. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In the heat of His anger He sent them away even unto the west, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And He exposed the rulers of the land unsparingly to derision. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Being an alien the enemy acted proudly, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his heart was alien from Our God. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As also the nations in the cities to their gods. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the children of the covenant in the midst of the mingled peoples surpassed them in evil. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not among them one that wrought in the midst of Jerusalem mercy and truth. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They that loved the synagogues of the pious fled from them, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As sparrows that fly from their nest. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They wandered in deserts that their lives might be saved from harm, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And precious in the eyes of them that lived abroad was any that escaped alive from them. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the whole earth were they scattered by lawless men. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For the heavens withheld the rain from dropping upon the earth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Springs were stopped that sprang perennially out of the deeps, that ran down from lofty mountains. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For there was none among them that wrought righteousness and justice; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the chief of them to the least of them all were sinful; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king was a transgressor, and the judge disobedient, and the people sinful. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample her down to destruction. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Wisely, righteously he shall thrust out sinners from the inheritance, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall destroy the pride of the sinner as a potter's vessel. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  With a rod of iron he shall break in pieces all their substance, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall destroy the godless nations with the word of his mouth; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  At his rebuke nations shall flee before him, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shall reprove sinners for the thoughts of their heart. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And he shall gather together a holy people, whom he shall lead in righteousness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shall judge the tribes of the people that has been sanctified by the Lord his God. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And he shall not suffer unrighteousness to lodge any more in their midst, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shall there dwell with them any man that knoweth wickedness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he shall know them, that they are all sons of their God. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he shall divide them according to their tribes upon the land, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And neither sojourner nor alien shall sojourn with them any more. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He shall judge peoples and nations in the wisdom of his righteousness. Selah. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And he shall have the heathen nations to serve him under his yoke; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shall glorify the Lord in a place to be seen of all the earth; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shall purge Jerusalem, making it holy as of old: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  So that nations shall come from the ends of the earth to see his glory, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing as gifts her sons who had fainted. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to see the glory of the Lord, wherewith God hath glorified her. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And he shall be a righteous king, taught of God, over them, </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And there shall be no unrighteousness in his days in their midst, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all shall be holy and their king the anointed of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For he shall not put his trust in horse and rider and bow, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shall he multiply for himself gold and silver for war, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Nor shall he gather confidence from a multitude for the day of battle. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  The Lord Himself is his king, the hope of him that is mighty through his hope in God. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  All nations shall be in fear before him, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth for ever. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  He will bless the people of the Lord with wisdom and gladness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he himself will be pure from sin, so that he may rule a great people. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  He will rebuke rulers, and remove sinners by the might of his word; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And relying upon his God, throughout his days he will not stumble; </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  For God will make him mighty by means of His holy spirit, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wise by means of the spirit of understanding, with strength and righteousness. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And the blessing of the Lord will be with him: he will be strong and stumble not; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hope will be in the Lord: who then can prevail against him? </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  He will, be mighty in his works, and strong in the fear of God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  He will lead them all aright, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  This will be the majesty of the king of Israel whom God knoweth; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will raise him up over the house of Israel to correct him. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  His words shall be more refined than costly gold, the choicest; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the assemblies he will judge the peoples, the tribes of the sanctified. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  His words shall be like the words of the holy ones in the midst of sanctified peoples. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  Blessed be they that shall be in those days, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass in the gathering together of the tribes. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel! </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May He deliver us from the uncleanness of unholy enemies! </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever. </p>
