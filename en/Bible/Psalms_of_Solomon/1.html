<p> <i>“They became insolent in their prosperity . . . .”</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I cried unto the Lord when I was in distress, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto God when sinners assailed. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Suddenly the alarm of war was heard before me; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, He will hearken to me for I am full of righteousness. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I thought in my heart that I was full of righteousness, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I was well off and had become rich in children. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Their wealth spread to the whole earth, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their glory unto the end of the earth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They were exalted unto the stars; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they would never fan. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But they became insolent in their prosperity, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they were without understanding, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Their sins were in secret, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even I had no knowledge of them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Their transgressions went beyond those of the heathen before them; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They utterly polluted the holy things of the Lord. </p>
