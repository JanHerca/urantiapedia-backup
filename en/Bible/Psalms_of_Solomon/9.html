<p> <i>The exile of the tribes of Israel. A reference to the covenant which God made with Adam. (See the First Book of Adam and Eve, Chap. III, Verse 7).</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Israel was led away captive into a strange land, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they fell away from the Lord who redeemed them, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were cast away from the inheritance, which the Lord had given them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Among every nation were the dispersed of Israel according to the word of God, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Thou mightest be justified, O God, in Thy righteousness by reason of our transgressions: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou art a just judge over all the peoples of the earth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For from Thy knowledge none that doeth unjustly is hidden, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the righteous deeds of Thy pious ones are before Thee, O Lord; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, then, can a man hide himself from Thy knowledge, O God? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Our works are subject to our own choice and power </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do right or wrong in the works of our hands; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in Thy righteousness Thou visitest the sons of men. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He that doeth righteousness layeth up life for himself with the Lord; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that doeth wrongly forfeits his life to destruction; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the judgements of the Lord are given in righteousness to every man and his house. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Unto whom art Thou good, O God, except to them that call upon the Lord? </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cleanseth from sins a soul when it maketh confession, when it maketh acknowledgement; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For shame is upon us and u on our faces on account of all these things. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And to whom doth He forgive sins, except to them that have sinned? </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou blessest the righteous, and dost not reprove them for the sins that they have committed; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thy goodness is upon them that sin, when they repent. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And, now, Thou art our God, and we the people whom Thou hast loved: </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold and show pity, O God of Israel, for we are Thine; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And remove not Thy mercy from us, lest they assail us. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For Thou didst choose the seed of Abraham before all the nations, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And didst set Thy name upon us, O Lord, </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thou wilt not reject us for ever. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou madest a covenant with our fathers concerning us; </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we hope in Thee, when our soul turneth unto Thee. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mercy of the Lord be upon the house of Israel for ever and ever. </p>
