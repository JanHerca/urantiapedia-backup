<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In like manner, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  beholding your chaste behavior [coupled] with fear. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whose [adorning] let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [apparel] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with [your wives] according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Finally, [be] ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But even if ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye:] and fear not their fear, neither be troubled; <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: [being] ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  which also after a true likeness doth now save you, [even] baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  who is one the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
