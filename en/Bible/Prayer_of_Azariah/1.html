<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord : praise and exalt him above all for ever, </p>
