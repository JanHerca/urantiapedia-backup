<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name [of Jehovah], shall be put to death. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses. </p>
