<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah's passover. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah]: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah. </p>
