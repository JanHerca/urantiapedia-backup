<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And he presented the people's oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
