<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar): </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen! </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished! </p>
