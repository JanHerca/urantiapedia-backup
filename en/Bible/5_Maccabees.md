## Description

“5 Maccabees”

_From “The Five Books of Maccabees in English”,  Henry Cotton, Oxford at The University Press (1832)_

The Fifth Book of the Maccabees is an ancient Jewish work relating the history in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.

The book chronicles the events from Heliodorus' attempt to rob the Temple treasury in 186 BC to the death of Herod the Great's two sons about 6 BC.

Similar to other Books of the Maccabees, this work aims at consoling Jews in their sufferings and encouraging them to be steadfast “in their devotion to the Mosaic law”.

James Charlesworth writes (_The Pseudepigrapha and Modern Research_, pp. 153-156):

> This book is extant in unedited Karshuni (Borg. syr. 28, ff. 412v-482v of A.D. 1581; Par. syr. 3, ff. 92v-116v \[?\] of A.D. 1695; Vien. or. 1548, ff. 20r-199r of A.D. 1729 \[Karshuni or Syriac?\]) and Arabic manuscripts (Vat. ar. 468, ff. 718v-759v of A.D. 1579; Vat. syr. 461, ff. 831-888 of A.D. 1667; Leningrad, Collection of Gregory IV. Nr. 3 \[?\]; and Leningrad, Collection of Gregory IV. Nr. 18, ff. 69-78 of A.D. 1642). The Arabic manuscript listed first was probably (so G. Graf, _Geschichte_, vol. 1, p. 223) the text behind G. Sionita's edition (in Le Jay's Polyglotte de Paris, 1645. Vol. 9, pp. 1-76 at the end; repr. in Walton's London Polyglotta, 1657. Vol. 4, pp. 112-59). An English translation, unfortunately made “from the Latin version of the Arabic text printed in the Polyglotts,” was published by H. Cotton (_The Five Books of Maccabees_. Oxford: OUP, 1832; see esp. pp. xxx-xxxv, 227-446).
> 
> The crucial question regarding this work, which is virtually unknown to scholars, is its date. While Graf (_Geschichte_, vol. 1, p. 223) suggested it originated in early Melchite circles, Cotton (p. xxxii) and E. Beurlier (“Machabées \[Livres apocryphes des\],” _DB_ 4, col. 502) concluded that the book was written in the latter part of the first century.
> 
> A date in the early Middle Ages appeared likely until the lack of later tendencies and ideas became noticeable, along with the recognition of early expressions (viz., “the third house,” 22:9), the mention of the destruction of Jerusalem (9:5, 21:30), and the impossibility of concluding that it is a pasticcio of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Maccabees and Josephus' _Antiquities_ and _Wars_. It is wise to remain skeptical about the possibility of a late first century A.D. date for the work, although the intrinsic evidence presently appears to point in that direction.
> 
> The author of 5 Maccabees used other sources besides the works attributed to the Maccabees and Josephus' writings. Is it possible that this document preserves portions of the books written by Jason of Cyrene, Justus of Tiberias, or Nicolaus of Damascus? This question needs examination along with another; what is the relation between 5 Maccabees and the medieval Hebrew chronicle of Jewish history called Josippon? D. Flusser has completed a critical edition of the Hebrew text, which is now with the printer.
> 
> An important link between 5 Maccabees and Nicolaus of Damascus is that both, against Josephus (_Wars_ 1.6, 2) and others (e.g. Hegesippus), claim that Antipater, Herod's father, was not an Idumaean, but a Jew who had come from Babylonia with Ezra (cf. 5Mac 35:1 with Josippon 37).
> 
> Is 5 Maccabees an epitome of the Josippon, as Graf contended (p. 223)? It is tempting to dismiss so-called 5 Maccabees from the Pseudepigrpaha and assume it is derived from the late Jewish Josippon. This attribution would solve some problems and explain why specialists of the Pseudepigrapha and of Josippon do not discuss or mention 5 Maccabees (e.g. it is mentioned neither in J. Strugnell's “Josippon,” _NCE_ 7, p. 1124, nor in A. A. Neuman's “Josippon and the Apocrypha,” _Landmarks and Goals_. Philadelphia: Dropsie, 1953; pp. 35-59). The acid test is always the sources themselves, and the manuscripts of 5 Maccabees and of Josippon resist a simple explanation of their relationship. 5 Maccabees, moreover, is dissimilar from the Arabic epitomes of Josippon (it is extremely different from the text edited and translated by M. Sanders and H. Nahmad; cf. their “A Judeo-Arabic Epitome of the Yosippon,” _Essays in Honor of Solomon B. Freehof_, eds. W. Jacob, _et al_. Pittsburgh: Rodef Shalom Congregation, 1964; pp. 275-99). Since neither the Arabic of 5 Maccabees nor the Hebrew of Josippon was available, Cotton's translation of 5 Maccabees was juxtaposed with J. Wellhausen's translation of Josippon (_Der arabische Josippus_ \[Abhand. der Königl. Gesell. d. Wiss. z. Göttingen, Philol.-Hist. Klasse, n. F. 1, 4\] Berlin: Weidmann, 1897). The comparison did not suggest that 5 Maccabees derives from Josippon. Any conclusion, however, must be unusually cautious since no reliable edition exists of either text. It is also difficult to conclude that 5 Maccabees is an abbreviated version of Josippon, because it is a longer text yet covers only a portion of the history represented in Josippon, which begins with Alexander the Great and concludes with the capture of Masada in A.D. 73.
> 
> Additional evidence that a relationship exists between 5 Maccabees and Josippon is that both interrupt, though with substantial differences, the chronology from Heliodorus to Antiochus IV by inserting an account of the translation of the Septuagint for Ptolemy. A significantly shared feature is the identification of the famous martyr Eleazar as one of the seventy translators.
> 
> Without having completed a detailed research on the relationships of 5 Maccabees with the other Maccabean books, with Josephus' two works, and with Josippon, one should not suggest a theory. A tentative hypothesis, which is similar to those suggested by Wellhausen (p. 47) and Beurlier (cols. 502f.), may be proposed: perhaps 5 Maccabees is a late first-century A.D. compilation of early documents, some now lost, and of a few new sections; this compilation was later epitomized along with other texts by the author of the Josippon.
> 
> Beurlier (col. 502) thought that the original language of the book is Hebrew. This possibility is enhanced by numerous Semitisms that suggest a Hebrew _Vorlage_. It is difficult to prove this hypothesis since some of the Semitisms could have been introduced in the transmission of the Karahuni and and Arabic texts. A note in some Arabic manuscripts at the end of the first sixteen chapters, however, reports that this section had been translated from Hebrew.
> 
> 5 Maccabees is a chronicle of Jewish history from Heliodorus' attempt to rob the Temple treasury in the early decades of the second century B.C. to the death of Herod the Great's two sons about 6 B.C.—with an interpolation relating Eleazar's role in translating the Septuagint, as well as other interesting expansions (viz. the futile prayer of Antiochus Epiphanes, chp. 8). The work is bifurcated internally: the first section, 1:1-16:26, relates the history from Heliodorus to the death of Nicanor which is called “The Second Book of the Maccabees According to the Translation of the Hebrews”; 17:1-59:96, the second section, is the history from the war between the Roman Scipio and the Carthaginian King Hannibal to the murder of the sons Alexander and Aristobulus, which is called “The Second Book of Maccabees” (cf. the preface in the Polyglotte de Paris).

## About included edition

This work is not included in Charlesworth's _The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha_ and has been obtained from early translations of Henry Cotton in 1832.

The book from Cotton is prefaced with this information:

> A Record Of Events From The Translation Of The Hebrew Scriptures Into Greek Under Ptolemy Philadelphus, (B.C. 277,) To The Death Of Herod’S Two Sons, In The Fifth Or Sixth Year Before Christ. 
> 
> 
> PREFACE (from the Paris Polyglott Bible.) 
> 
> 
> This book, from the first to the sixteenth chapter inclusive, is entitled, “The Second Book of Maccabees according to the translation of the Hebrews,” as may be seen at the end of ch. xvi. The remainder of it is entitled simply, “The Second Book of Maccabees,” the series of chapters being continued from the preceding portion. But, since the work agrees neither with the Syriac text, which is considered of the highest authority among the Orientals, nor with the Greek, nor with the Vulgate version, (although it exists in almost all the Oriental manuscripts), we have placed it at the end of this Bible, and moreover without its points: both, that it may not be supposed by any one that we include it among the canonical books; and also, because the Second Book of Maccabees, which is reckoned canonical, still remains to us entire, though under the name of “The First Book.” 
> 
> You have however in this book some particulars extracted from the first and from the second : also some others which perhaps have never yet been made public; which we trust may not be without some degree of pleasure to you: inasmuch as the entire book is a sort of continuation of the history, carried down from the very Maccabees to the reign of Herod and the government of Pilate a and consequently to the time of Christ our Lord. 
> 
> Lastly, we wish you to understand that we have copied the text with that scrupulous exactness, that we have not changed even those things which easily might have been altered for the better.
