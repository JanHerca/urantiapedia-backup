## Prologue


<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Phocylides, the wisest of men, sets forth 

<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  these counsels of God by his holy judgments, gifts of blessing.

## Summary of the Decalogue 

<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Neither commit adultery nor rouse homosexual passion. 

<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Neither devise treachery nor stain your hands with blood. 

<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Do not become rich unjustly, but live from honorable means.

<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Be content with what you have and abstain from what is another’s.

<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Do not tell lies, but always speak the truth. 

<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Honor God foremost, and afterward your parents.

## Exhortation to justice 

<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Always dispense justice and let not your judgment be influenced by favor. 

<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Do not cast down the poor unjustly, do not judge partially.

<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  If you judge evilly, subsequently God will judge you.

<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Flee false witness; award what is just. 

<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Watch over a deposit, and in everything keep faith. 

<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Give a just measure, and an extra full measure of all things is good. 

<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Do not make a balance unequal, but weigh honestly. 

<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  And do not commit perjury, neither ignorantly nor willingly. 

<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  The immortal God hates a perjurer, whosoever it is who has sworn. 

<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Do not steal seeds. Cursed is whosoever takes (them). 

<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Give the laborer his pay, do not afflict the poor. 

<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Take heed of your tongue, keep your word hidden in (your) heart. 

<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Neither wish to do injustice, nor therefore allow another to do injustice. 

## Admonition to mercy 

<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Give to the poor man at once, and do not tell him to come tomorrow. 

<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  You must fill your hand. Give alms to the needy. 

<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Receive the homeless in (your) house, and lead the blind man. 

<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Pity the shipwrecked, for navigation is unsure. 

<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Extend your hand to him who falls, and save the helpless one. 

<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  Suffering is common to all; life is a wheel; prosperity is unstable.

<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  When you have wealth, stretch out your hand to the poor. 

<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  Of that which God has given you, give of it to the needy. 

<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Let all of life be in common, and all things be in agreement.

<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  [Do not eat blood; abstain from what is sacrificed to idols.] 

<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Put on a sword, not for bloodshed but for protection. 

<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  But may you not need it at all, neither outside the law nor justly. 

<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  For if you kill an enemy, you stain your hand.

<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Keep off the field of your neighbor, and therefore do not be a trespasser. 

<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Moderation is the best of all, and excesses are grievous.

<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  [Lawful acquisition is useful, but unjust acquisition is bad.] 

<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  Do not damage fruits that are growing on the land. 

<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Strangers should be held in equal honor among citizens. 

<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  For we all experience the poverty of much wandering.

<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And the land of the country has nothing steadfast for men. 

## Love of money and its consequences 

<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  The love of money is the mother of all evil. 

<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Gold and silver are always a lure for men. 

<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Gold, originator of evil, destroyer of life, crushing all things, 

<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  would that you were not a desirable calamity to mortals!

<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  For your sake there are battles and plunderings and murders, 

<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  and children become the enemies of their parents, and brothers (the enemies) of their kinsmen.

## Honesty, modesty, and self-control 

<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  Do not hide a different thought in your heart while uttering another. 

<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Change not yourself according to the spot, like a polyp that clings to the rock.

<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  Be sincere? to all, speak what is from your soul. 

<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  Whoever wrongs willfully is a bad man; but if he does so under compulsion, 

<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  I shall not pass sentence, for it is each man’s intention that is examined. 

<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Do not pride yourself on wisdom nor on strength nor on riches.: 

<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  The only God is wise and mighty and at the same time rich in blessings. 

<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  Do not afflict your heart? with yeon evils; 

<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  for what has been done can no more be undone. 

<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  Do not be rash with (your) hands, but bridle your wild anger. 

<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  For often someone who has dealt a blow has unintentionally committed a murder.

## Moderation in all things 

<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  Let (your) emotions be moderate, neither great nor overwhelming. 

<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  Excess, even of good, is never a boon to mortals; 

<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  and a great luxuriousness draws one to immoderate desires. 

<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  Great wealth is conceited and grows to insolence. 

<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  Anger that steals over one causes destructive madness. 

<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  Rage is a desire, but wrath surpasses (it). 

<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  Zeal for good things is noble, but (zeal for) bad things (is) excessive.

<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  Daring in bad deeds is ruinous, but greatly helps a man who works at good deeds.

<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  Love of virtue is worthy, but love of passion increases shame. 

<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  A man who is too naïve is called foolish among the citizens. 

<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  Eat in moderation, and drink and tell stories in moderation. 

<span id="v69b"><sup><small>69b</small></sup></span>  Moderation is the best of all, excesses are grievous. 


## Danger of envy and other vices 

<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  Do not envy (your) friends their goods, do not fix reproach (upon them). 

<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  The heavenly ones? also are without envy toward each other. 

<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  The moon does not envy the much stronger beams of the sun, 

<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  nor the earth the heavenly heights though it is below, 

<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  nor the rivers the seas. They are always. in concord. 

<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  For if there were strife among the blessed ones, heaven would not stand firm.

<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  Practice self-restraint, and abstain from shameful deeds. 

<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  Do not imitate evil, but leave vengeance to justice. 

<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  For persuasiveness is a blessing, but strife begets only strife. 

<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  Trust not too quickly, before you can see exactly the end. 

<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  It is proper to surpass (your) benefactors with still more (benefactions). 

<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  It is better to entertain guests with a simple meal quickly 

<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  than extensive festivity drawn out beyond the right time. 

<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  Never be a relentless creditor to a poor man. 

<span id="v84"><sup><small>84</small></sup></span>  One should not take from a nest all the birds together, 

<span id="v85"><sup><small>85</small></sup></span>  but leave the mother bird behind, in order to get young from her again.

<span id="v86"><sup><small>86</small></sup></span>  Never allow ignorant men to sit in judgment. 

<span id="v87"><sup><small>87</small></sup></span>  [Do not pass a judgment before you have heard the word of both parties.]

<span id="v88"><sup><small>88</small></sup></span>  A wise man examines wisdom, and a fellow craftsman (examines) crafts.

<span id="v89"><sup><small>89</small></sup></span>  An untrained ear cannot grasp important teaching; 

<span id="v90"><sup><small>90</small></sup></span>  for those who have never learned good things do not understand.

<span id="v91"><sup><small>91</small></sup></span>  Do not make parasitic flatterers your friends. 

<span id="v92"><sup><small>92</small></sup></span>  For many are friends of drinking and eating, 

<span id="v93"><sup><small>93</small></sup></span>  flattering at a time whenever they can satiate themselves, 

<span id="v94"><sup><small>94</small></sup></span>  but all being discontented with little and unsatiated with much. 

<span id="v95"><sup><small>95</small></sup></span>  Trust not the people; the mob is fickle; 

<span id="v96"><sup><small>96</small></sup></span>  for the people and water and fire are all equally uncontrollable.' 


## Death and afterlife 

<span id="v97"><sup><small>97</small></sup></span>  Sit not in vain at the fire, weakening your heart. 

<span id="v98"><sup><small>98</small></sup></span>  Be moderate in your grief; for moderation is the best. 

<span id="v99"><sup><small>99</small></sup></span>  Let the unburied dead receive their share of the earth.

<span id="v100"><sup><small>100</small></sup></span>  Do not dig up the grave of the deceased, nor expose to the sun 

<span id="v101"><sup><small>101</small></sup></span>  what may not be seen, lest you stir up the divine anger.

<span id="v102"><sup><small>102</small></sup></span>  It is not good to dissolve the human frame; 

<span id="v103"><sup><small>103</small></sup></span>  for we hope that the remains of the departed will soon come to the light (again) 

<span id="v104"><sup><small>104</small></sup></span>  out of the earth;! and afterward they will become gods.

<span id="v105"><sup><small>105</small></sup></span>  For the souls remain unharmed among the deceased. 

<span id="v106"><sup><small>106</small></sup></span>  For the spirit is a loan of God to mortals, and (his) image.

<span id="v107"><sup><small>107</small></sup></span>  For we have a body out of earth, and when afterward we are resolved again into earth 

<span id="v108"><sup><small>108</small></sup></span>  we are but dust; and then the air has received our spirit.

<span id="v109"><sup><small>109</small></sup></span>  When you are rich, do not be sparing; remember that you are mortal. 

<span id="v110"><sup><small>110</small></sup></span>  It is impossible to take riches and money (with you) into Hades. 

<span id="v111"><sup><small>111</small></sup></span>  All alike are corpses, but God rules over the souls. 

<span id="v112"><sup><small>112</small></sup></span>  Hades is (our) common eternal home and fatherland, 

<span id="v113"><sup><small>113</small></sup></span>  a common place for all, poor and kings. 

<span id="v114"><sup><small>114</small></sup></span>  We humans live not a long time but for a season. 

<span id="v115"><sup><small>115</small></sup></span>  But (our) soul is immortal and lives ageless forever.! 


## The instability of life

<span id="v116"><sup><small>116</small></sup></span>  [Nobody knows what will be after tomorrow. or after an hour. 

<span id="v117"><sup><small>117</small></sup></span>  Death is heedless of mortals, and the future is uncertain.

<span id="v118"><sup><small>118</small></sup></span>  Do not let evils dismay you nor therefore exult in success.

<span id="v119"><sup><small>119</small></sup></span>  Many times in life incredible calamity has come suddenly 

<span id="v120"><sup><small>120</small></sup></span>  to the confident and release from evil to the vexed.

<span id="v121"><sup><small>121</small></sup></span>  Accommodate yourself to the circumstances, do not blow against the winds. 


## Speech and wisdom, man’s distinction 

<span id="v122"><sup><small>122</small></sup></span>  Do not become mad in your mind by reveling in boastfulness. 

<span id="v123"><sup><small>123</small></sup></span>  Practice speaking the right word, which will greatly benefit all. 

<span id="v124"><sup><small>124</small></sup></span>  Speech is to man a weapon sharper than iron. 

<span id="v125"><sup><small>125</small></sup></span>  God allotted a weapon to every creature; the capacity to fly 

<span id="v126"><sup><small>126</small></sup></span>  to birds, speed to horses, and strength to the lions; 

<span id="v127"><sup><small>127</small></sup></span>  he clothed the bulls with their self-growing horns, he gave stings to the bees 

<span id="v128"><sup><small>128</small></sup></span>  as their natural means of defense, but speech to man as his protection. 

<span id="v129"><sup><small>129</small></sup></span>  [But speech of the divinely inspired wisdom is best.]

<span id="v130"><sup><small>130</small></sup></span>  Better is a wise man than a strong one. 

<span id="v131"><sup><small>131</small></sup></span>  Wisdom directs the course of lands and cities and ships.

## Avoidance of wickedness and the life of self-restraint and virtue 


<span id="v132"><sup><small>132</small></sup></span>  It is unholy to hide a wicked man so as to prevent his being brought to trial; 

<span id="v133"><sup><small>133</small></sup></span>  but one must return an evildoer forcibly. 

<span id="v134"><sup><small>134</small></sup></span>  Those who are with the wicked often die with them.

<span id="v135"><sup><small>135</small></sup></span>  Do not accept from thieves a stolen, unlawful deposit. 

<span id="v136"><sup><small>136</small></sup></span>  Both are thieves, the one who receives as well as the one who steals. 

<span id="v137"><sup><small>137</small></sup></span>  Render to all their due, and impartiality is best in every way. 

<span id="v138"><sup><small>138</small></sup></span>  In the beginning be sparing with all things, lest in the end you fall short. 

<span id="v139"><sup><small>139</small></sup></span>  Take not for yourself a mortal beast’s ration of food.

<span id="v140"><sup><small>140</small></sup></span>  But if a beast of (your) enemy falls on the way, help it to rise.

<span id="v141"><sup><small>141</small></sup></span>  Never expose a wandering man and a sinner.

<span id="v142"><sup><small>142</small></sup></span>  It is better to make a gracious friend instead of an enemy. 

<span id="v143"><sup><small>143</small></sup></span>  Nip the evil in the bud, and heal the wound. 

<span id="v144"><sup><small>144</small></sup></span>  [By a tiny spark a vast forest is set on fire.]

<span id="v145"><sup><small>145</small></sup></span>  [Keep your heart restrained and abstain from disgraceful things.] 

<span id="v146"><sup><small>146</small></sup></span>  [Flee an evil report; flee lawless men. ]

<span id="v147"><sup><small>147</small></sup></span>  Eat no meat that is torn by wild animals, but leave the remains 

<span id="v148"><sup><small>148</small></sup></span>  to the swift dogs. Animals eat from animals. 

<span id="v149"><sup><small>149</small></sup></span>  Make no potions, keep away from magical books. 

<span id="v150"><sup><small>150</small></sup></span>  Do not apply your hand violently to tender children.

<span id="v151"><sup><small>151</small></sup></span>  Flee dissension and strife when war is drawing near. 

<span id="v152"><sup><small>152</small></sup></span>  Do no good to a bad man; it is like sowing into the sea.' 


## The usefulness of labor? 

<span id="v153"><sup><small>153</small></sup></span>  Work hard so that you can live from your own means; 

<span id="v154"><sup><small>154</small></sup></span>  for every idle man lives from what his hands can steal.

<span id="v155"><sup><small>155</small></sup></span>  [A craft maintains a man, but an idle man is oppressed by hunger. ]

<span id="v156"><sup><small>156</small></sup></span>  Eat not the leavings of another man’s meal, 

<span id="v157"><sup><small>157</small></sup></span>  but eat without shame what you have earned yourself. 

<span id="v158"><sup><small>158</small></sup></span>  And if someone has not learned a craft, he must dig with a hoe. 

<span id="v159"><sup><small>159</small></sup></span>  Life has every kind of work if you are willing to toil. 

<span id="v160"><sup><small>160</small></sup></span>  If you want to sail and be a mariner, the sea is wide. 

<span id="v161"><sup><small>161</small></sup></span>  And if you want to cultivate land, the fields are large.

<span id="v162"><sup><small>162</small></sup></span>  There is no easy work without toil, (neither) for men,nor for the blessed themselves.

<span id="v163"><sup><small>163</small></sup></span>  But labor gives great increase to virtue. 

<span id="v164"><sup><small>164</small></sup></span>  The ants having left their homes, deeply hidden under the earth, 

<span id="v165"><sup><small>165</small></sup></span>  come in their need of food when the fields 

<span id="v166"><sup><small>166</small></sup></span>  fill the threshing floors with fruits after the crops have been reaped. 

<span id="v167"><sup><small>167</small></sup></span>  They themselves have a load of freshly threshed wheat 

<span id="v168"><sup><small>168</small></sup></span>  or barley—and always bearer follows bearer— 

<span id="v169"><sup><small>169</small></sup></span>  and from the summer harvest they supply their food for the winter, 

<span id="v170"><sup><small>170</small></sup></span>  without tiring. This tiny folk is much-laboring.

<span id="v171"><sup><small>171</small></sup></span>  The bee toils, traversing the air, working excellently, 

<span id="v172"><sup><small>172</small></sup></span>  whether in the crevice of a hollow rock or in the reeds, 

<span id="v173"><sup><small>173</small></sup></span>  or in the hollow of an ancient oak, within their nests, 

<span id="v174"><sup><small>174</small></sup></span>  in swarms at their thousand-celled combs, building with wax.


## Marriage and chastity

<span id="v175"><sup><small>175</small></sup></span>  Do not remain unmarried, lest you die nameless. 

<span id="v176"><sup><small>176</small></sup></span>  Give nature her due, you also, beget in your turn as you were begotten.

<span id="v177"><sup><small>177</small></sup></span>  Do not prostitute your wife, defiling your children. 

<span id="v178"><sup><small>178</small></sup></span>  For the adulterous bed brings not sons in (your) likeness.

<span id="v179"><sup><small>179</small></sup></span>  Do not touch your stepmother, your father’s second wife,

<span id="v180"><sup><small>180</small></sup></span>  but honor her as a mother, because she follows the footsteps of your mother. 

<span id="v181"><sup><small>181</small></sup></span>  Do not have intercourse with the concubines of (your) father.

<span id="v182"><sup><small>182</small></sup></span>  Do not approach the bed of (your) sister, (a bed) to turn away from.

<span id="v183"><sup><small>183</small></sup></span>  Nor go to bed with the wives of your brothers.

<span id="v184"><sup><small>184</small></sup></span>  Do not let a woman destroy the unborn babe in her belly, 

<span id="v185"><sup><small>185</small></sup></span>  nor after its birth throw it before the dogs and the vultures as a prey.

<span id="v186"><sup><small>186</small></sup></span>  Do not lay your hand upon your wife when she is pregnant.

<span id="v187"><sup><small>187</small></sup></span>  Do not cut a youth’s masculine procreative faculty. 

<span id="v188"><sup><small>188</small></sup></span>  Do not seek sexual union with irrational animals.

<span id="v189"><sup><small>189</small></sup></span>  Do not outrage (your) wife by shameful ways of intercourse.

<span id="v190"><sup><small>190</small></sup></span>  Do not transgress with unlawful sex the limits set by nature.

<span id="v191"><sup><small>191</small></sup></span>  For even animals are not pleased by intercourse of male with male. 

<span id="v192"><sup><small>192</small></sup></span>  And let women not imitate the sexual role of men. 

<span id="v193"><sup><small>193</small></sup></span>  Do not surrender wholly to unbridled sensuality toward (your) wife.

<span id="v194"><sup><small>194</small></sup></span>  For eros is not a god,but a passion destructive of all. 

<span id="v195"><sup><small>195</small></sup></span>  Love your own wife, for what is sweeter and better 

<span id="v196"><sup><small>196</small></sup></span>  than whenever a wife is kindly disposed toward (her) husband and a husband toward (his) wife 

<span id="v197"><sup><small>197</small></sup></span>  till old age, without strife divisively interfering?

<span id="v198"><sup><small>198</small></sup></span>  Let no one violently have intercourse with a girl not yet betrothed. 

<span id="v199"><sup><small>199</small></sup></span>  Do not bring as a wife into your home a bad and wealthy woman, 

<span id="v200"><sup><small>200</small></sup></span>  for you will be a slave of (your) wife because of the ruinous dowry.

<span id="v201"><sup><small>201</small></sup></span>  We seek noble horses and strong-necked bulls, 

<span id="v202"><sup><small>202</small></sup></span>  plowers of the earth, and the very best of dogs; 

<span id="v203"><sup><small>203</small></sup></span>  yet we fools do not strive to marry a good (wife), 

<span id="v204"><sup><small>204</small></sup></span>  nor does a woman reject a bad man when he is rich.

<span id="v205"><sup><small>205</small></sup></span>  Do not add marriage to marriage, calamity to calamity.

<span id="v206"><sup><small>206</small></sup></span>  Nor permit yourself strife with your kinsfolk about possessions. 


## Family life 

<span id="v207"><sup><small>207</small></sup></span>  Do not be harsh with your children, but be gentle. 

<span id="v208"><sup><small>208</small></sup></span>  And if a child offends against you, let the mother cut her son down to size, 

<span id="v209"><sup><small>209</small></sup></span>  or else the elders of the family or the chiefs of the people.

<span id="v210"><sup><small>210</small></sup></span>  If a child is a boy do not let locks grow on (his) head. 

<span id="v211"><sup><small>211</small></sup></span>  Do not braid (his) crown nor the cross knots at the top of his head. 

<span id="v212"><sup><small>212</small></sup></span>  Long hair is not fit for boys, but for voluptuous women.» 

<span id="v213"><sup><small>213</small></sup></span>  Guard the youthful prime of life of a comely boy, 

<span id="v214"><sup><small>214</small></sup></span>  because many rage for intercourse with a man. 

<span id="v215"><sup><small>215</small></sup></span>  Guard a virgin in firmly locked rooms,

<span id="v216"><sup><small>216</small></sup></span>  and do not let her be seen before the house until her wedding day. 

<span id="v217"><sup><small>217</small></sup></span>  The beauty of children is hard for their parents to guard. 

<span id="v218"><sup><small>218</small></sup></span>  [Love your friends till death, for faithfulness is a good thing.]

<span id="v219"><sup><small>219</small></sup></span>  Show love to your kinsmen and holy unanimity. — 

<span id="v220"><sup><small>220</small></sup></span>  Revere those with gray hair on the temples and yield your seat 

<span id="v221"><sup><small>221</small></sup></span>  and all privileges to aged persons. An old man of equal descent 

<span id="v222"><sup><small>222</small></sup></span>  and of the same age as your father give the same honors. 

<span id="v223"><sup><small>223</small></sup></span>  Provide your slave with the tribute he owes his stomach.

<span id="v224"><sup><small>224</small></sup></span>  Apportion to a slave what is appointed so that he will be as you wish.

<span id="v225"><sup><small>225</small></sup></span>  Do not brand (your) slave, thus insulting him. 

<span id="v226"><sup><small>226</small></sup></span>  Do not hurt a slave by slandering (him) to (his) master.' 

<span id="v227"><sup><small>227</small></sup></span>  Accept advice also from a judicious slave. 


## Epilogue 


<span id="v228"><sup><small>228</small></sup></span>  Purifications are for the purity of the soul, not of the body. 

<span id="v229"><sup><small>229</small></sup></span>  These are the mysteries of righteousness; living thus 

<span id="v230"><sup><small>230</small></sup></span>  may you live out (your) life well to the threshold of old age.
