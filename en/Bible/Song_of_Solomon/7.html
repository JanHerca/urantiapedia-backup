<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skilful workman. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thy body is [like] a round goblet, [Wherein] no mingled wine is wanting: Thy waist is [like] a heap of wheat Set about with lilies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes [as] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses [thereof]. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I am my beloved's; And his desire is toward me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, [And] its blossom is open, [And] the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. </p>
