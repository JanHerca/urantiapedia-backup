<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  My dove, my undefiled, is [but] one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; [Yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, [And] the pomegranates were in flower. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Before I was aware, my soul set me [Among] the chariots of my princely people. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim? </p>
