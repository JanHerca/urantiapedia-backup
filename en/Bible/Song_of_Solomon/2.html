<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  His left hand [is] under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, Until he please. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He looketh in at the windows; He glanceth through the lattice. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For, lo, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing [of birds] is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see thy countenance, Let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Take us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  My beloved is mine, and I am his: He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether. </p>
