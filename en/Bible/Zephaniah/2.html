<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed [their flocks] thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand. </p>
