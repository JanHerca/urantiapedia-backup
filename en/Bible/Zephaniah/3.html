<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city! </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, [according to] all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; [to whom] the burden upon her was a reproach. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah. </p>
