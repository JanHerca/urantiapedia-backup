<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  the one [do it] of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. </p>
