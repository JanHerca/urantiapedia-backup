<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ, <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, [even] that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Brethren, I could not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing [I do], forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before, <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  only, whereunto we have attained, by that same [rule] let us walk. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and [whose] glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, [that it may be] conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself. </p>
