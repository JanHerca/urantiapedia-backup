<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after that my grandfather Enoch gave me the teaching of all the secrets in the book in the Parables which had been given to him, and he put them together for me in the words of the book of the Parables. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And on that day Michael answered Raphael and said: “The power of the spirit transports and makes me to tremble because of the severity of the judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels: who can endure the severe judgement which has been executed, and before which they melt away?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Michael answered again, and said to Raphael: “Who is he whose heart is not softened concerning it, and whose reins are not troubled by this word of judgement (that) has gone forth upon them because of those who have thus led them out?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And it came to pass when he stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael said thus to Raphael: “I will not take their part under the eye of the Lord; for the Lord of Spirits has been angry with them because they do as if they were the Lord.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “Therefore all that is hidden shall come upon them for ever and ever; for neither angel nor man shall have his portion (in it), but alone they have received their judgement for ever and ever.” </p>
