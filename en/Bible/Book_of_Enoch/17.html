<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And they took and brought me to a place in which those who were there were like flaming fire, and, when they wished, they appeared as men. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And they brought me to the place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I saw the places of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars and of the thunder and in the uttermost depths, where were a fiery bow and arrows and their quiver, and a fiery sword and all the lightnings. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they took me to the living waters, and to the fire of the west, which receives every setting of the sun. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I came to a river of fire in which the fire flows like water and discharges itself into the great sea towards the west. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I saw the great rivers and came to the great river and to the great darkness, and went to the place where no flesh walks. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I saw the mountains of the darkness of winter and the place whence all the waters of the deep flow. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I saw the mouths of all the rivers of the earth and the mouth of the deep. </p>
