<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven, and I saw how He called them all by their names and they hearkened unto Him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw how they are weighed in a righteous balance according to their proportions of light: (I saw) the width of their spaces and the day of their appearing, and how their revolution produces lightning: and (I saw) their revolution according to the number of the angels, and (how) they keep faith with each other. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I asked the angel who went with me who showed me what was hidden: “What are these?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he said to me: “The Lord of Spirits hath showed thee their parabolic meaning (lit. their parable): these are the names of the holy who dwell on the earth and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.” </p>
