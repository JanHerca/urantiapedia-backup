<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after this I saw another dream, and I will show the whole dream to thee, my son. And Enoch lifted up (his voice) and spake to his son Methuselah: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “To thee, my son, will I speak: hear my words —incline thine ear to the dream-vision of thy father.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “Before I took thy mother Edna, I saw in a vision on my bed, and behold a bull came forth from the earth, and that bull was white; and after it came forth a heifer, and along with this (latter) came forth two bulls, one of them black and the other red.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “And that black bull gored the red one and pursued him over the earth, and thereupon I could no longer see that red bull.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “But that black bull grew and that heifer went with him, and I saw that many oxen proceeded from him which resembled and followed him.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “And that cow, that first one, went from the presence of that first bull in order to seek that red one, but found him not, and lamented with a great lamentation over him and sought him.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “And I looked till that first bull came to her and quieted her, and from that time onward she cried no more.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “And after that she bore another white bull, and after him she bore many bulls and black cows.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “And I saw in my sleep that white bull likewise grow and become a great white bull, and from Him proceeded many white bulls, and they resembled him.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “And they began to beget many white bulls, which resembled them, one following the other, (even) many.” </p>
