<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And from thence I went to the ends of the earth and saw there great beasts, and each differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also differing in appearance and beauty and voice, the one differing from the other. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And to the east of those beasts I saw the ends of the earth whereon the heaven rests, and the portals of the heaven open. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and I counted the portals out of which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets, of each individual star by itself, according to their number and their names, their courses and their positions, and their times and their months, as Uriel the holy angel who was with me showed me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He showed all things to me and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their laws and their companies. </p>
