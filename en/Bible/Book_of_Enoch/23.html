<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw a burning fire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night but (ran) regularly. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I asked saying: “What is this which rests not?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Raguel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered me and said unto me: “This course of fire which thou hast seen is the fire in the west which persecutes all the luminaries of heaven.” </p>
