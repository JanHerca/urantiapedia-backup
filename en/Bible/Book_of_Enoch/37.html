<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The second vision which he saw, the vision of wisdom —which Enoch the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, saw. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I lifted up my voice to speak and say to those which dwell on earth: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “Hear, ye men of old time, and see, ye that come after, the words of the Holy One which I will speak before the Lord of Spirits. It were better to declare (them only) to the men of old time, but even from those that come after we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “Till the present day such wisdom has never been given by the Lord of Spirits as I have received according to my insight, according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits by whom the lot of eternal life has been given to me.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “Now three Parables were imparted to me, and I lifted up my voice and recounted them to those that dwell on the earth.” </p>
