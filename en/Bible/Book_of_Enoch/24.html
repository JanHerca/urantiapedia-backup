<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And from thence I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain range of fire which burnt day and night. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit is beautiful, and its fruit n resembles the dates of a palm. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then I said: “How beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms very delightful in appearance.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then answered Michael, one of the holy and honoured angels who was with me, and was their leader. </p>
