<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And this is the second Parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling of the holy ones and the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And into the heaven they shall not ascend, and on the earth they shall not come: Such shall be the lot of the sinners Who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits, who are thus preserved for the day of suffering and tribulation. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  On that day Mine Elect One shall sit on the throne of glory And shall try their works, and their places of rest shall be innumerable. And their souls shall grow strong within them when they see Mine Elect Ones, and those who have called upon My glorious name: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then will I cause Mine Elect One to dwell among them. And I will transform the heaven and make it an eternal blessing and light </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing: And I will cause Mine elect ones to dwell upon it: But the sinners and evil-doers shall not set foot thereon. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I have provided and satisfied with peace My righteous ones And have caused them to dwell before Me: But for the sinners there is judgement impending with Me, so that I shall destroy them from the face of the earth. </p>
