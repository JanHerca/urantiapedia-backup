<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after that I saw thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, I saw a multitude beyond number and reckoning, who stood before the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits I saw four presences, different from those that sleep not, and I learnt their names: for the angel that went with me made known to me their names, and showed me all the hidden things. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I heard the voices of those four presences as they uttered praises before the Lord of glory. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The first voice blesses the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the second voice I heard blessing the Elect One and the elect ones who hang upon the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the third voice I heard pray and intercede for those who dwell on the earth and supplicate in the name of the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I heard the fourth voice fending off the Satans and forbidding them to come before the Lord of Spirits to accuse them who dwell on the earth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  After that I asked the angel of peace who went with me, who showed me everything that is hidden: “Who are these four presences which I have seen and whose words I have heard and written down.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he said to me: “This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days. </p>
