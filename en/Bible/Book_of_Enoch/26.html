<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a blessed place in which there were trees with branches abiding and blooming [of a dismembered tree]. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And there I saw a holy mountain, and underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream and it flowed towards the south. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I saw towards the east another mountain higher than this, and between them a deep and narrow ravine: in it also ran a stream underneath the mountain. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And to the west thereof there was another mountain, lower than the former and of small elevation, and a ravine deep and dry between them: and another deep and dry ravine was at the extremities of the three mountains. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And all the ravines were deep rand narrow, (being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted upon them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I marveled at the rocks, and I marveled at the ravine, yea, I marveled very much. </p>
