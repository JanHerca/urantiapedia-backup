<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And again I saw how they began to gore each other and to devour each other, and the earth began to cry aloud. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I raised mine eyes again to heaven, and I saw in the vision, and behold there came forth from heaven beings who were like white men: and four went forth from that place and three with them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And those three that had last come forth grasped me by my hand and took me up, away from the generations of the earth, and raised me up to a lofty place, and showed me a tower raised high above the earth, and all the hills were lower. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And one said unto me: “Remain here till thou seest everything that befalls those elephants, camels, and asses, and the stars and the oxen, and all of them.” </p>
