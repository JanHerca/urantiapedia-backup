<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a [Roman] colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there]. And she constrained us. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers, </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And the jailor reported the words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans; </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. </p>
