<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For [from] many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And there was much joy in that city. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship; </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth: <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other? </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  [And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.] <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
