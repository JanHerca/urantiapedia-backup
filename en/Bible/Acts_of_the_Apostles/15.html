<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, [saying], Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, [the brethren] appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and they wrote [thus] by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment; </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And after they had spent some time [there], they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  [But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.] </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus; </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. </p>
