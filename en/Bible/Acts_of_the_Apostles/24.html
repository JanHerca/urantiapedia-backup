<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and [with] an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: [and we would have judged him according to our law.] </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  [But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,] </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  [commanding his accusers to come before thee.] from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but [there were] certain Jews from Asia-- </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds. </p>
