<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  “And as for the angels you saw descending and ascending the ladder, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  in the last years there will be a man from the Most High, and he will desire to join the upper (things) with the lower. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And before his coming your sons and daughters will tell about him and your young men will have visions about him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Such will be the signs at the time of his coming: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A tree cut with an ax will bleed; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  three-month-old babes will speak understanding; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  a baby in the womb of his mother will speak of his way; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  a youth will be like an Old man. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And then the expected one will come, whose path will not be noticed by anyone. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “Then the earth will be glorified, receiving heavenly glory. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  What was above will be below also.c </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And from your seed will bloom a root of kings; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  it will emerged and overthrow the power of evil. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he himself will be the Savior for every land and rest for those who toil, and a Cloud shading the whole world from the buming heat. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For otherwise the uncontrollede will not be controlled. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  If he does not come,f the lower (things) cannot be joined with the upper. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  At his coming the idols of brass, stone, and any sort of carving will give voice for three days. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  They will give wise men news of him and let them know what will be on earth. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  By a star, those who wish to see on earth him whom the angels do not see above will find the way to him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Then the Almighty will be on earth in body, and, embraced by corporeal arms, he will restore human matter. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And he will revive Eve, who died by the fruit of the tree. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then the deceit of the impious will be exposed and all the idols will fall face down. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  For they will be put to shame by a dignitary. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For because (they were) lying by means of hallucinations, henceforth they will not be able to rule or to prophesy. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Honor will be tdcen from them and they will remain without glory. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  “For he who comes will take power and might and will give Abraham the truth which he previously told him. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Everything Sharp he will make dull, and the rough will be smooth. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he will cast all the iniquitous into the depths of the sea. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  He will work wonders in heaven and on earth. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And he will be wounded in the midst of his beloved house. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And when he is wounded, then salvation will be ready, and the end to all perdition. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For those who have wounded him will themselves receive a wound which will not be cured in them forever. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And all creation will bow to him who was wounded, and many will frust in him. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And he will become known everywhere in all lands, and those who acknowledge his name will not be ashamed. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  His own dominion and years will be unending forever.” </p>
