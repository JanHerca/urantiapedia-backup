<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And while I was still saying this prayer, behold, a voice came before my face saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Sariel, leader of the beguiled, you who are in charge of dreams, go and make Jacob understand the meaning of the dream he has had and explain to him everything he saw; but first bless him.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Sariel the archangel came to me and I saw (him), and his appearance was very beautiful and awesome. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But I was not astonished by his appearance, for the vision which I had seen in my dream was more terrible than he. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I did not fear the vision of the angel. </p>
