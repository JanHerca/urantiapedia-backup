<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Jacob then went to Laban his uncle. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He found a place and, laying his head on a stone, he slept there, for the sun had gone down. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He had a dream. And behold, a ladder was fixed on the earth, whose top reached to heaven. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the top of the ladder was the face as of a man, carved out of fire. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There were twelve steps leading to the top of the ladder, and on each step to the top there were two human faces, on the right and on the left, twenty-four faces (or busts) including their chests. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the face in the middle was higher than all that I saw, the one of fire, including the shoulders and arms, exceedingly temfying, more than those twenty-four faces. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And while I was still looking at it, behold, angels of God ascended and descended on it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And God was standing above its highest face, and he called to me from there, saying, “Jacob, Jacob!” And I said, “Here I am, LORD!” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he said to me, “The land on which you are sleeping, to you will I give it, and to your seed after you. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And through your seed all the earth and those living on it in the last times of the years of completion shall be blessed. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  My blessing with which I have blessed you shall flow from you unto the last </p>
<p> generation; the East and the West all shall be full of your tribe.” </p>
