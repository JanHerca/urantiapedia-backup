<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  “And when the king arises, judgment too will come upon that place. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then your seed, Israel, will go out of slaverya to the nations who hold them by force, and they will be free from any rebuke of your enemies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For this king is the head of all revenge and retaliationb against those who have done evil to you, Israel, and the end of the age. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For bitter ones will rise;c they will cry out, and the LORD will hear them and accept their plea. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the Mighty One will repent because of their sufferings. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the angels and archangels will hurl their bolts of lightning before them for the sake of the salvation of your tribe. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And you will gain the mercy of the Most High. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then their wives will bear many children. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And afterward the LORD will fight for your tribe through great and terrible signs against those who made them slaves. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He filled their storehouses, and they will be found empty. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Their land swarmed with reptiles and all sorts of deadly things. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  There will be earthquakes and much desüuction. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the LORD will pour out his wrath against Leviathan the sea-dragon; he will kill the lawless Falkon with the sword, because he will raise the wrath of the God of gods by his pride. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And then your justice will be revealed, Jacob, and that of your childrene who are to be after you (and) who will walk in your justice. •And then your seed will sound the hom and all the kingdom of Edom will perish together with all the peoples of Moab. </p>
