<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when I heard (this) from on high, awe and trembling fell upon me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I rose up from my dream and, the voice still being in my ears, I said, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “How fearful is this place! This is none Other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And I set up the stone which had been my pillow as a pillar, and I poured olive oil on the top of it, and I called the name of that place the House of God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And I stood and began to sing, and I said, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  "LORD God of Adam your creature and </p>
<p> LORD God of Abraham and Isaac my fathers </p>
<p> and of all who have walked before you in justice! </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  You who sit firmlyb on the cherubim and the fieryc throne of glory. . . and the many-eyed (ones) just as I saw in my dream, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  holding the four-faced cherubim, </p>
<p> bearing also the many-eyed seraphim, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  carrying the whole worldd under your arm, </p>
<p> yet not being borne by anyone; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  you who have made the skies firm for the glory of your name, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  stretching out on two heavenly clouds the heaven which gleams under you, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  that beneath it you may cause the sun to course and conceal it during the night so that it might not seem a god; </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  (you) who made on them a way for the moon and the stars; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and you make the moon wax and wane, and destine the stars to pass on </p>
<p> so that they too might not seem gods. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Before the face of your glory the six-winged seraphim are afraid, and they </p>
<p> cover their feet and faces with their wings, while flying with their </p>
<p> Other (wings), and they sing unceasingly a hymn: </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  ‘. . . whom I now in sanctifying a new (song) </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Twelve-topped, twelve-faced, many-named, fiery one! </p>
<p> Lightning-eyed holy one! </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Holy, Holy, Holy, Yao, Y aova, Yaoil, Yao, </p>
<p> Kados, Chavod, Savaoth, </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Omlemlech il avir amismi varich, </p>
<p> eternal king, mighty, powerful, most great, </p>
<p> patient, blessed one!’ </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  You who fill heaven and earth, the sea and abysses </p>
<p> and all the ages with your glory, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  hear my song with which I have sung you and grant me the request I ask of you, </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and tell me the interpretation of my dream, </p>
<p> for you are a god who is mighty, powerful and glorious, </p>
<p> a god who is holy; my LORD and LORD of my fathers.” </p>
