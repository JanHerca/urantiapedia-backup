<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body: </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened [them], and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel. </p>
