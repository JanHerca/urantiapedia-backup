<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the [other] day. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and [how] shall we do unto him? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. </p>
