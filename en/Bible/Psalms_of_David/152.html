<p> <i>Spoken by David when he was contending with the lion and the wolf which took a sheep from his flock.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O God, O God, come to my aid; help Thou me and save me; deliver Thou my soul from the slayer. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Shall I go down to Sheol by the mouth of the lion? or shall the wolf confound me? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Was it not enough for them that they lay in wait for my father's flock, and rent in pieces a sheep of my father's drove, but they were wishing also to destroy my soul? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Have pity, O Lord, and save Thy holy one from destruction; that he may rehearse Thy glories in all his times, and may praise Thy great name: </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  when Thou hast delivered him from the hands of the destroying lion and of the ravening wolf, and when Thou hast rescued my captivity from the hands of the wild beasts. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Quickly, O my Lord (Adonai), send from before Thee a deliverer, and draw me out of the gaping pit, which imprisons me in its depths. </p>
