<p> <i>Spoken by David when returning thanks to God, who had delivered him from the lion and the wolf and he had slain both of them.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Praise the Lord, all ye nations; glorify Him, and bless His name: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Who rescued the soul of His elect from the hands of death, and delivered His holy one from destruction: </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and saved me from the nets of Sheol, and my soul from the pit that cannot be fathomed. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because, ere my deliverance could go forth from before Him, I was well nigh rent in two pieces by two wild beasts. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But He sent His angel, and shut up from me the gaping mouths, and rescued my life from destruction. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  My soul shall glorify Him and exalt Him, because of all His kindnesses which He hath done and will do unto me. </p>
