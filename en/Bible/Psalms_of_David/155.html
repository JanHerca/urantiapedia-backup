<p> <i>When the People obtained permission from Cyrus to return home.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Lord, I have cried unto Thee; hearken Thou unto me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I have lifted up my hands to Thy holy dwelling-place; incline Thine ear unto me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And grant me my request; my prayer withhold not from me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Build up my soul, and destroy it not; and lay it not bare before the wicked. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Them that recompense evil things turn Thou away from me, O judge of truth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Lord, judge me not according to my sins, because no flesh is innocent before Thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Make plain to me, O Lord, Thy law, and teach me Thy judgments; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and many shall hear of Thy works, and the nations shall praise Thine honour. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Remember me and forget me not; and lead me not into things that be too hard for me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The sins of my youth make Thou to pass from me, and my chastisement let them not remember against me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Cleanse me, O  Lord, from the evil leprosy, and let it no more come unto me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Dry up its roots in (literally, from) me, and let not its leaves sprout within me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Great art Thou, O Lord; therefore my request shall be fulfilled from before Thee. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To whom shall I  complain that he may give unto me? and what can the strength of men add [unto me]? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  From before Thee, O Lord, is my confidence; I cried unto the Lord and He heard me, and healed the breaking of my heart. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I slumbered and slept; I dreamed and was helped, and the Lord sustained me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  They sorely pained my heart; I will return thanks because the Lord delivered me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Now will I rejoice in their shame; I have hoped in Thee, and I shall not be ashamed. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Give Thou honour for ever, even for ever and ever. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Deliver Israel Thine elect, and them of the house of Jacob Thy proved one. </p>
