<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given [to God]; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But in vain do they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding? </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them: </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude? </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan. </p>
