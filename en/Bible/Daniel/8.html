<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land]. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days [to come]. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it. </p>
