<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  KNOW ye therefore, my children, that in the last times your sons will forsake singleness, and will cleave unto insatiable desire. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And leaving guilelessness, will draw near to malice; and forsaking the commandments of the Lord, they will cleave unto Beliar. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And leaving husbandry, they will follow after their own wicked devices, and they shall be dispersed among the Gentiles, and shall serve their enemies. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And do you therefore give these commands to your children, that, if they sin, they may the more quickly return to the Lord; For He is merciful, and will deliver them, even to bring them back into their land. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, therefore, as ye see, I am a hundred and twenty-six years old and am not conscious of committing any sin. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Except my wife I have not known any woman. I never committed fornication by the uplifting of my eyes. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I drank not wine, to be led astray thereby; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I coveted not any desirable thing that was my neighbour's. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Guile arose not in my heart; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A lie passed not through my lips. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  If any man were in distress I joined my sighs with his, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I shared my bread with the poor. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I wrought godliness, all my days I kept truth. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I loved the Lord; likewise also every man with all my heart. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So do you also these things, my children, and every spirit of Beliar shall flee from you, and no deed of wicked men shall rule over you; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And every wild beast shall ye subdue, since you have with you the God of heaven and earth and walk with men in singleness of heart. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And having said these things, he commanded his sons that they should carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there in the cave with his fathers. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And he stretched out his feet and died, at a good old age; with every limb sound, and with strength unabated, he slept the eternal sleep. </p>
