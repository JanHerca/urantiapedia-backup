<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, [saying], Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses; </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me? </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations. </p>
