<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it. </p>
