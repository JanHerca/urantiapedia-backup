<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how [else] should I do, because of the daughter of my people? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is] he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come: </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, [and] the young men from the streets. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather [them]. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision: </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart. </p>
