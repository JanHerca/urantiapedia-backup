<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities thereof? </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come unto me? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy? </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side! </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them; </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah. </p>
