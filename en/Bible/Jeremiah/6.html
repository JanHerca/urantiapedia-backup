<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein]. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  I have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them. </p>
