<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh [her young], because there is no grass. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name's sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for [their] good. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay! </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Do not abhor [us], for thy name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things. </p>
