<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously? <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah. </p>
