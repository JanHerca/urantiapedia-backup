<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the One God. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We begin with the help of God and through his mediation to celebrate the death of the patriarch Isaac, son of the patriarch Abraham, and his ascension from his </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  body on this same day, which is the twenty-eighth of the month Misri. May the blessing of his intercession be with us and protect us from the temptations of the enemy! Amen! </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  [Now the patriarch Isaac wrote his testament and addressed his words of instruction to Jacob his son and all those who were gathered together with him. ] </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He said, “Hear, my brethren and my beloved ones, this speaker’s instruction and this curative medicine. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Because the way of God goes on forever, hear not only with chaste bodily ears, but also with the depth of the heart and with true faith without any doubt, as it is written, ‘Behold, you have heard a firm word as to what a man should become. If he has heard it with a pure heart, God will give him compassion when he asks for something from him.’” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “And it also is written, ‘There is no profit for someone to ask God for what  human beings solicit on earth.’ And if God has given us mastery on the earth, then how much the advantage of the one who has been firm in the faith in the word of God, and has held fast without doubt and with an upright heart to the knowledge of the commandments of God and the stories of his saints; for he will be the inheritor of the kingdom of God.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “For behold, God is compassionate and merciful, the one who has received unto himself thieves and tax collectors in past times because of the sincerity of their faith that comes from God. And God, moreover, is with the ages to come.” </p>
