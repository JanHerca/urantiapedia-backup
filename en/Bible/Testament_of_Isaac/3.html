<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When the angel had said this, he rose from the bed of our father Isaac and moved away from him. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Isaac kept looking at him and was amazed at what he had heard and seen. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So he undertook to say, “I shall not see the light until you send for me.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  While he was meditating on this, Jacob had come forward to the door of his father’s chamber. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The angel had already cast sleep upon him to prevent him from hearing them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So when he entered the resting place of his father, he said, “Father, with whom were you speaking?” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Isaac his father said to him, “Now you must hear me, my son. Word has been sent to your venerable father that he shall be taken from you, O my son Jacob.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Jacob embraced his father and wept, saying, “My strength has gone from me; will you make me an orphan, O my father, so that this day I shall become wretched?” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Again he embraced our father Isaac and kissed him; both of them wept until they were worn and weary. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Jacob said, “O father, I will go away with you and I will not give you up.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But Isaac said to him, “My boy, this is not for me to do, O my child and my beloved Jacob; but I thank God that you also have become a father and that you will remain until you are summoned. . .? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  As my father Abraham informed me, I am not able to set aside any part of the decree, which is valid for everyone; thus it will come to pass, for what is written will not be frustrated. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But God knows, my son, that my heart is weary on account of you. Yet I am happy in my going to the Lord. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So now that you have experienced growth in the Spirit, put away from you this weeping and lamenting. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Listen, my boy, that I may speak to you and give you understanding about the first man, I mean our father Adam, the created one, whom God formed with his own hand; likewise our mother Eve; also Abel and Seth and our father Enoch (Enosh?) and Mahalalel, the father of Methusaleh, and Lamech, the father of Jared, and Enosh (Enoch?), the father of our father Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and after them Phinehas and Kenan and Noah(?) and Eber and Reu and Terah and Nahor and my father Abraham and Lot the son of his brother. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  All of these death took away except our father Enoch, the perfect one who ascended to heaven. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  “And after this there shall come forth twelve giants. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then will come Jesus the Messiah from your descendants out of a virgin named Mary. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And God will become incarnate in him until the completion of a hundred years.” </p>
