<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  It came to pass, when the time drew near for our father Isaac, the father of fathers, to depart from this world and to go out from his body, that the Compassionate, the Merciful One sent to him the chief of the angels, Michael, the one whom he had sent to his father Abraham, on the morning of the twenty-eighth day of the month Misri. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The angel said to him, “Peace be upon you, O chosen son, our father Isaac!” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now it was customary every day for the holy angels to speak to him. So he prostrated himself and saw that the angel resembled his father Abraham. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then he opened his mouth, cried with a loud voice, and said with joy and exultation, “Behold, I have seen your face as if I had seen the face of the merciful Creator.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then the angel said to him, “O my beloved Isaac, I have been sent to you from the presence of the living God to take you up to heaven to be with your father Abraham and all the saints. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For your father Abraham is awaiting you; he himself is about to come for you, but now he is resting. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There has been prepared for you the throne beside your father Abraham; likewise for your beloved son Jacob. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And all of you shall be above every one else in the kingdom of heaven in the glory of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  You shall be entrusted with this name for all future generations: The Patriarchs. Thus you shall be fathers to all the world, O faithful elder, our father Isaac.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Isaac answered, saying to the angel, “I am truly amazed concerning you. Are you not my father Abraham?” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then said the angel to him, “I am not your Father Abraham, but I am the one who ministers to your father Abraham. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So now rejoice and be glad; for you will not be smitten (with disease)? and will not be taken (in death) with pain but with joy. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  You shall attain to blessings and repose forever and shall go forth from confinement into spaciousness. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Also you shall go away to rejoicing which has no end, and to light and bliss which have no limit, and to acclaim and delight without ceasing. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  “And now, make your will and set your house in order; for you are about to go away to (final) rest. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Nevertheless, blessedness shall be upon the father who begot you and upon your offspring which shall come after you!” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Now when our father Jacob heard them talking in this manner with one another, he began to listen to them, but he did not speak. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then our father Isaac said to the angel with patience and humility, “What shall I do now with regard to the light of my eye, my beloved Jacob? </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  I fear concerning him on account of Esau. You, of course, know the whole story.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Then the angel said to him, “My beloved Isaac, all the peoples which are in the world, if they were gathered together in one place, would not be able to undo your blessing upon Jacob; because, at that time when you blessed him, he was blessed by the supreme God, also by the Son and the Holy Spirit, and by your father Abraham; all of them responded, saying, ‘Amen.’ </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The iron (sword?) will not frighten him, but he will be exceedingly strong and will gain sovereignty. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then he will become the father of many nations, and twelve tribes will come forth from him.” </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Then Isaac said to the angel, “You have informed me and have brought me good news. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  But let Jacob not hear, for he will be sad and disturbed; for I have never pained his heart at all.” </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Then the angel of the Lord said, “O my beloved Isaac, all the righteous who go out from their bodies have blessedness, and they are blissful when they see God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But woe, woe three times, to the sinner when he has been born upon the earth, for he has many pains. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  You shall teach your sons your ways and the commandments of your father—all of them which he commanded you. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And do not hide these things from Jacob, that they may be a reminder to the generations of his offspring after him, so that the faithful may observe them and by them attain to the life eternal, which is forever. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  But I shall take account of your concern. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Behold, I came to you with joy, speedily. The peace which the Lord gave, I give to you. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And now I go quickly to the one who sent me.” </p>
