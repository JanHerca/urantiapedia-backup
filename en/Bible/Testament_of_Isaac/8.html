<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Such was the decease of our father Abraham and our father Isaac, son of Abraham, on the twenty-eighth day of the month of Misri, on this very day. This day we have consecrated and designated. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And on the day when our father Abraham offered the sacrifice to God, on the twenty-eighth day of the month of Amshir, the heavens and the earth were filled with the sweet fragrance of his way of life before the Lord. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And our father Isaac was like the silver which is burned, smelted, purified, and refined in the fire; likewise everyone who shall come forth from our father Isaac, the father of fathers. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  On the day when Abraham, the father of fathers, offered him as a sacrifice to God, the perfume of his sacrifice ascended to the veil of the curtain of the one who controls everything. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Blessed is everyone who manifests mercy on the memorial day of the father of fathers, our father Abraham and our father Isaac, for each of them shall have a dwelling in the kingdom of heaven, because our Lord has made with them his true covenant forever. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he will keep it for them and for those who come after them, saying to them, “Whatever person has manifested mercy in the name of my beloved Isaac, behold I will give him to you in the kingdom of heaven and he shall be present with them at the first moment of the millennial banquet to celebrate with them in the everlasting light in the kingdom of our Master and our God and our King and our Savior, Jesus the Messiah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He is the one to whom are due the glory, the dignity, the majesty, the dominion, the reverence, the honor, the praise, and the adoration, along with the merciful Father and the Holy Spirit now and for all time, and to all eternity and forever and ever, amen!”’ </p>
