<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After this the angel took me to heaven and I saw Abraham. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So I prostrated myself before him and he received me graciously, he and all the godly ones. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then they all came together and did me honor because of my father. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then they took me by the hand and led me to the curtain before the throne of the Father. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So I prostrated myself before him and worshiped him with my father and all the saints, while we uttered praises and cried aloud, saying, “Most holy, most holy, most holy is the Lord Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are filled with your sanctified glory.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then the Lord said to me from his holy height, “As to everyone who shall name his son after my beloved Isaac, my blessing shall rest upon him and be in his house forever. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Excellent is your coming, O Abraham, faithful one; excellent is your lineage, and excellent is the presence here of this blessed lineage. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So now, everything which you ask in the name of your beloved son Isaac you shall have today as a covenant forever.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then my father Abraham answered and said, “Yours is the sovereignty, O Lord, ruler of the universe.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The Lord from his holy height said to my father Abraham, “Every man who shall call his son by the name of my beloved Isaac, or shall write his own testament, shall have a blessing which shall not come to an end, and my blessing upon his house shall not cease. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Or if anyone will give a poor man something to eat on the day of the festival of my beloved Isaac then I will give him to you in my kingdom.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then my father Abraham said, “O Father, God, ruler of the universe, even if he is not able to write his testament or his covenant, let your blessing and your mercy enfold him, for you are the merciful one.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Lord said to Abraham, Let him feed the hungry one with bread and I will give him a place in my kingdom and he shall be present with you from the first moment of the millennial banquet.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The saving God also said to my father Abraham, “And if he is so poor that he does not find bread in his house, then let him spend a whole night commemorating my beloved Isaac without sleeping and I will bestow upon him a heritage in my kingdom.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  My father Abraham said, “And if he is weak and cannot endure the vigil, then may your mercy and compassion still enfold him.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  So the Lord said to him, “Then let him offer a little incense in my name on the memorial day of my beloved Isaac, your son. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And if it should be that he does not know how to read, then let him go to hear the reading from one who can read it. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If he cannot do any of these things, then let him enter his house, lock the door behind him, and pray a hundred prayers of repentance; then I will give him to you as a son in my kingdom. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But above and beyond all this, let him bring an offering on the memorial day of my beloved Isaac. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And all those who shall do all that I have said shall be granted the inheritance of the kingdom in my heaven. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And all who took pains to write their testaments and covenants and life stories, and showed mercy if only (by giving) a cup of cold water, and believed with all their hearts—with them shall be my strength and my Holy Spirit for the prosperity of their affairs in the world. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  There shall not be any trouble in their departure (from this world), I will grant them a lifetime in my kingdom, and they shall be present from the first moment of the millennial banquet. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Peace be upon you, O my beloved ones, the saints!’ </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  When he had concluded all this discourse, the heavenly beings began to cry out, saying, “Most holy, most holy, most holy is the Lord, Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are filled with your sanctified glory.” </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  The Father who controls everything answered from this holy place and said, “O Michael, my faithful servant, call in all the angels and all the saints.” </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Then he mounted the chariot of the seraphim, while the cherubim went before [with the angels. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And when they had come to the couch of our father Isaac, our father Isaac immediately beheld the face of our Lord, full of joy toward him. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  He cried out, “It is well that you have come, my Lord, with your great archangel, Michael. It is well that you have come, my Father, with all the saints.”].? </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  When he has said this, Jacob was greatly disturbed and he clung to his father and kissed him, weeping. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Then our father Isaac raised him up and made a sign to him, giving a hint with his eyes, meaning, “Be silent, my boy.” </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  So Abraham said to the Lord, “O Lord, remember also my (grand)son Jacob.”’ </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Then the Lord said to him, “‘My power shall be with him, he shall glorify my name, he shall become master of the land of promise, and the enemy shall not hold Sway over him.” </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And our father Isaac said, “Jacob, my beloved son, keep my injunction which I lay down today that you preserve my body. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Do not profane the image of God by how you treat it; for the image of man was made like the image of God; and God will treat you accordingly at the time when you meet him and see him face to face. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  He is the first and the last, as the prophets have said.” </p>
