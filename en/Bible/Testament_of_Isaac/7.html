<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Isaac had said this, the Lord took his soul from his body and it was white as snow; he took possession of it and carried it with him upon his holy chariot and ascended with it to the heavens, while the cherubim were singing praises before it, likewise his holy angels. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Lord bestowed upon him the kingdom of heaven; and everything which our father desired out of the abundance of blessings from God he had, including the fulfillment of his covenant forever. </p>
