<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Isaac used to fast every day, not breaking his fast until evening. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He would offer up sacrifices for himself and for all people of his household, for the salvation of their souls. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He would rise up for prayer in the middle of the night, and in the daytime he would pray to God. He kept on doing this for many years. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He would also fast the three forty-day periods, every time the forty-day period came around.’ </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he would not eat meat or drink wine all his life long. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He also would not enjoy the taste of fruit, nor would he sleep upon a bed, because he was devoted to prayer every day and to supplication to God all his life. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So when the crowds heard that a man of God had appeared, they flocked to him from all the districts and places to hear his instructions and life-giving recommendations and to be assured that the spirit of God was speaking in him. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then the great ones who had flocked to him said, “What is this power which descended upon you after the time when the brightness of your eyesight went from you, and how have you had a reprieve to see now?” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then the faithful old man smiled and said to them, “As to those who have presented themselves, I will inform them that God healed me when he saw that I had drawn near to the gate of death. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He awarded me this honor in my old age that I might be a priest of the Lord.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then someone (Jacob?) said to him, “Begin for me a discourse that I may be consoled by it and hold fast to it.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So our father Isaac said to him, “If you speak in anger, guard yourself from slander and beware of empty boasting. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  See that you do not converse alone (with a woman). </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Be careful that an evil word does not is come forth from your mouth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Guard your body, that it may be pure, for it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, which dwells within it. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Take care of the lesser functions of your body, that it may be pure and sanctified. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  See that you do not make sport with your tongue lest an evil word go forth from your mouth. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  “Beware of stretching out your hand to what you do not own. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Do not present an offering when you are not ritually clean; bathe yourself in water when you intend to approach the altar. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Do not mingle your thoughts with the thoughts of the world, as you stand at the altar in the presence of God. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Make your offering so that you may be a peacemaker between men. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  As you are about to present your offering to God, when you have moved forward to approach the altar, you shall pray to God a hundred times without ceasing. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  “At the beginning you shall voice this thanksgiving, as follows, ‘O God, the incomprehensible, who cannot be searched out, the possessor of power, the source of purity, cleanse me by your mercy, a free gift from you to me. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For I am a creature of flesh and blood, fleeing to you. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I know of my uncleanness, and surely you will cleanse me, O Lord. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  “For behold, my cause is in your hands and my recourse is to you. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  I know my sin, so cleanse me, O Lord, that I may enter into your presence with self-respect. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Now my offenses are weighty; I have drawn near to the fire which burns. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Your mercy is upon all things, so that you can take away all my transgressions. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Pardon me, even me, the sinner. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And pardon all your creatures whom you have fashioned, but who have not heard and learned of you. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  “‘I am like all who are in your image. I have turned to the doing of what is forbidden to me. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  I have come to you and I am your servant and the sinful son of your nation, but you are the very forgiving one. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Forgive me by the graciousness that comes from you, and hear my entreaty that I may be worthy of standing at your holy altar. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  May this burnt offering be acceptable to you. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Do not turn me back to my ignorance because of my sins. Receive me like the lost sheep. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  May the God who provided for our father Adam, and Abel and Noah, and our father Abraham, be with you, O Jacob, and with me also. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Receive my offering from me.’ </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  “So if you have approached and have done this before your ascent to the altar, then offer your sacrifice. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  But you shall take care and be alert that you do not grieve the spirit of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  For the work of the priesthood is not easy, since it is incumbent upon every priest, from today until the completion of the last of the generations and the end of the world, that he should not be filled by the drinking of wine nor be satisfied by the eating of bread; and that he should not talk about </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  the concerns of the world nor listen to one who does talk about them. But priests must expend all of their efforts and their lives in prayer and watchfulness and perseverance in piety, in order that each one may petition the Lord successfully. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  “Moreover, every man on earth, whether wretched or fortunate, has incumbent upon him the keeping of the proper commandments. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  For men, after a short time, will be removed from this world and its intense anxiety. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  Then they will be engaged in holy, angelic service by reason of purity. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  They will be presented before the Lord and his angels because of their pure offerings and their angelic service. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  For their earthly conduct will be reflected in heaven, and the angels will be their friends because of their perfect faith and purity. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  Great is their esteem before the Lord, and there is no one either small or great in whom the Lord will not make improvement; for the Lord wishes that each be without fault or offense. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  “And now, continue to supplicate God with repentance for your past sins, and do not commit more sin. </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  Accordingly, do not kill with the sword, do not kill with the tongue, do not fornicate with your body, and do not remain angry until sunset. </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  Do not let yourself receive unjustified praise, and do not rejoice at the fall of your enemies or of your brothers. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  Do not blaspheme; beware of slander. </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  Do not look at a woman with a lustful eye. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  These things and what is like them you shall guard against, in order that each one of you may be saved from the wrath which will be manifested from heaven. ” </p>
