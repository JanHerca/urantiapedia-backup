The First Epistle of Peter is a book of the New Testament. The author presents himself as Peter the Apostle. The ending of the letter includes a statement that implies that it was written from “Babylon”, which is possibly a reference to Rome. The letter is addressed to the “chosen pilgrims of the diaspora” in Asia Minor suffering religious persecution.
