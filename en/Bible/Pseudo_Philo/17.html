<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then was the lineage of the priests of God declared by the choosing of a tribe, and it was said unto Moses: Take throughout every tribe one rod and put them in the tabernacle, and then shall the rod of him to whomsoever my glory shall speak, flourish, and I will take away the murmuring from my people. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Moses did so and set 12 rods, and the rod of Aaron came out, and put forth blossom and yielded seed of almonds. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And this likeness which was born there was like unto the work which Israel wrought while he was in Mesopotamia with Laban the Syrian, when he took rods of almond, and put them at the gathering of waters, and the cattle came to drink and were divided among the peeled rods, and brought forth [kids] white and speckled and parti-coloured. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore was the synagogue of the people made like unto a flock of sheep, and as the cattle brought forth according to the almond rods, so was the priesthood established by means of the almond rods. </p>
