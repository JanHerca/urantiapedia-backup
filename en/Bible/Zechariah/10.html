<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, [even of] Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they shall be as mighty men, treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah. </p>
