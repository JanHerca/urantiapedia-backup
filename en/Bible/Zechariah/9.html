<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [shall be] its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah); </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for [they shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
