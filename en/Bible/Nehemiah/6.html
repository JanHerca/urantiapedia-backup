<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;) </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. </p>
