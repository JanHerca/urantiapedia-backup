<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, [to wit], Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants. </p>

<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city. </p>
