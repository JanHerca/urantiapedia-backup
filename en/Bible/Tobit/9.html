<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife. </p>
