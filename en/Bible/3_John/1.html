<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth [them] out of the church. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Demetrius hath the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write [them] to thee with ink and pen: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. </p>
