## 16. Funeral Prayer for the Dead (_AposCon_ 8.41.2—5)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (2)</small></sup></span> And on behalf of those our brothers who are at rest in Christ a
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> let us beg;
on behalf of the repose of this brother or that sister,
let us beg;
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> that God, the lover of man, having received his soul,
may forgive him every sin—voluntary and involuntary;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> and being gracious and favorable,
may appoint him to a position among the godly ones,
sent into the embrace of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
with all those from of old who were well pleasing, and who did his will;
where pain and grief and moaning have fled away.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> Let us arise! Let us commit ourselves, and one another, to the eternal God,
through the Word (which was) in the beginning!
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> And let the bishop say,
(4) “O you who are by nature immortal and unending,
through whom everything immortal and mortal has come into being;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span> who with artistic skill made this rational living being, man, the mortal world citizen,
and who promised resurrection;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span> who did not permit Enoch and Elijah to experience death,
the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
not as of the dead, but as God of the living, are you.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span> Because, with you, all souls are alive,
and the spirits of the righteous are in your hand, whom anguish will not touch.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span> For all those who are set apart are under your hand.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11 (5)</small></sup></span> Also now yourself, look upon this your servant,
whom you have chosen, and received into another sphere;
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span> and forgive him, if he has committed any great sin, voluntarily or involuntarily;
and place beside him favorable angels;
and appoint him (a place) in the embrace of the patriarchs, and the prophets, and
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span> the apostles,
and of all those who from of old were pleasing to you;
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span> where there cannot be grief, and pain, and moaning,
but a free place of godly ones,
and a land of upright ones, set up for you,
and for those in it who see the glory of your Christ;
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span> With whom to you be glory, honor, and awe, thanksgiving and worshipt
and to the Holy Spirit. forever. Amen.”
