## 14. A Portion of a Prayer Prayed at the Ordination of Presbyters (_AposCon_ 8.16.3)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span> O Lord, Almighty, our God,
who through Christa made ev (3)erything,
and through him provide for everything appropriately;
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> for to the One having power to make differing things,
to this One belongs power also to provide in differing ways;
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> for through him, O God, you indeed provide for those who are immortal in a
place of security, in a mansion;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> while for those who are mortal, (you provide) in successive ways,
for the soul by meditation upon laws,
for the body by the satisfaction of wants.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> Now also yourself, look upon your holy Church and increase it;
and multiply those leading it;
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> and give power so that they may work hard in word and in deed,
for the building up of your people!
