<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (l)</small></sup></span> (Then after the communion, you Shall give thanks in this way:)
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2 (2)</small></sup></span> We give thanks to you, O God and Father of Jesus our Savior a
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>
on behalf of your holy name which you caused to encamp among us.
and on behalf of the knowledge and faith and love and immortality which
you gave to us through Jesusb your Son.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4 (3)</small></sup></span> O Master Almighty, the God of the universe.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>
you created the world and what is in it through him;c
and you planted deeply in our souls a law;
and you prepared for men the things (necessary) for communion;
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> (you are) the God of the holy and blameless ones, our fathers Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob, your faithful servants;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span> the powerful God, the faithful and true One, without falsehood in your promises;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span> the One who sent forth upon earth Jesus your Christ, to live together with men
as a man, being divine Word and Man, and radically to destroy error.d
