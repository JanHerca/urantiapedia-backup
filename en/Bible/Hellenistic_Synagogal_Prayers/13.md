## 13. A Prayer of Praise and Benediction, Spoken by a Bishop at the Close of the Eucharistic Service (_AposCon_ 8.15.7—9)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (7)</small></sup></span> O God, the Almighty, the True one and Incomparable one,
who is everywhere, and is present in all things;
and who is in nothing as though being one certain thing;
the one who is not circumscribed in places;
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> the one who is not growing old in time;
the one who does not come to an end in the ages;
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> the one who is not deceived by words;
the one who is not subject to origin;
the one who does not need a guardian;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> the one who is above corruption;
the one who does not admit change;
the one who by nature is unchangeable;
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> the one who dwells in unapproachable light;
the one who is by nature invisible;
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> the one who is known by all those who with good will seek you with rational natures;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span> the one who is understood by those who with good will seek after you;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span> the God of Israel, the one truly seeing,
Your people who have believed in Christ:
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9 (8)</small></sup></span> being gracious, attend to me on account of your name,
and bless those who have bended low their necks before you,
and give to them the requests of their hearts—the things that are profitable—
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span> and do not make one of them a castaway from your Kingdom,
but consecrate them, guard, shelter, assist, deliver them from the stranger, from every' enemy;
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span> preserve their homes,
guard their goings in and goings out!
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12 (9)</small></sup></span> Because to you (belong) glory, praise, splendor, reverence, (and) worship;
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span> and to your Servant Jesus, to your Christ, to our Lord, both God and King:
and to the Holy Spirit;
now, and always, and into the ages of the ages. Amen.
