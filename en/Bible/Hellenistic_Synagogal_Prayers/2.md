## 2. A Prayer of Praise to God, the Universal Savior and Fighter on Behalf of Abraham's Race (_AposCon_ 7.33.2—7)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (2)</small></sup></span> Our eternal Savior:
the King of the gods,
who alone is Almighty and Lord,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> the God of all beings,
and God of our holy and blameless fathers before us,
the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> the merciful and compassionate,
the patient and very merciful,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> to whom every heart is seen, appearing naked,
and every hidden thought is uncovered;
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> to you the souls of righteous people cry out!
Upon you the hopes of devout people have relied:
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> the Father of the blameless,
the Hearer of those who call upon you with honesty,
the one who knows the petitions unspoken.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span> For your forethought reaches as far as human (inner) feelings,
and through (the) conscience you search each person's judgment,
and in every region of the inhabited earth,
the incense that comes through prayer and words is sent up to you.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8 (3)</small></sup></span> You are the one who appointed the present world as a racecourse for righteousness,
and opened to everyone a gate of mercy,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span> and showed to every person, through implanted knowledge, and inborn judgment,
and by their response to the law,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span> how the possession of wealth is surely not everlasting,
the beauty of appearance is not ever-flowing,
the strength of power is easily dissolved,
and surely everything is a vapor, and vanity.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span> But a conscience with undisguised faith endures,
a dwelling-place through the midst of the heavens.
rising up with truth,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span> it takes hold by the right hand of the coming nourishment.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span> At the same time, and before the promise of the regeneration is present,
the soul itself, exulting, is rejoiced.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14 (4)</small></sup></span> For from the beginning of our forefather Abraham's laying claim to the way of truth.
You led (him) by a vision,
having taught (him) what at any time this world is.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span> And his faith traveled ahead of his knowledge,
but the covenant was the follower of his faith.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span> For you said,
_I will make your seed like the stars of the heaven,_
_and like the sand that is beside the edge of the sea._
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17 (5)</small></sup></span> But truly, having also given Isaac to him,
and having known him to be like that one in character,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span> you were also called his God, having said,
_I will be your God, and of your seed after you._
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span> And having placed our father Jacob in Mesopotamia, having shown (him) the Christ,
through him you spoke, saying,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span> _Look! I am with you,_
_and I will increase you,_
_and multiply you exceedingly._
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21 (6)</small></sup></span> And in this way you spoke to Moses.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span> your faithful and holy servant,
in the vision at the bush:
_I am the Being;_
_this is for me an eternal name,_
_and a remembrance to generations of generations._
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23 (7)</small></sup></span> O Fighter on behalf of Abraham's race,
blessed are you forever!
