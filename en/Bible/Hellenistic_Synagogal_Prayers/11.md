## 11. A Prayer of Entreaty for God's Mercy upon the Penitent (_AposCon_ 8.9.8f.)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (8)</small></sup></span> O Almighty God, eternal one,
Master of the whole universe,
Creator and President of everything,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> the one who showed forth man as a (micro-)cosm of the cosmos through Christ
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> and who gave an implanted and written law to him,
so that he might live lawfully as a rational being,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> and when he had sinned, gave him your goodness, as a pledge to lead him to repentance;
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> look upon those who have bent the neck of their soul and body to you, because
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> _He does not desire the death of the sinner, but his repentance,_
_so that he might turn back from his way of evil, and live!_
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7 (9)</small></sup></span> (You are) the one who accepted the repentance of the Ninevites;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span> the one desiring all men to be saved, and to come to a knowledge of truth;
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span> the one who accepted the son who had consumed his life's savings with loose
with fatherly feelings because of his repentance.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span> Also now yourself receive from your supplicants their Change of mind;
for there is no one who Will not sin against you.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span> For, if you, Lord. should watch lawlessness closely, Lord, who could stand his ground?
Because with you there is the means for taking away sin!
