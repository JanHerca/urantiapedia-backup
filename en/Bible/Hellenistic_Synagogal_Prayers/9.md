## 9. A Prayer of Praise to God for His Greatness, and for His Appointment of Leaders for His People (_AposCon_ 8.5.1—4)

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (l)</small></sup></span> The one who is, Master, Lord, God the Almighty;
the only one without origin and without a king;
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> the one who is forever, and who exists before the ages;
the one needing nothing in any way, and greater than every cause and origin;
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span> the only true one, the only wise one;
the one who is alone Most High;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> the one who is by nature invisible;
whose knowledge is without beginning;
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> the only good one, and incomparable one;
the one who knows all things before their origin;
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span> the knower of the hidden things,
the unapproachable one,
the one without a master;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7 (2)</small></sup></span> the God and Father of your only Son, our God and Savior,
the maker of the whole universe through him;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span> the Administrator, the Guardian,
the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation,
the one who dwells in (the) heights, and who observes humble things;
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9 (3)</small></sup></span> you are the one who gave standards for the Church,
through the appearance in flesh of your Christ,
subiect to the witness by the Paraclete,
through your apostles and through us bishops who by your grace are present.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span> (You are) the one who marked out beforehand, from the beginning,
priests for dominion over your people:
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span> Abel at first,
Seth and Enos and Enoch and Noah, and Melchizedek and Job;
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12 (4)</small></sup></span> the one who showed forth Abraham, and the other patriarchs,
together with your faithful servants Moses and Aaron, and Eleazar and Phinehas;
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span> the one who prepared beforehand from among them rulers and priests in the tent of the testimony;
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span> the one choosing for yourself Samuel, to be a priest and a prophet;
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span> the one who did not forsake your sanctuary without public services;
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span> the one who was pleased to be glorified by those you have chosen.
