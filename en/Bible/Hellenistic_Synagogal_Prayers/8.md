## 8. Instruction for Catechumens (AposCon 7.39.2—4)

Translated by D. A. Fiensy.

<span id="v1"><sup><small>1 (2)</small></sup></span> Let the one who is to be insüucted in pietyb be taught before baptism: knowledge concerning the unbegotten God, understanding concerning the only begotten son,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span> and full assurance concerning the Holy Spirit. Let him leam the order of a distinguished creation, the sequence of providence, the judgment seats of different legislation, why the world came to be and why man was appointed a world
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3 (3)</small></sup></span> citizen. Let him understand his own nature, of what sort it is. Let him be educated in how God punished the wicked by water and fire, and glorified the saints in
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span> each generation: I mean Seth, Enos, Enoch, Noah, Abraham and his descendants, Melchisedek, Job, Moses, both Joshua and Caleb, Phinehas the priest, and the
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span> holy ones in each generation. And how God, though he foresaw, did not abandon the race of men, but summoned them at various times from error and folly _into the understanding of truth_, leading them from servitude and impiety into freedom and piety, from iniquity into righteousness, from eternal death into everlasting
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6 (4)</small></sup></span> life. Let the one who offers himself learn during his instruction these things and those that are related to them.
