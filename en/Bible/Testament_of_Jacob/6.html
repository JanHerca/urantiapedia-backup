<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And when the days of their mourning were finished, Pharaoh was still weeping over Jacob because of his regard for Joseph. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Joseph addressed the nobles of Pharaoh and said to them, “Since I have found favor with you, will you speak on my behalf to Pharaoh the king, and say to him that Jacob made me take an oath that when he went out from his body I would bury his body in the tomb of my fathers in the land of Canaan, in that very place?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Go in peace and bury your father in accordance with the oath which he required of you. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And take with you chariots and horses, the best of my kingdom and from my own household as you desire.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So Joseph worshiped God in the presence of Pharaoh, went forth from him, and set out to bury his father. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And there set out with him the slaves of Pharaoh, the elders of Egypt, all the household of Joseph, and his brothers and all Israel. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They all went up with him into the chariots, and the entourage moved along like a great army. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They descended into the land of Canaan to the riverbank across the Jordan and they mourned for him in that place with very great grief indeed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They maintained that great grief for him for seven days. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So when the inhabitants of Dan heard about the mourning in their land, they said, “This great mourning is that of the Egyptians.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  To this day [they call that place “the Mourning of the Egyptians” ]. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then Israel was carried forward and was buried in the land of Canaan in the second tomb. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This is the one which Abraham had bought with authorization for burials from Ephron opposite Mamre. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  After that Joseph returned to the land of Egypt with his brothers and all the retinue of Pharaoh. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Joseph lived after the death of his father many years. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He continued to rule over Egypt, though Jacob had died and was left behind with his own people. </p>
