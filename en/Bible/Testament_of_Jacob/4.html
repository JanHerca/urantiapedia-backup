<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  After this, the time for Jacob-Israel to leave his body had arrived. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So he summoned Joseph and said to him, “If indeed you have found grace, place your blessed hand under my side and swear an oath before the Lord that you will place my body in the tomb of my fathers.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Joseph said to him, “I will do exactly what you command me, O beloved of God.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But he said to Joseph, “I want you to swear to me.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So Joseph swore to Jacob, his father, to the effect that he would carry his body to the tomb of his fathers, and Jacob accepted the oath of his son. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Afterward, this report reached Joseph: “Your father has become uneasy.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So he took his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and went before his father Jacob. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Joseph said to him, “These are my sons whom God has given me in the land of Egypt to come after me.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Israel said, “Bring them closer to me here.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For the eyes of Israel had become dim from his advanced age so that he could not see. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So Joseph brought his sons closer and Jacob kissed them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then Joseph commanded them, namely Ephraim and Manasseh, to bow down before Jacob to the ground. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Joseph took Manasseh and put him at Israel’s right hand and Ephraim at his left hand. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But Israel reversed his hands and let his right hand rest upon the head of Ephraim and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He blessed them and gave them back to their father and said, “May the God under whose authority my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, served in reverence, the God who has strengthened me from my youth up to the present time when the angel has saved me from all my afflictions, may he bless these lads, Manasseh and Ephraim. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  May my name be upon them, also the names of my holy fathers, Abraham and Isaac.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  After this, Israel said to Joseph, “I shall die, and all of you will return to the land of your fathers and God will be with you. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And you personally have received a mighty favor, greater than that of your brothers, for I have taken this arrow with my bow and my sword from the Amorites(?).” </p>
