<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  You shall honor the memory of our fathers, the patriarchs, at this time each year and on this same day, which is the twenty-eighth of the month of Misri. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  This is what we have found written in the ancient documents of our fathers, the saints who were pleasing to God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Because of their intercession and their prayer, we shall have all things, namely a share and a place in the kingdom of heaven which belongs to our Lord and our God and our Master and our Savior, Jesus the Messiah. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He is the one whom we ask to forgive us for our mistakes and our errors and to overlook our misdeeds. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May he be kind to us on the day of his judgment and let us hear the voice filled with joy, kindness, and gladness, saying, “Come to me, O blessed ones of my Father, inherit the kingdom which was yours from before the creation of the world.”’ </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And may we be worthy to receive his divine secrets, which are the means to the pardon of our sins. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May he help us toward the salvation of our souls, and may he ward off from us the blows of the wicked enemy. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May he let us stand at his right hand on the great and terrible day for the intercession of the mistress of intercessions, the source of purity, generosity, and blessings, the mother of salvation;* and for the intercession of all the martyrs, saints, doers of pleasing deeds, and everyone who has pleased the Lord with his pious deeds and his good will. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Amen, amen, amen. And praise to God always, forever, eternally. </p>
