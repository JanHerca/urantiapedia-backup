<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Jacob sent for all his children and said to them, “Gather around me that I may inform you of everything which will come upon you and what will overtake each one of you in the last days.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So they gathered around Israel from the eldest to the youngest of them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Jacob-Israel spoke up and said to his sons, “Listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to your father Israel, from Reuben my firstborn to Benjamin.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then he told them what would come upon the twelve children, calling each one of them and his tribe by name; and he blessed them with the celestial blessing. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  After this they were silent for a short time in order that he might rest. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So the heavens rejoiced that he could observe the places of repose.* </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And behold, there approached numerous tormentors differing in their aspects. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They were prepared to torment the sinners, who are these: adulterers, male and female; those lusting after males; the vicious who degrade the semen given by God; the astrologers and the sorcerers; the evildoers and the worshipers of idols who hold onto abominations; and the slanderers who pass judgment(?) with two tongues (deceitfully). </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And as to all these sinners, their punishment is the fire which will not be extinguished and the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  [Here there is a lacuna in the Arabic text. In the Bohairic, Jacob is again taken up, this time to heaven, where all is light and joy. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He sees Abraham and Isaac and is shown all the joys of the redeemed. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Jacob returns to earth, gives instructions for his burial in the land of his fathers, and passes away at the age of 147 years. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Lord comes down with the angels Michael and Gabriel to bear Jacob’s soul to heaven. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Joseph orders his father’s body to be embalmed in the Egyptian manner. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Forty days are spent in the embalming process, and eighty more days are spent in mourning for the patriarch. ] </p>
