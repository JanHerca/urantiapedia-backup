<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  So when the angel had made this statement to our father Jacob, he ascended from him into heaven, as Jacob bade him farewell. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Those who were around Jacob heard him as he thanked God and glorified him with praise. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And all the members of his household, great and small, gathered around him, weeping over him, deeply grieving and saying, “You are going away and leaving us as orphans.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they kept on saying to him, “O our beloved father, what shall we do, for we are in a strange land?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So Jacob said to them, “Do not fear; God himself appeared to me in Upper Mesopotamia and said to me, ‘I am the God of your fathers; do not fear, for I am with you forever and with your descendants who will come after you. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  This land in which you are I am about to give to you and to your descendants after you forever. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And do not be afraid to go down to Egypt. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I will make for you a great people and your descendants will increase and multiply forever. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Joseph will put his hand on your eyes and your people will multiply in the land of Egypt. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Afterward they will come to this place and will be without care. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I will do good to them for your sake, though for the time being they will be displaced from here.’” </p>
