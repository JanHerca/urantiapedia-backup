<p> <i>Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob and Rachel, the beautiful and beloved. His struggle against the Egyptian temptress.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE copy of the Testament of Joseph. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When he was about to die he called his sons and his brethren together, and said to them:— </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My brethren and my children, hearken to Joseph the beloved of Israel; give ear, my sons, unto your father. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I have seen in my life envy and death, yet I went not astray, but persevered in the truth—of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  These my brethren hated me, but the Lord loved me: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They wished to slay me, but the God of my fathers guarded me: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They let me down into a pit, and the Most High brought me up again. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I was sold into slavery, and the Lord of all made me free: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I was taken into captivity, and His strong hand succoured me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I was beset with hunger, and the Lord Himself nourished me. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I was alone, and God comforted me: </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  I was sick, and the Lord visited me. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I was in prison, and my God showed favour unto me; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In bonds, and He released me; </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Slandered, and He pleaded my cause; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Bitterly spoken against by the Egyptians, and He delivered me; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Envied by my fellow-slaves, and He exalted me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And this chief captain of Pharaoh entrusted to me his house. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And I struggled against a shameless woman, urging me to transgress with her; but the God of Israel my father delivered me from the burning flame. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  I was cast into prison, I was beaten, I was mocked; but the Lord granted me to find mercy, in the sight of the keeper of the prison. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  For the Lord doth not forsake them that fear Him, neither in darkness, nor in bonds, nor in tribulations, nor in necessities. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For God is not put to shame as a man, nor as the son of man is he afraid, nor as one that is earth-born is He weak or affrighted. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  But in all those things doth He give protection, and in divers ways doth He comfort, though for a little space He departeth to try the inclination of the soul. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  In ten temptations He showed me approved, and in all of them I endured; for endurance is a mighty charm, and patience giveth many good things. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  How often did the Egyptian woman threaten me with death! </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  How often did she give me over to punishment, and then call me back and threaten me, and when I was unwilling to company with her, she said to me: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Thou shalt be lord of me, and all that is in my house, if thou wilt give thyself unto me, and thou shalt be as our master. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  But I remembered the words of my father, and going into my chamber, I wept and prayed unto the Lord. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And I fasted in those seven years, and I appeared to the Egyptians as one living delicately, for they that fast for God's sake receive beauty of face. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And if my lord were away from home, I drank no wine; nor for three days did I take my food, but I gave it to the poor and sick. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And I sought the Lord early, and I wept for the Egyptian woman of Memphis, for very unceasingly did she trouble me, for also at night she came to me under pretence of visiting me. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And because she had no male child she pretended to regard me as a son. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And for a time she embraced me as a son, and I knew it not; but later, she sought to draw me into fornication. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And when I perceived it I sorrowed unto death; and when she had gone out, I came to myself, and lamented for her many days, because I recognized her guile and her deceit. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And I declared unto her the words of the Most High, if haply she would turn from her evil lust. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  Often, therefore, did she flatter me with words as a holy man, and guilefully in her talk praise my chastity before her husband, while desiring to ensnare me when we were alone. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  For she lauded me openly as chaste, and in secret she said unto me: Fear not my husband; for he is persuaded concerning thy chastity: for even should one tell him concerning us, he would not believe. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Owing to all these things I lay upon the ground, and besought God that the Lord would deliver me from her deceit. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And when she had prevailed nothing thereby, she came again to me under the plea of instruction, that she might learn the word of God. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  And she said unto me: If thou willest that I should leave my idols, lie with me, and I will persuade my husband to depart from his idols, and we will walk in the law by thy Lord. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And I said unto her: The Lord willeth not that those who reverence Him should be in uncleanness, nor doth He take pleasure in them that commit adultery, but in those that approach Him with a pure heart and undefiled lips. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  But she heed her peace, longing to accomplish her evil desire. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  And I gave myself yet more to fasting and prayer, that the Lord might deliver me from her. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And again, at another time she said unto me: If thou wilt not commit adultery, I will kill my husband by poison; and take thee to be my husband. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  I therefore, when I heard this, rent my garments, and said unto her: </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  Woman, reverence God, and do not this evil deed, lest thou be destroyed; for know indeed that I will declare this thy device unto all men. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  She therefore, being afraid, besought that I would not declare this device. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  And she departed soothing me with gifts, and sending to me every delight of the sons of men. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  And afterwards she sent me food mingled with enchantments. </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  And when the eunuch who brought it came, I looked up and beheld a terrible man giving me with the dish a sword, and I perceived that her scheme was to beguile me. </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  And when he had gone out I wept, nor did I taste that or any other of her food. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  So then after one day she came to me and observed the food, and said unto me: Why is it that thou hast not eaten of the food? </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  And I said unto her: It is because thou hast filled it with deadly enchantments; and how saidst thou: I come not near to idols but to the Lord alone. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  Now therefore know that the God of my father hath revealed unto me by His angel thy wickedness, and I have kept it to convict thee, if haply thou mayst see and repent. </p>
<p id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup>  But that thou mayst learn that the wickedness of the ungodly hath no power over them that worship God with chastity behold I will take of it and eat before thee. </p>
<p id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup>  And having so said, I prayed thus: The God of my fathers and the angel of Abraham, be with me; and ate. </p>
<p id="v57,"><sup><small>57,</small></sup>  And when she saw this she fell upon her face at my feet, weeping; and I raised her up and admonished her. </p>
<p id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup>  And she promised to do this iniquity no more. </p>
<p id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup>  But her heart was still set upon evil, and she looked around how to ensnare me, and sighing deeply she became downcast, though she was not sick. </p>
<p id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup>  And when her husband saw her, he said unto her: Why is thy countenance fallen? </p>
<p id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup>  And she said unto him: I have a pain at my heart, and the groanings of my spirit oppress me; and so he comforted her who was not sick. </p>
<p id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup>  Then, accordingly seizing an opportunity, she rushed unto me while her husband was yet without, and said unto me: I will hang myself, or cast myself over a cliff, if thou wilt not lie with me. </p>
<p id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup>  And when I saw the spirit of Beliar was troubling her, I prayed unto the Lord, and said unto her: </p>
<p id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup>  Why, wretched woman, art thou troubled and disturbed, blinded through sins? </p>
<p id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup>  Remember that if thou kill thyself, Asteho, the concubine of thy husband, thy rival, will beat thy children, and thou wilt destroy thy memorial from off the earth. </p>
<p id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup>  And she said unto me: Lo, then thou lovest me; let this suffice me: only strive for my life and my children, and I expect that I shall enjoy my desire also. </p>
<p id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup>  But she knew not that because of my lord I spake thus, and not because of her. </p>
<p id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup>  For if a man hath fallen before the passion of a wicked desire and become enslaved by it, even as she, whatever good thing he may hear with regard to that passion, he receiveth it with a view to his wicked desire. </p>
<p id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup>  I declare, therefore, unto you, my children, that it was about the sixth hour when she departed from me; and I knelt before the Lord all day, and all the night; and about dawn I rose up, weeping the while and praying for a release from her. </p>
<p id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup>  At last, then, she laid hold of my garments, forcibly dragging me to have connexion with her. </p>
<p id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup>  When, therefore, I saw that in her madness she was holding fast to my garment, I left it behind, and fled away naked. </p>
<p id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup>  And holding fast to the garment she falsely accused me, and when her husband came he cast me into prison in his house; and on the morrow he scourged me and sent me into Pharaoh's prison. </p>
<p id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup>  And when I was in bonds, the Egyptian woman was oppressed with grief, and she came and heard how I gave thanks unto the Lord and sang praises in the abode of darkness, and with glad voice rejoiced, glorifying my God that I was delivered from the lustful desire of the Egyptian woman. </p>
<p id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup>  And often hath she sent unto me saying: Consent to fulfil my desire, and I will release thee from thy bonds, and I will free thee from the darkness. </p>
<p id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup>  And not even in thought did I incline unto her. </p>
<p id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup>  For God loveth him who in a den of wickedness combines fasting with chastity, rather than the man who in kings' chambers combines luxury with license. </p>
<p id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup>  And if a man liveth in chastity, and desireth also glory, and the Most High knoweth that it is expedient for him, He bestoweth this also upon me. </p>
<p id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup>  How often, though she were sick, did she come down to me at unlooked for times, and listened to my voice as I prayed! </p>
<p id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup>  And when I heard her groanings I held my peace. </p>
<p id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup>  For when I was in her house she was wont to bare her arms, and breasts, and legs, that I might lie with her; for she was very beautiful, splendidly adorned in order to beguile me. </p>
<p id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup>  And the Lord guarded me from her devices. </p>
