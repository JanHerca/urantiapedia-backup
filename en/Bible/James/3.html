<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Be not many [of you] teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now if we put the horses' bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire! </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] a restless evil, [it is] full of deadly poison. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt water yield sweet. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  This wisdom is not [a wisdom] that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace. </p>
