<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  [It is of] Jehovah's lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For the Lord will not cast off for ever. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good? </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned. </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven. </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause. </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off. </p>
<p id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup>  I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon. </p>
<p id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup>  Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. </p>
<p id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup>  Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not. </p>
<p id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup>  O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. </p>
<p id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup>  O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause. </p>
<p id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup>  Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. </p>
<p id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup>  Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me, </p>
<p id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup>  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. </p>
<p id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup>  Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. </p>
<p id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup>  Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands. </p>
<p id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup>  Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them. </p>
<p id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup>  Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah. </p>
