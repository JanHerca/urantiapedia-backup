<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, [And] forsake us so long time? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us. </p>
