<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary! </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint. </p>
