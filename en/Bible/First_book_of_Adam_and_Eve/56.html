<p> <i>A chapter of divine comfort.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him:— </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and behold the angels who are in the garden-that is full of them, and see thyself alone on this earth, with Satan whom thou didst obey.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “Yet, if thou hadst submitted, and been obedient to Me, and hadst kept My Word, thou wouldst be with My angels in My garden.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “But when thou didst transgress and hearken to Satan, thou didst become his guest among his angels, that are full of wickedness; and thou camest to this earth, that brings forth to thee thorns and thistles.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “O Adam, ask him who deceived thee, to give thee the divine nature he promised thee, or to make thee a garden as I had made for thee; or to fill thee with that same bright nature with which I had filled thee.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “Ask him to make thee a body like the one I made thee, or to give thee a day of rest as I gave thee; or to create within thee a reasonable soul, as I did create for thee; or to remove thee hence to some other earth than this one which I gave thee. But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of the things he told thee.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “Acknowledge, then, My favour towards thee, and My mercy on thee, My creature; that I have not requited thee for thy transgression against Me, but in My pity for thee I have promised thee that at the end of the great five days and a half I will come and save thee.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then God said again to Adam and Eve, “Arise, go down hence, lest the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroy you.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and he worshipped before Him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with joy, instead of the fear that had come upon them. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they brought them to the cave. There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them, and then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had sent them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But, after the angels were gone from Adam and Eve, came Satan, with shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were Adam and Eve. He then called to Adam, and said, “O Adam, come, let me speak to thee.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God's angels that was come to give him some good counsel. </p>
