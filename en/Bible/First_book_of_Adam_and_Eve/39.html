<p> <i>Adam is cautious—but too late.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, “Arise, and take a fig for thyself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time was about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to eat of the fruit. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Adam said to Eve, “I am afraid to eat of this fig. I know not what may come upon me from it.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So Adam wept, and stood praying before God, saying, “Satisfy my hunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it, what will it profit me? And what shall I desire and ask of Thee, O God, when it is gone?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And he said again, “I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what will befall me through it.” </p>
