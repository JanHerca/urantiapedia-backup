<p> <i>A vivid prophecy of the life and death of Christ.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  TEN the merciful God, good 'and lover of men, looked upon Adam and Eve, and upon their blood, which they had held up as an offering unto Him; without an order from Him for so doing. But He wondered at them; and accepted their offerings. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their offering. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He smelt the sweet savour of their offering, and showed them mercy. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, “O Adam, as thou hast shed thy blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh of thy seed; and as thou didst die, O Adam, so also will I die. And as thou didst build an altar, so also will I make for thee an altar on the earth; and as thou didst offer thy blood upon it, so also will I offer My blood upon an altar on the earth.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “And as thou didst sue for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I make My blood forgiveness of sins, and blot out transgressions in it.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “And now, behold, I have accepted thy offering, O Adam, but the days of the covenant, wherein I have bound thee, are not fulfilled. When they are fulfilled, then will I bring thee back into the garden.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “Now, therefore, strengthen thy heart; and when sorrow comes upon thee, make Me an offering, and I will be favourable to thee.” </p>
