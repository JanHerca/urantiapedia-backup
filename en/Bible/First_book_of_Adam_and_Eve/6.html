<p> <i>God's admonition to Adam and Eve in which he points out how and why they sinned.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BUT God looked upon them; for they had killed themselves through great grief. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But He would raise them and comfort them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He, therefore, sent His Word unto them; that they should stand and be raised forthwith. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the Lord said unto Adam and Eve, “You transgressed of your own free will, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for divinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made you come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law, and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree, near which I told you not to come! And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “But the wicked Satan who continued not in his first estate, nor kept his faith; in whom was no good intent towards Me, and who though I had created him, yet set Me at naught, and sought the Godhead, so that I hurled him down from heaven,—he it is who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by hearkening to him.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore have I brought upon you all these sorrows.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not intend to destroy them. But after they had sorely roused My anger, I punished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their transgression, they shall be under a curse for ever.” </p>
