<p> <i>A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15). The fall of night.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures where they dwelt. But when they neared it and saw it from afar, heavy sorrow fell upon Adam and Eve when they looked at it. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Adam said to Eve, “When we were on the mountain we were comforted by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that came from the east, shone over us.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shone over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come upon us.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, wherein darkness covers us, so that we are parted from each other; and thou canst not see me, neither can I see thee.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When Adam had said these words, they wept and spread their hands before God; for they were full of sorrow. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they entreated God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so that darkness return not upon them, and they come not again under this covering of rock. And they wished to die rather than see the darkness. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then God looked upon Adam and Eve and upon their great sorrow, and upon all they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the misery that came upon them in a strange land. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Therefore God was not wroth with them; nor impatient with them; but He was longsuffering and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He had created. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, “Adam, as for the sun, if I were to take it and bring it to thee, days, hours, years and months would all come to naught, and the covenant I have made with thee, would never be fulfilled.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “But thou shouldest then be turned and left in a long plague, and no salvation would be left to thee for ever.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “Yea, rather, bear long and calm thy soul while thou abidest night and day; until the fulfilment of the days, and the time of My covenant is come.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  “Then shall I come and save thee, O Adam, for I do not wish that thou be afflicted.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  “And when I look at all the good things in which thou didst live, and why thou camest out of them, then would I willingly show thee mercy.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  “But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth; else would I have brought thee back into the garden.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  “When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show thee and thy seed mercy, and bring thee into a land of gladness, where there is neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness, and light that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden that shall never pass away.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And God said again unto Adam, “Be long-suffering and enter the cave, for the darkness, of which thou wast afraid, shall only be twelve hours long; and when ended, light shall arise.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped before Him, and their hearts were comforted. They returned into the cave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave their body. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Adam and Eve stood praying, until the darkness of night came upon them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And they remained standing in prayer. </p>
