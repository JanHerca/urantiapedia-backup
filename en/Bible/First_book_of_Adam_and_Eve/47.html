<p> <i>The Devil's own Scheming.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that had scorched their bodies. So Adam said to Eve:— </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “Lo, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be when we are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls? Is not our deliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in mercy to us fulfil His promise?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing themselves for coming into it once more. For it was in their thoughts, that they never should enter it, when they saw the fire around it. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing Adam and Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it. After the sun had set, they went out of it. This was the forty-seventh day after they came out of the garden. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep, as they were wont. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then fell asleep under the summit of the mountain. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: Whereas God has promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would deliver him out of all the hardships that have befallen him-but has not promised me by covenant, and will not deliver me out of my hardships; nay, since He has promised him that He should make him and his seed dwell in the kingdom in which I once was—I will kill Adam. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that when he is dead he may not have any seed left to inherit the kingdom that shall remain my own realm; God will then be in want of me, and He will restore me to it with my hosts. </p>
