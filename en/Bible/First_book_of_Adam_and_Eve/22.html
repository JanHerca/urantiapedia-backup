<p> <i>Adam in a chivalrous mood.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam said to God, “I wither in the heat; I am faint from walking, and am loth of this world. And I know not when Thou wilt bring me out of it, to rest.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then the Lord God said unto him, “O Adam, it cannot be at present, not until thou hast ended thy days. Then shall I bring thee out of this wretched land.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Adam said to God, “While I was in the garden I knew neither heat, nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now since I came to this land, all this affliction has come upon me.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then God said to Adam, “So long as thou wast keeping My commandment, My light and My grace rested on thee. But when thou didst transgress My commandment, sorrow and misery befell thee in this land.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Adam wept and said, “O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither smite me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; For we, of our own will, did transgress Thy commandment, and forsook Thy law, and sought to become gods like unto Thee, when Satan the enemy deceived us.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then God said again unto Adam, “Because thou hast borne fear and trembling in this land, languor and suffering treading and walking about, going upon this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this upon Myself in order to save thee.” </p>
