<p> <i>The earliest prophecy of the coming of Christ.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam said unto God: “O Lord, take Thou my soul, and let me not see this gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no darkness.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But God the Lord said to Adam, “Verily I say unto thee, this darkness will pass from thee, every day I have determined for thee, until the fulfilment of My covenant; when I will save thee and bring thee back again into the garden, into the abode of light thou longest for, wherein is no darkness. I will bring thee, to it—in the kingdom of heaven.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Again said God unto Adam, “All this misery that thou hast been made to take upon thee because of thy transgression, will not free thee from the hand of Satan, and will not save thee.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “But I will. When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become flesh of thy seed, and take upon Me the infirmity from which thou sufferest, then the darkness that came upon thee in this cave shall come upon Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of thy seed.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one of the sons of men, in order to save thee.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And God ceased to commune with Adam. </p>
