<p> <i>The fall of Adam. Why night and day were created.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN when God, who is merciful and full of pity, heard Adam's voice, He said unto him:— </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “O Adam, so long as the good angel was obedient to Me, a bright light rested on him and on his hosts.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived him of that bright nature, and he became dark.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he knew naught of darkness.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “But he transgressed, and I made him fall from heaven upon the earth; and it was this darkness that came upon him.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “And on thee, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient to Me, did that bright light rest also.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “But when I heard of thy transgression, I deprived thee of that bright light. Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn thee into darkness, but I made thee thy body of flesh, over which I spread this skin, in order that it may bear cold and heat.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  “If I had let My wrath fall heavily upon thee, I should have destroyed thee; and had I turned thee into darkness, it would have been as if I killed thee.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  “But in My mercy, I have made thee as thou art; when thou didst transgress My commandment, O Adam, I drove thee from the garden, and made thee come forth into this land; and commanded thee to dwell in this cave; and darkness came upon thee, as it did upon him who transgressed My commandment.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “Thus, O Adam, has this night deceived thee. It is not to last for ever; but is only of twelve hours; when it is over, daylight will return.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  “Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in thy heart that this darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say not in thy heart that I plague thee with it.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  “Strengthen thy heart, and be not afraid. This darkness is not a punishment. But, O Adam, I have made the day, and have placed the sun in it to give light; in order that thou and thy children should do your work.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  “For I knew thou shouldest sin and transgress, and come out into this land. Yet would I not force thee, nor be heard upon thee, nor shut up; nor doom thee through thy fall; nor through thy coming out from light into darkness; nor yet through thy coining from the garden into this land.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  “For I made thee of the light; and I willed to bring out children of light from thee and like unto thee.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  “But thou didst not keep one day My commandment; until I had finished the creation and blessed everything in it.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  “Then I commanded thee concerning the tree, that thou eat not thereof. Yet I knew that Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive thee.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  “So I made known to thee by means of the tree, not to come near him. And I told thee not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor yet to sit under it, nor to yield to it.” </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  “Had I not been and spoken to thee, O Adam, concerning the tree, and had I left thee without a commandment, and thou hadst sinned—it would have been an offence on My part, for not having given thee any order; thou wouldst turn round and blame Me for it.” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  “But I commanded thee, and warned thee, and thou didst fall. So that My creatures cannot blame me; but the blame rests on them alone.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  “And, O Adam, I have made the day for thee and for thy children after thee, for them to work, and toil therein. And I have made the night for them to rest in it from their work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by night and seek their food.” </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  “But little of darkness now remains, O Adam; and daylight will soon appear.” </p>
