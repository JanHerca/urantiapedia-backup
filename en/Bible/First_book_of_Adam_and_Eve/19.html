<p> <i>Beasts made subject to Adam.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BUT Adam and Eve wept before God. And Adam said unto Him:— </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to Thee, my Lord, that the beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from the earth.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then Adam, by reason of what had befallen him, smote upon his breast, and fell upon the earth like a corpse; then came to him the Word of God, who raised him, and said unto him, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt thee; because when I made the beasts and other moving things come to thee in the cave, I did not let the serpent come with them, lest it should rise against you, make you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into your hearts.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “For I knew that that accursed one is wicked; therefore would I not let it come near you with the other beasts.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “But now strengthen thy heart and fear not. I am with thee unto the end of the days I have determined on thee.” </p>
