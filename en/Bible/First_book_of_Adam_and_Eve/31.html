<p> <i>They make themselves more comfortable in the Cave of Treasures on the third day.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AFTER these things God said unto Adam, “Thou didst ask of Me something from the garden, to be comforted therewith, and I have given thee these three tokens as a consolation to thee; that thou trust in Me and in My covenant with thee.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  “For I will come and save thee; and kings shall bring me when in the flesh, gold, incense and myrrh; gold as a token of My kingdom; incense as a token of My divinity; and myrrh as a token of My suffering and of My death.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “But, O Adam, put these by thee in the cave; the gold that it may shed light over thee by night; the incense, that thou smell its sweet savour; and the myrrh, to comfort thee in thy sorrow.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When Adam heard these words from God, he worshipped before Him. He and Eve worshipped Him and gave Him thanks, because He had dealt mercifully with them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, each to bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam. And they did so, one by one. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam and Eve, and bring them down from the top of the high mountain, and to take them to the Cave of Treasures. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There they laid the gold on the south side of the cave, the incense on the eastern side, and the myrrh on the western side. For the mouth of the cave was on the north side. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The angels then comforted Adam and Eve, and departed. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The gold was seventy rods; the incense, twelve pounds; and the myrrh, three pounds. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  These remained by Adam in the House of Treasures; therefore was it called “of concealment.” But other interpreters say it was called the “Cave of Treasures,” by reason of the bodies of righteous men that were in it. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  These three things did God give to Adam, on the third day after he had come out of the garden, in token of the three days the Lord should remain in the heart of the earth. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And these three things, as they continued with Adam in the cave, gave him light by night; and by day they gave him a little relief from his sorrow. </p>
