<p> <i>The betrothal of Adam and Eve.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN God looked upon the words of Adam that they were true, and that he could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came unto Adam and said to him, “O Adam, if only thou hadst had this caution at first, ere thou earnest out of the garden into this land!” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel who had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam, that they should inform him respecting his wedding Eve. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then those angels said to Adam, “Take the gold and give it to Eve as a wedding gift, and betroth her; then give her some incense and myrrh as a present; and be ye, thou and she, one flesh.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Adam hearkened to the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's bosom in her garment; and bethrothed her with his hand. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve, to arise and pray forty days and forty nights; and after that, that Adam should come in to his wife; for then this would be an act pure and undefiled; and he should have children who would multiply, and replenish the face of the earth. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the angels departed from them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Adam and Eve began to fast and to pray, until the end of the forty days; and then they came together, as the angels had told them. And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were two hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen days. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated. </p>
