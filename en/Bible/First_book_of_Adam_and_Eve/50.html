<p> <i>Adam and Eve seek to cover their nakedness.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam and Eve went forth and came into the Cave of Treasures, and they stood praying in it the whole of that day, until the evening. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And this took place at the end of fifty days after they had left the garden. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But Adam and Eve rose again and prayed to God in the cave the whole of that night, and begged for mercy from Him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And when the day dawned, Adam said unto Eve, “Come! let us go and do some work for our bodies.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So they went out of the cave, and came to the northern border of the garden, and they sought something to cover their bodies withal. But they found nothing, and knew not how to do the work. Yet their bodies were stained, and they were speechless from cold and heat. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Adam stood and asked God to show him something wherewith to cover their bodies. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then came the Word of God and said unto him, “O Adam, take Eve and come to the seashore, where ye fasted before. There ye shall find skins of sheep, whose flesh was devoured by lions, and whose skins were left. Take them and make raiment for yourselves, and clothe yourselves withal.” </p>
