<p> <i>How destruction and trouble is of Satan when he is the master. Adam and Eve establish the custom of worship.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN God looked upon Adam and Eve, and upon what had come upon them from Satan, and how he had made them perish. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their state of death. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, “O God, Thou hast burnt and taken from us the corn Thou hadst given us, and Thou hast emptied out the bucket of water. And Thou hast sent Thy angels, who have waylaid us from the corn-field. Wilt Thou make us perish? If this be from Thee, O God, then take away our souls; but punish us not.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then God said to Adam, “I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not pour the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead thee astray.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  “But it is Satan, thy master who did it; he to whom thou hast subjected thyself; My commandment being meanwhile set aside. He it is, who burnt down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led thee astray; and all the promises he has made you, verily are but feint, and deceit, and a lie.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “But now, O Adam, thou shalt acknowledge My good deeds done to thee.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to the field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of water. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at God's power. And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when they were hungry. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And God adjured Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy the field of corn. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and took it and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had offered up their first offering of blood. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they offered this oblation again on the altar they had built at first. And they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying, “Thus, O God, when we were in the garden, did our praises go up to Thee, like this offering; and our innocence went up to thee like incense. But now, O God, accept this offering from us, and turn us not back, reft of Thy mercy.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then God said to Adam and Eve, “Since ye have made this oblation and have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down upon earth to save you; and I shall cause it to be offered continually upon an altar, for forgiveness and for mercy, unto those who partake of it duly.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And God sent a bright fire upon the offering of Adam and Eve, and filled it with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came down upon that oblation. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then God commanded an angel to take fire-tongs, like a spoon, and with it to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve. And the angel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were filled with joy and gladness and with the praises of God. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And God said to Adam, “This shall be unto you a custom, to do so, when affliction and sorrow come upon you. But your deliverance and your entrance into the garden, shall not be until the days are fulfilled, as agreed between you and Me; were it not so, I would, of My mercy and pity for you, bring you back to My garden and to My favour for the sake of the offering you have just made to My name.” </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve worshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to the Cave of Treasures. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the eightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then went out of the cave. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering they had made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, “Let us do this three times every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the preparation day Friday, and on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our life.” </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was pleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each taken with the other. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, “O Adam, thou hast determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come upon Me, when I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the preparation day Friday.” </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  “But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised the heavens. And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I create joy, and raise them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer this oblation, all the days of thy life.” </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Then God withdrew His Word from Adam. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  But Adam continued to offer this oblation thus, every week three times, until, the end of seven weeks. And on the first day, which is the fiftieth, Adam made an offering as he was wont, and he and Eve took it and came to the altar before God, as He had taught them. </p>
