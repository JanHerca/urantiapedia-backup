<p> <i>Thirteenth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, to make war against him, through his marriage with Eve.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AFTER this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form n angel, and with him two others, so that they looked like the three angels who had brought to Adam gold, incense, and myrrh. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under the tree, and greeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were full of guile. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But when Adam and Eve saw their comely mien, and heard their sweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought them to Eve, and they remained all together; Adam's heart the while, being glad because he thought concerning them, that they were the same angels, who had brought him gold, incense, and myrrh. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there came upon him from them, peace and joy, through their bringing him good tokens; so Adam thought that they were come a second time to give him other tokens for him to rejoice withal. For he did not know it was Satan; therefore did he receive them with joy and companied with them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, “Rejoice, O Adam, and be glad. Lo, God has sent us to thee to tell thee something.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Adam said, “What is it?” Then Satan answered, “It is a light thing, yet it is a word of God, wilt thou hear it from us and do it? But if thou hearest not, we will return to God, and tell Him that thou wouldest not receive His word.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Satan said again to Adam, “Fear not, neither let a trembling come upon thee; dost not thou know us?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  But Adam said, “I know you not.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then Satan said to him, “I am the angel who brought thee gold, and took it to the cave; this other one is he who brought thee incense; and that third one, is he who brought thee myrrh when thou wast on the top of the mountain, and who carried thee to the cave.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  “But as to the other angels our fellows, who bare you to the cave, God has not sent them with us this time; for He said to us, ‘You suffice.’” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So when Adam heard these words he believed them, and said to these angels, “Speak the word of God, that I may receive it.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Satan said unto him “Swear, and promise me that thou wilt receive it.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Then Adam said, “I know not how to swear and promise.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Satan said to him, “Hold out thy hand, and put it inside my hand.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then Adam held out his hand, and put it into Satan's hand; when Satan said unto him, “Say, now—so true as God is living, rational, and speaking, who raised the heavens in the space, and established the earth upon the waters, and has created me out of the four elements, and out of the dust of the earth—I will not break my promise, nor renounce my word.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Adam swore thus. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Then Satan said to him, “Lo, it is now some time since thou camest out of the garden, and thou knowest neither wickedness nor evil. But now God s says to thee, to take Eve who came out of thy side, and to wed her, that she bear thee children, to comfort thee, and to drive from thee trouble and sorrow; now this thing is not difficult, neither is there any scandal in it to thee.” </p>
