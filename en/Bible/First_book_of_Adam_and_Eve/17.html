<p> <i>The Chapter of the Serpent.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEN Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and went towards the garden. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  But as they drew near to it, before the western gate, from which Satan came when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the. serpent that became Satan coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and wriggling on its breast on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell upon it from God. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And whereas aforetime the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts, now it was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all, and it crept on its breast and went on its belly. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed, and was become the ugliest of them all. Instead of feeding on the best food, now it turned to eat the dust. Instead of dwelling, as before, in the best places, now it lived in the dust. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of which stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And, again, whereas it dwelt in one beautiful abode, to which all other animals came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also of the same; now, after it had become venomous, by reason of God's curse, all beasts fled from its abode, and would not drink of the water it drank; but fled from it. </p>
