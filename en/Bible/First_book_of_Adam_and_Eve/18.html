<p> <i>The mortal combat with the serpent.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head, stood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, did as if it would kill them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by, wept because he had no stick in his hand wherewith to smite the serpent, and knew not how to put it to death. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and held it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said unto him:— </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  “O Adam, because of thee and of Eve, I am slippery, and go upon my belly.” Then by reason of its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and pressed upon them, as if it would kill them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and raised them up. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said unto it, “In the first instance I made thee glib, and made thee to go upon thy belly; but I did not deprive thee of speech.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  “Now, however, be thou dumb; and speak no more, thou and thy race; because in the first place, has the ruin of my creatures happened through thee, and now thou wishest to kill them.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then the serpent was struck dumb, and spake no more. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And a wind came to blow from heaven by command of God that carried away the serpent from Adam and Eve, threw it on the sea shore, and it landed in India. </p>
