<p> <i>Adam does his first day's work.</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve prayed in the cave, and Adam said unto Eve, “Lo, we asked for food of God, and He gave it. But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of water.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then they arose, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that was on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown themselves. And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He would command them to drink of the water. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him, “O Adam, thy body is become brutish, and requires water to drink. Take ye, and drink, thou and Eve; give thanks and praise.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Adam and Eve then drew near, and drank of it, until their bodies felt refreshed. After having drunk, they praised God, and then returned to their cave, after their former custom. This happened at the end of eighty-three days. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took two figs and hung them in the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and a blessing from God. And they placed them there until there should arise a posterity to them, who should see the wonderful things God had done to them. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and besought God to show them some food wherewith to nourish their bodies. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then the Word of God came and said unto him, “O Adam, go down to the westward of the cave, as far as a land of dark soil, and there thou shalt find food.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Adam hearkened unto the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of dark soil, and found there wheat growing, in the ear and ripe, and figs to eat; and Adam rejoiced over it. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said unto him, “Take of this wheat and make thee bread of it, to nourish thy body withal.” And God gave Adam's heart wisdom, to work out the corn until it became bread. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary. He then returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is done with wheat, until it is made into bread for one's use. </p>
