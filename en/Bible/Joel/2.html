<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off [their course]. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God? </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God? </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  but I will remove far off from you the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month]. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
