<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Michael went into the house of Abraham on that evening, and found them preparing the supper, and they ate and drank and were merry. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Abraham said to his son Isaac, “Arise, my son, and spread the man's couch that he may sleep, and set the lamp upon the stand.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Isaac did as his father commanded him, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and Isaac said to his father, “I too am coming to sleep beside you.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abraham answered him, “Nay, my son, lest we be troublesome to this man, but go to your own chamber and sleep.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Isaac not wishing to disobey his father's command, went away and slept in his own chamber. </p>
