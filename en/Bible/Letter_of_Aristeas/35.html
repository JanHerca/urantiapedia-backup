<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Death, “Show us your corruption.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Death made manifest his corruption; and he had two heads, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  the one had the face of a serpent and by it some die at once by asps, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and the other head was like a sword; by it some die by the sword as by bows. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In that day the servants of Abraham died through fear of Death, and Abraham seeing them prayed to the Lord, and he raised them up. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But God returned and removed the soul of Abraham as in a dream, and the archangel Michael took it up into the heavens. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Isaac buried his father beside his mother Sarah, glorifying and praising God, for to him is due glory, honor and worship, of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, now and always and to all eternity. Amen. </p>
