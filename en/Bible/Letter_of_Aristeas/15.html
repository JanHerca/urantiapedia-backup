<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the voice of the Lord said also to the chief-captain Michael, Michael, my servant, turn back Abraham to his house, for behold his end has come near, and the measure of his life is fulfilled, that he may set all things in order, and then take him and bring him to me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So the chief-captain, turning the chariot and the cloud, brought Abraham to his house, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and going into his chamber he sat upon his couch. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Sarah his wife came and embraced the feet of the Incorporeal, and spoke humbly, saying, “I give you thanks, my Lord, that you have brought my Lord Abraham, for behold we thought he had been taken up from us.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And his son Isaac also came and fell upon his neck, and in the same way all his men-slaves and women-slaves surrounded Abraham and embraced him, glorifying God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the Incorporeal one said to them, “Hearken, righteous Abraham. Behold your wife Sarah, behold also your beloved son Isaac, behold also all your men-servants and maid-servants round about you.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Make disposition of all that you have, for the day has come near in which you shall depart from the body and go to the Lord once for all. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Abraham said, “Has the Lord said it, or do you say this of yourself?” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The chief-captain answered, “Hearken, righteous Abraham. The Lord has commanded, and I tell it you.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Abraham said, “I will not go with you.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The chief-captain, hearing these words, straightway went forth from the presence of Abraham, and went up into the heavens, and stood before God the Most High, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and said, “Lord Almighty, behold I have hearkened to Your friend Abraham in all he has said to You, and have fulfilled his requests. I have shown to him Your power, and all the earth and sea that is under heaven. I have shown to him judgment and recompense by means of cloud and chariots, and again he says, I will not go with you.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the Most High said to the angel, “Does my friend Abraham say thus again, I will not go with you? ” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The archangel said, “Lord Almighty, he says thus, and I refrain from laying hands on him, because from the beginning he is Your friend, and has done all things pleasing in Your sight.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  There is no man like him on earth, not even Job the wondrous man, and therefore I refrain from laying hands on him. Command, therefore, Immortal King, what shall be done. </p>
