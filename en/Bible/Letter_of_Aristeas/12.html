<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  While he was yet saying these things to me, behold two angels, fiery in aspect, and pitiless in mind, and severe in look, and they drove on thousands of souls, pitilessly lashing them with fiery thongs. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The angel laid hold of one soul, and they drove all the souls in at the broad gate to destruction. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So we also went along with the angels, and came within that broad gate, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and between the two gates stood a throne terrible of aspect, of terrible crystal, gleaming as fire, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and upon it sat a wondrous man bright as the sun, like to the Son of God. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Before him stood a table like crystal, all of gold and fine linen, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and upon the table there was lying a book, the thickness of it six cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and on the right and left of it stood two angels holding paper and ink and pen. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Before the table sat an angel of light, holding in his hand a balance, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and on his left sat an angel all fiery, pitiless, and severe, holding in his hand a trumpet, having within it all-consuming fire with which to try the sinners. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The wondrous man who sat upon the throne himself judged and sentenced the souls, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and the two angels on the right and on the left wrote down, the one on the right the righteousness and the one on the left the wickedness. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The one before the table, who held the balance, weighed the souls, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  and the fiery angel, who held the fire, tried the souls. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And Abraham asked the chief-captain Michael, “What is this that we behold?” And the chief-captain said, “These things that you see, holy Abraham, are the judgment and recompense. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And behold the angel holding the soul in his hand, and he brought it before the judge, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and the judge said to one of the angels that served him, Open me this book, and find me the sins of this soul. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And opening the book he found its sins and its righteousness equally balanced, and he neither gave it to the tormentors, nor to those that were saved, but set it in the midst.” </p>
