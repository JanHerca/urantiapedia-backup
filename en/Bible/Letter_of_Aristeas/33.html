<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Michael, “Lord, who is this judge, and who is the other, who convicts the sins?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Michael said to Abraham, “Do you see the judge? This is Abel, who first testified, and God brought him hither to judge, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he that bears witness here is the teacher of heaven and earth, and the scribe of righteousness, Enoch, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  for the Lord sent them hither to write down the sins and righteousnesses of each one.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abraham said, “And how can Enoch bear the weight of the souls, not having seen death? Or how can he give sentence to all the souls?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Michael said, “If he gives sentence concerning the souls, it is not permitted; but Enoch himself does not give sentence, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but it is the Lord who does so, and he has no more to do than only to write. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For Enoch prayed to the Lord saying, I desire not, Lord, to give sentence on the souls, lest I be grievous to anyone; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and the Lord said to Enoch, I shall command you to write down the sins of the soul that makes atonement and it shall enter into life, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and if the soul make not atonement and repent, you shall find its sins written down and it shall be cast into punishment.” And about the ninth hour Michael brought Abraham back to his house. But Sarah his wife, not seeing what had become of Abraham, was consumed with grief, and gave up the ghost, and after the return of Abraham he found her dead, and buried her. </p>
