<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And arising they went on, and as they drew near to the city, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  about three furlongs from it, they found a great tree having three hundred branches, like to a tamarisk tree. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they heard a voice from its branches singing, Holy are you, because you have kept the purpose for which you were sent. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Abraham heard the voice, and hid the mystery in his heart, saying within himself, What is the mystery that I have heard? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As he came into the house, Abraham said to his servants, Arise, go out to the flocks, and bring three sheep, and slay them quickly, and make them ready that we may eat and drink, for this day is a feast for us. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And the servants brought the sheep, and Abraham called his son Isaac, and said to him, My son Isaac, arise and put water in the vessel that we may wash the feet of this stranger. And he brought it as he was commanded, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and Abraham said, I perceive, and so it shall be, that in this basin I shall never again wash the feet of any man coming to us as a guest. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Isaac hearing his father say this wept, and said to him, My father what is this that you say? This is my last time to wash the feet of a stranger? And Abraham seeing his son weeping, also wept exceedingly, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and Michael seeing them weeping, wept also, and the tears of Michael fell upon the vessel and became a precious stone. </p>
