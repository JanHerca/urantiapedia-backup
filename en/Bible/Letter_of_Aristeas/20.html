<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Abraham said, “I beseech you, is there also an unexpected death? Tell me.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Death said, “Verily, verily, I tell you in the truth of God that there are seventy-two deaths. One is the just death, buying its fixed time, and many men in one hour enter into death being given over to the grave. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Behold, I have told you all that you have asked, now I tell you, most righteous Abraham, to dismiss all counsel, and cease from asking anything once for all, and come, go with me, as the God and judge of all has commanded me.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Abraham said to Death, “Depart from me yet a little, that I may rest on my couch, for I am very faint at heart, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for since I have seen you with my eyes my strength has failed me, all the limbs of my flesh seem to me a weight as of lead, and my spirit is distressed exceedingly. Depart for a little; for I have said I cannot bear to see your shape.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then Isaac his son came and fell upon his breast weeping, and his wife Sarah came and embraced his feet, lamenting bitterly. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  There came also his men slaves and women slaves and surrounded his couch, lamenting greatly. And Abraham came into indifference of death, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and Death said to Abraham, “Come, take my right hand, and may cheerfulness and life and strength come to you.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For Death deceived Abraham, and he took his right hand, and straightway his soul adhered to the hand of Death. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And immediately the archangel Michael came with a multitude of angels and took up his precious soul in his hands in a divinely woven linen cloth, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and they tended the body of the just Abraham with divine ointments and perfumes until the third day after his death, and buried him in the land of promise, the oak of Mamre, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  but the angels received his precious soul, and ascended into heaven, singing the hymn of thrice holy to the Lord the God of all, and they set it there to worship the God and Father. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And after great praise and glory had been given to the Lord, and Abraham bowed down to worship, there came the undefiled voice of the God and Father saying thus, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Take therefore my friend Abraham into Paradise, where are the tabernacles of my righteous ones, and the abodes of my saints Isaac and Jacob in his bosom, where there is no trouble, nor grief, nor sighing, but peace and rejoicing and life unending. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  (And let us, too, my beloved brethren, imitate the hospitality of the patriarch Abraham, and attain to his virtuous way of life, that we may be thought worthy of the life eternal, glorifying the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; to whom be glory and power forever. Amen.). </p>
