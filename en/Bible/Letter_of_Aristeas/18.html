<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the all-holy Abraham, seeing these things thus, said to Death, “I beseech you, all-destroying Death, hide your fierceness, and put on your beauty and the shape which you had before.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And straightway Death hid his fierceness, and put on his beauty which he had before. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Death, “Why have you done this, that you have slain all my servants and maidservants? Has God sent you hither for this end this day?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Death said, “Nay, my Lord Abraham, it is not as you say, but on your account was I sent hither.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abraham said to Death, “How then have these died? Has the Lord not spoken it?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Death said, “Believe, most righteous Abraham, that this also is wonderful, that you also were not taken away with them. Nevertheless I tell you the truth, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  for if the right hand of God had not been with you at that time, you also would have had to depart from this life.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The righteous Abraham said, “Now I know that I have come into indifference of death, so that my spirit fails, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but I beseech you, all-destroying Death, since my servants have died before their time, come let us pray to the Lord our God that he may hear us and raise up those who died by your fierceness before their time.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Death said, “Amen, be it so.” Therefore Abraham arose and fell upon the face of the ground in prayer, and Death together with him, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the Lord sent a spirit of life upon those that were dead and they were made alive again. Then the righteous Abraham gave glory to God. </p>
