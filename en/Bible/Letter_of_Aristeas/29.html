<p> <i>Version of Chapter 10 in Version 1</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after Abraham had seen the place of judgment, the cloud took him down upon the firmament below, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and Abraham, looking down upon the earth, saw a man committing adultery with a wedded woman. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Abraham turning said to Michael, “Do you see this wickedness? But, Lord, send fire from heaven to consume them.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And straightway there came down fire and consumed them, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for the Lord had said to Michael, do whatever Abraham shall ask you to do for him. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Abraham looked again, and saw other men railing at their companions, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and said, “Let the earth open and swallow them,” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and as he spoke the earth swallowed them alive. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Again the cloud led him to another place, and Abraham saw some going into a desert place to commit murder, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and he said to Michael, “Do you see this wickedness? But let wild beasts come out of the desert, and tear them in pieces,” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and that same hour wild beasts came out of the desert, and devoured them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Then the Lord God spoke to Michael saying, “Turn away Abraham to his own house, and let him not go round all the creation that I have made, because he has no compassion on sinners, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  but I have compassion on sinners that they may turn and live, and repent of their sins and be saved.” </p>
