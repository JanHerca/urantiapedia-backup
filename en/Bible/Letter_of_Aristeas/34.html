<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But when the day of the death of Abraham drew near, the Lord God said to Michael, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Death will not dare to go near to take away the soul of my servant, because he is my friend, but go and adorn Death with great beauty, and send him thus to Abraham, that he may see him with his eyes. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Michael straightway, as he was commanded, adorned Death with great beauty, and sent him thus to Abraham that he might see him. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And he sat down near to Abraham, and Abraham seeing Death sitting near to him was afraid with a great fear. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Death said to Abraham, “Hail, holy soul! Hail, friend of the Lord God! Hail, consolation and entertainment of travelers!” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Abraham said, “You are welcome, servant of the Most High. God. I beseech you, tell me who you are; and entering into my house partake of food and drink, and depart from me, for since I have seen you sitting near to me my soul has been troubled. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For I am not at all worthy to come near you, for you are an exalted spirit and I am flesh and blood, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and therefore I cannot bear your glory, for I see that your beauty is not of this world.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Death said to Abraham, “I tell you, in all the creation that God has made, there has not been found one like you, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  for even the Lord himself by searching has not found such an one upon the whole earth.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Death, “How dare you lie? For I see that your beauty is not of this world.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Death said to Abraham, “Think not, Abraham, that this beauty is mine, or that I come thus to every man. Nay, but if any one is righteous like you, I thus take crowns and come to him, but if it is a sinner I come in great corruption, and out of their sin I make a crown for my head, and I shake them with great fear, so that they are dismayed.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Abraham therefore said to him, “And whence comes your beauty?” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Death said, “There is none other more full of corruption than I am.” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Abraham said to him, “And are you indeed he that is called Death?” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He answered him and said, “I am the bitter name. I am weeping....” </p>
