<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said, “My Lord chief-captain, who is this most wondrous judge? And who are the angels that write down? And who is the angel like the sun, holding the balance? And who is the fiery angel holding the fire?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The chief-captain said, “Do you see, most holy Abraham, the terrible man sitting upon the throne? This is the son of the first created Adam, who is called Abel, whom the wicked Cain killed, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he sits thus to judge all creation, and examines righteous men and sinners. For God has said, I shall not judge you, but every man born of man shall be judged. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore he has given to him judgment, to judge the world until his great and glorious coming, and then, O righteous Abraham, is the perfect judgment and recompense, eternal and unchangeable, which no one can alter. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For every man has come from the first-created, and therefore they are first judged here by his son, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and at the second coming they shall be judged by the twelve tribes of Israel, every breath and every creature. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But the third time they shall be judged by the Lord God of all, and then, indeed, the end of that judgment is near, and the sentence terrible, and there is none to deliver. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And now by three tribunals the judgment of the world and the recompense is made, and for this reason a matter is not finally confirmed by one or two witnesses, but by three witnesses shall everything be established. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The two angels on the right hand and on the left, these are they that write down the sins and the righteousness, the one on the right hand writes down the righteousness, and the one on the left the sins. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The angel like the sun, holding the balance in his hand, is the archangel, Dokiel the just weigher, and he weighs the righteousnesses and sins with the righteousness of God. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The fiery and pitiless angel, holding the fire in his hand, is the archangel Puruel, who has power over fire, and tries the works of men through fire, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  and if the fire consume the work of any man, the angel of judgment immediately seizes him, and carries him away to the place of sinners, a most bitter place of punishment. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But if the fire approves the work of anyone, and does not seize upon it, that man is justified, and the angel of righteousness takes him and carries him up to be saved in the lot of the just. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And thus, most righteous Abraham, all things in all men are tried by fire and the balance.” </p>
