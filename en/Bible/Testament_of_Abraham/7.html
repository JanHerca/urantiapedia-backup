<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham left Sarah, and went into the chamber, and said to Isaac, “Come hither, my beloved son, tell me the truth, what it was you saw and what befell you that you came so hastily to us.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Isaac answering began to say, “I saw, my Lord, in this night the sun and the moon above my head, surrounding me with its rays and giving me light. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As I gazed at this and rejoiced, I saw the heaven opened, and a man bearing light descend from it, shining more than seven suns. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And this man like the sun came and took away the sun from my head, and went up into the heavens from whence he came, but I was greatly grieved that he took away the sun from me. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  After a little, as I was still sorrowing and sore troubled, I saw this man come forth from heaven a second time, and he took away from me the moon also from off my head, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and I wept greatly and called upon that man of light, and said, Do not, my Lord, take away my glory from me; pity me and hear me, and if you take away the sun from me, then leave the moon to me. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He said, ‘Suffer them to be taken up to the king above, for he wishes them there’. And he took them away from me, but he left the rays upon me.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The chief-captain said, “Hear, O righteous Abraham; the sun which your son saw is you his father, and the moon likewise is Sarah his mother. The man bearing light who descended from heaven, this is the one sent from God who is to take your righteous soul from you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And now know, O most honored Abraham, that at this time you shall leave this worldly life, and remove to God.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Abraham said to the chief captain “O strangest of marvels! And now are you he that shall take my soul from me?” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The chief-captain said to him, “I am the chief-captain Michael, that stands before the Lord, and I was sent to you to remind you of your death, and then I shall depart to him as I was commanded.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Abraham said, “Now I know that you are an angel of the Lord, and wast sent to take my soul, but I will not go with you; but do whatever you are commanded.” </p>
