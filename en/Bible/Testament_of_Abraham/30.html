<p> <i>Version of Chapter 11 in Version 1</i> </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham looked and saw two gates, the one small and the other large, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and between the two gates sat a man upon a throne of great glory, and a multitude of angels round about him, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and he was weeping, and again laughing, but his weeping exceeded his laughter seven-fold. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Michael, “Who is this that sits between the two gates in great glory; sometimes he laughs, and sometimes he weeps, and his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Michael said to Abraham, “Do you not know who it is?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And he said, “No, Lord.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Michael said to Abraham, “Do you see these two gates, the small and the great? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  These are they which lead to life and to destruction. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  This man that sits between them is Adam, the first man whom the Lord created, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and set him in this place to see every soul that departs from the body, seeing that all are from him. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When, therefore, you see him weeping, know that he has seen many souls being led to destruction, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  but when you see him laughing, he has seen many souls being led into life. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Do you see how his weeping exceeds his laughter? Since he sees the greater part of the world being led away through the broad gate to destruction, therefore his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold.” </p>
