<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the archangel Michael went down and took Abraham upon a chariot of the cherubim, and exalted him into the air of heaven, and led him upon the cloud together with sixty angels, and Abraham ascended upon the chariot over all the earth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Abraham saw the world as it was in that day, some ploughing, others driving wagons, in one place men herding flocks, and in another watching them by night, and dancing and playing and harping, in another place men striving and contending at law, elsewhere men weeping and having the dead in remembrance. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He saw also the newly-wedded received with honor, and in a word he saw all things that are done in the world, both good and bad. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Abraham therefore passing over them saw men bearing swords, wielding in their hands sharpened swords, and Abraham asked the chief-captain, “Who are these?” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The chief-captain said, “These are thieves, who intend to commit murder, and to steal and burn and destroy.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Abraham said, “Lord, Lord, hear my voice, and command that wild beasts may come out of the wood and devour them.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And even as he spoke there came wild beasts out of the wood and devoured them. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And he saw in another place a man with a woman committing fornication with each other, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and said, “Lord, Lord, command that the earth may open and swallow them, and straightway the earth was cleft and swallowed them.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And he saw in another place men digging through a house, and carrying away other men's possessions, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and he said, “Lord, Lord, command that fire may come down from heaven and consume them. And even as he spoke, fire came down from heaven and consumed them.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And straightway there came a voice from heaven to the chief-captain, saying thus, “O chief-captain Michael, command the chariot to stop, and turn Abraham away that he may not see all the earth, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for if he behold all that live in wickedness, he will destroy all creation. For behold, Abraham has not sinned, and has no pity on sinners, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  but I have made the world, and desire not to destroy any one of them, but wait for the death of the sinner, till he be converted and live. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But take Abraham up to the first gate of heaven, that he may see there the judgments and recompenses, and repent of the souls of the sinners that he has destroyed.” </p>
