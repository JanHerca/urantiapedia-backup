<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then the Most High said, “Call me hither Death that is called the shameless countenance and the pitiless look.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And Michael the Incorporeal went and said to Death, “Come hither; the Lord of creation, the immortal king, calls you.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Death, hearing this, shivered and trembled, being possessed with great terror, and coming with great fear it stood before the invisible father, shivering, groaning and trembling, awaiting the command of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore the invisible God said to Death, “Come hither, you bitter and fierce name of the world, hide your fierceness, cover your corruption, and cast away your bitterness from you, and put on your beauty and all your glory, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and go down to Abraham my friend, and take him and bring him to me. But now also I tell you not to terrify him, but bring him with fair speech, for he is my own friend.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Having heard this, Death went out from the presence of the Most High, and put on a robe of great brightness, and made his appearance like the sun, and became fair and beautiful above the sons of men, assuming the form of an archangel, having his cheeks flaming with fire, and he departed to Abraham. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now the righteous Abraham went out of his chamber, and sat under the trees of Mamre, holding his chin in his hand, and awaiting the coming of the archangel Michael. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And behold, a smell of sweet odor came to him, and a flashing of light, and Abraham turned and saw Death coming towards him in great glory and beauty. And Abraham arose and went to meet him, thinking that it was the chief-captain of God, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and Death beholding him saluted him, saying, Rejoice, precious Abraham, righteous soul, true friend of the Most High God, and companion of the holy angels. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Abraham said to Death, “Hail you of appearance and form like the sun, most glorious helper, bringer of light, wondrous man, from whence does your glory come to us, and who are you, and whence do you come?” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Then Death said, “Most righteous Abraham, behold I tell you the truth. I am the bitter lot of death.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Abraham said to him, “Nay, but you are the comeliness of the world, you are the glory and beauty of angels and men, you are fairer in form than every other, and do you say, I am the bitter lot of death, and not rather, I am fairer than every good thing.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Death said, “I tell you the truth. What the Lord has named me, that also I tell you.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Abraham said, “For what are you come hither?” </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Death said, “For your holy soul am I come.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then Abraham said, “I know what you mean, but I will not go with you; and Death was silent and answered him not a word.” </p>
