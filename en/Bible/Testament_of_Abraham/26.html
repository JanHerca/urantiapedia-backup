<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And it happened about the seventh hour of the night Isaac awoke, and came to the door of his father's chamber, crying out and saying, “Open, father, that I may touch you before they take you away from me.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Abraham arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his father's neck weeping, and kissed him with lamentations. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Abraham wept together with his son, and Michael saw them weeping and wept likewise. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Sarah hearing them weeping called from her bed-chamber, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  saying, “My Lord Abraham, why is this weeping? Has the stranger told you of your brother's son Lot that he is dead? Or has anything else befallen us?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Michael answered and said to Sarah, “Nay, Sarah, I have brought no tidings of Lot, but I knew of all your kindness of heart, that therein you excel all men upon earth, and the Lord has remembered you.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Then Sarah said to Abraham, “How dare you weep when the man of God has come in to you, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and why have your eyes shed tears for today there is great rejoicing? Abraham said to her, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  How do you know that this is a man of God?” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Sarah answered and said, “Because I say and declare that this is one of the three men who were entertained by us at the oak of Mamre, when one of the servants went and brought a kid and you killed it, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and said to me, Arise, make ready that we may eat with these men in our house.” </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Abraham answered and said, “You have perceived well, O woman, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for I too, when I washed his feet knew in my heart that these were the feet which I had washed at the oak of Mamre, and when I began to enquire concerning his journey, he said to me, I go to preserve Lot your brother from the men of Sodom, and then I knew the mystery.” </p>
