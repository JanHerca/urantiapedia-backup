<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Abraham lived the measure of his life, nine hundred and ninety-five years, and having lived all the years of his life in quietness, gentleness, and righteousness, the righteous one was exceeding hospitable; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  for, pitching his tent in the cross-ways at the oak of Mamre, he received every one, both rich and poor, kings and rulers, the maimed and the helpless, friends and strangers, neighbors and travelers, all alike did the devout, all-holy, righteous, and hospitable Abraham entertain. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Even upon him, however, there came the common, inexorable, bitter lot of death, and the uncertain end of life. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Therefore the Lord God, summoning his archangel Michael, said to him: “Go down, chief-captain Michael, to Abraham and speak to him concerning his death, that he may set his affairs in order, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for I have blessed him as the stars of heaven, and as the sand by the sea-shore, and he is in abundance of long life and many possessions, and is becoming exceeding rich. Beyond all men, moreover, he is righteous in every goodness, hospitable and loving to the end of his life; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but go, archangel Michael, to Abraham, my beloved friend, and announce to him his death and assure him thus: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  You shall at this time depart from this vain world, and shall quit the body, and go to your own Lord among the good.” </p>
