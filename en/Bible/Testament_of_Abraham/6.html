<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then Sarah, hearing the excellence of the conversation of the chief-captain, straightway knew that it was an angel of the Lord that spoke. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sarah therefore signified to Abraham to come out towards the door, and said to him, “My Lord Abraham, do you know who this man is?” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Abraham said, “I know not.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Sarah said, “You know, my Lord, the three men from heaven that were entertained by us in our tent beside the oak of Mamre, when you killed the kid without blemish, and set a table before them. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  After the flesh had been eaten, the kid rose again, and sucked its mother with great joy. Do you not know, my Lord Abraham, that by promise they gave to us Isaac as the fruit of the womb? Of these three holy men this is one.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Abraham said, “O Sarah, in this you speak the truth. Glory and praise from our God and the Father. For late in the evening when I washed his feet in the basin I said in my heart, These are the feet of one of the three men that I washed then; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and his tears that fell into the basin then became precious stones. And shaking them out from his lap he gave them to Sarah, saying, If you believe me not, look now at these.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Sarah receiving them bowed down and saluted and said, “Glory be to God that shows us wonderful things. And now know, my Lord Abraham, that there is among us the revelation of some thing, whether it be evil or good!” </p>
