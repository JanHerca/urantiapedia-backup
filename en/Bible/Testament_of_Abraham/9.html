<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the chief-captain receiving the exhortations of the Lord went down to Abraham, and seeing him the righteous one fell upon his face to the ground as one dead, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and the chief-captain told him all that he had heard from the Most High. Then the holy and just Abraham rising with many tears fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and besought him, saying, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  “I beseech you, chief-captain of the hosts above, since you have wholly deigned to come yourself to me a sinner and in all things your unworthy servant, I beseech you even now, O chief-captain, to carry my word yet again to the Most High, and you shall say to him, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thus says Abraham your servant, Lord, Lord, in every work and word which I have asked of you you have heard me, and hast fulfilled all my counsel. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now, Lord, I resist not your power, for I too know that I am not immortal but mortal. Since therefore to your command all things yield, and fear and tremble at the face of your power, I also fear, but I ask one request of you, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and now, Lord and Master, hear my prayer, for while still in this body I desire to see all the inhabited earth, and all the creations which you established by one word, and when I see these, then if I shall depart from life I shall be without sorrow.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So the chief-captain went back again, and stood before God, and told him all, saying, “Thus says your friend Abraham, I desired to behold all the earth in my lifetime before I died.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the Most High hearing this, again commanded the chief-captain Michael, and said to him, “Take a cloud of light, and the angels that have power over the chariots, and go down, take the righteous Abraham upon a chariot of the cherubim, and exalt him into the air of heaven that he may behold all the earth.” </p>
