<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then the chief captain went down to the house of Abraham, and sat down with him at the table, and Isaac served them. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And when the supper was ended, Abraham prayed after his custom, and the chief-captain prayed together with him, and each lay down to sleep upon his couch. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Isaac said to his father, “Father, I too would fain sleep with you in this chamber, that I also may hear your discourse, for I love to hear the excellence of the conversation of this virtuous man.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Abraham said, “Nay, my son, but go to your own chamber and sleep on your own couch, lest we be troublesome to this man.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then Isaac, having received the prayer from them, and having blessed them, went to his own chamber and lay down upon his couch. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  But the Lord cast the thought of death into the heart of Isaac as in a dream, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  and about the third hour of the night Isaac awoke and rose up from his couch, and came running to the chamber where his father was sleeping together with the archangel. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Isaac, therefore, on reaching the door cried out, saying, “My father Abraham, arise and open to me quickly, that I may enter and hang upon your neck, and embrace you before they take you away from me.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Abraham therefore arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his neck, and began to weep with a loud voice. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Abraham therefore being moved at heart, also wept with a loud voice, and the chief-captain, seeing them weeping, wept also. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Sarah being in her room, heard their weeping, and came running to them, and found them embracing and weeping. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Sarah said with weeping, “My Lord Abraham, what is this that you weep? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Tell me, my Lord, has this brother that has been entertained by us this day brought you tidings of Lot, your brother's son, that he is dead? Is it for this that you grieve thus?” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The chief-captain answered and said to her, “Nay, my sister Sarah, it is not as you say, but your son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, and came to us weeping, and we seeing him were moved in our hearts and wept.” </p>
