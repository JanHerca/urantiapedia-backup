<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Isaac his son: “Go, my beloved son, into the inner chamber of the house and beautify it. Spread for us there two couches, one for me and one for this man that is with us this day. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Prepare for us there a seat and a candlestick and a table with abundance of every good thing. Beautify the chamber, my son, and spread under us linen and purple and fine linen. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Burn there every precious and excellent incense, and bring sweet-smelling plants from the garden and fill our house with them. Kindle seven lamps full of oil, so that we may rejoice, for this man that is our this day is more glorious than kings or rulers, and his appearance surpasses all the sons of men.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Isaac prepared all things well, and Abraham taking the archangel Michael went into the chamber, and they both sat down upon the couches, and between them he placed a table with abundance of every good thing. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Then the chief captain arose and went out, as if by constraint of his belly to make issue of water, and ascended to heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before the Lord, and said to him: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  “Lord and Master, let your power know that I am unable to remind that righteous man of his death, for I have not seen upon the earth a man like him, pitiful, hospitable, righteous, truthful, devout, refraining from every evil deed. And now know, Lord, that I cannot remind him of his death.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the Lord said: “Go down, chief-captain Michael, to my friend Abraham, and do whatever he says to you, and eat with him whatever he eats. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I will send my Holy Spirit upon his son Isaac, and will put the remembrance of his death into the heart of Isaac, so that even he in a dream may see the death of his father, and Isaac will relate the dream, and you shall interpret it, and he himself will know his end.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the chief-captain said, “Lord, all the heavenly spirits are incorporeal, and neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before me a table with abundance of all good things earthly and corruptible. Now, Lord, what shall I do? How shall I escape him, sitting at one table with him? ” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The Lord said: “Go down to him, and take no thought for this, for when you sit down with him, I will send upon you a devouring spirit, and it will consume out of your hands and through your mouth all that is on the table. Rejoice together with him in everything, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  only you shall interpret well the things of the vision, that Abraham may know the sickle of death and the uncertain end of life, and may make disposal of all his possessions, for I have blessed him above the sand of the sea and as the stars of heaven.” </p>
