<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said, “And he that cannot enter through the narrow gate, can he not enter into life?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Abraham wept, saying, “Woe is me, what shall I do? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For I am a man broad of body, and how shall I be able to enter by the narrow gate, by which a boy of fifteen years cannot enter?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Michael answered and said to Abraham, “Fear not, father, nor grieve, for you shall enter by it unhindered, and all those who are like you.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And as Abraham stood and marveled, behold an angel of the Lord driving sixty thousand souls of sinners to destruction. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Michael, “Do all these go into destruction?” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Michael said to him, “Yea, but let us go and search among these souls, if there is among them even one righteous.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And when they went, they found an angel holding in his hand one soul of a woman from among these sixty thousand, because he had found her sins weighing equally with all her works, and they were neither in motion nor at rest, but in a state between; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  but the other souls he led away to destruction. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Abraham said to Michael, “Lord, is this the angel that removes the souls from the body or not?” Michael answered and said, “This is death, and he leads them into the place of judgment, that the judge may try them.” </p>
