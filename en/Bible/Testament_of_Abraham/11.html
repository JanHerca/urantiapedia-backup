<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  So Michael turned the chariot and brought Abraham to the east, to the first gate of heaven; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and Abraham saw two ways, the one narrow and contracted, the other broad and spacious, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and there he saw two gates, the one broad on the broad way, and the other narrow on the narrow way. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And outside the two gates there he saw a man sitting upon a gilded throne, and the appearance of that man was terrible, as of the Lord. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they saw many souls driven by angels and led in through the broad gate, and other souls, few in number, that were taken by the angels through the narrow gate. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And when the wonderful one who sat upon the golden throne saw few entering through the narrow gate, and many entering through the broad one, straightway that wonderful one tore the hairs of his head and the sides of his beard, and threw himself on the ground from his throne, weeping and lamenting. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But when he saw many souls entering through the narrow gate, then he arose from the ground and sat upon his throne in great joy, rejoicing and exulting. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Abraham asked the chief-captain, “My Lord chief-captain, who is this most marvelous man, adorned with such glory, and sometimes he weeps and laments, and sometimes he rejoices and exults?” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The incorporeal one said: “This is the first-created Adam who is in such glory, and he looks upon the world because all are born from him, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and when he sees many souls going through the narrow gate, then he arises and sits upon his throne rejoicing and exulting in joy, because this narrow gate is that of the just, that leads to life, and they that enter through it go into Paradise. For this, then, the first-created Adam rejoices, because he sees the souls being saved. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But when he sees many souls entering through the broad gate, then he pulls out the hairs of his head, and casts himself on the ground weeping and lamenting bitterly, for the broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to destruction and eternal punishment. And for this the first-formed Adam falls from his throne weeping and lamenting for the destruction of sinners, for they are many that are lost, and they are few that are saved, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  for in seven thousand there is scarcely found one soul saved, being righteous and undefiled.” </p>
