<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Michael went and came to Abraham, and found him sitting before his oxen for ploughing, and he was exceeding old in appearance, and had his son in his arms. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Abraham, therefore, seeing the archangel Michael, rose from the ground and saluted him, not knowing who he was, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and said to him: “The Lord preserve you. May your journey be prosperous with you.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Michael answered him: “You are kind, good father.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abraham answered and said to him: “Come, draw near to me, brother, and sit down a little while, that I may order a beast to be brought that we may go to my house, and you may rest with me, for it is toward evening, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and in the morning arise and go wherever you will, lest some evil beast meet you and do you hurt.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Michael enquired of Abraham, saying: “Tell me your name, before I enter your house, lest I be burdensome to you.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Abraham answered and said, “My parents called me Abram, and the Lord named me Abraham, saying: Arise and depart from your house, and from your kindred, and go into the land which I shall show unto you. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when I went away into the land which the Lord showed me, he said to me: ‘Your name shall no more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham.’” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Michael answered and said to him: “Pardon me, my father, experienced man of God, for I am a stranger, and I have heard of you that you went forty furlongs and brought a goat and slew it, entertaining angels in your house, that they might rest there.” </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thus speaking together, they arose and went towards the house. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Abraham called one of his servants, and said to him: “Go, bring me a beast that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is wearied with his journey.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And Michael said: “Trouble not the youth, but let us go lightly until we reach the house, for I love your company”. </p>
