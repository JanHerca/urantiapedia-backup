<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said, “My Lord, I beseech you to lead me to the place of judgment so that I too may see how they are judged.” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Michael took Abraham upon a cloud, and led him into Paradise, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and when he came to the place where the judge was, the angel came and gave that soul to the judge. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the soul said, “Lord have mercy on me.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And the judge said, “How shall I have mercy upon you, when you had no mercy upon your daughter which you had, the fruit of your womb? Wherefore did you slay her?” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  It answered, “Nay, Lord, slaughter has not been done by me, but my daughter has lied upon me.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  But the judge commanded him to come that wrote down the records, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and behold cherubim carrying two books. And there was with them a man of exceeding great stature, having on his head three crowns, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and the one crown was higher than the other two. These are called the crowns of witness. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And the man had in his hand a golden pen, and the judge said to him, Exhibit the sin of this soul. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And that man, opening one of the books of the cherubim, sought out the sin of the woman's soul and found it. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And the judge said, “O wretched soul, why do you say that you have not done murder? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Did you not, after the death of your husband, go and commit adultery with your daughter's husband, and kill her?” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he convicted her also of her other sins, whatsoever she had done from her youth. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Hearing these things the woman cried out, saying, “Woe is me, all the sins that I did in the world I forgot, but here they were not forgotten.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then they took her away also and gave her over to the tormentors. </p>
