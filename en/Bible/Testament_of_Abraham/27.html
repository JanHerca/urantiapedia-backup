<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said to Michael, “Tell me, man of God, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  and show to me why you have come hither.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Michael said, “Your son Isaac will show you.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Abraham said to his son, “My beloved son, tell me what you have seen in your dream today, and wast frightened. Relate it to me.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Isaac answered his father, “I saw in my dream the sun and the moon, and there was a crown upon my head, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and there came from heaven a man of great size, and shining as the light that is called the father of light. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He took the sun from my head, and yet left the rays behind with me. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And I wept and said, I beseech you, my Lord, take not away the glory of my head, and the light of my house, and all my glory. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the sun and the moon and the stars lamented, saying, Take not away the glory of our power. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And that shining man answered and said to me, Weep not that I take the light of your house, for it is taken up from troubles into rest, from a low estate to a high one; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  they lift him up from a narrow to a wide place; they raise him from darkness to light. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And I said to him, I beseech you, Lord, take also the rays with it. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He said to me, There are twelve hours of the day, and then I shall take all the rays. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  As the shining man said this, I saw the sun of my house ascending into heaven, but that crown I saw no more, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and that sun was like you my father.” </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Michael said to Abraham, “Your son Isaac has spoken truth, for you shall go, and be taken up into the heavens, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  but your body shall remain on earth, until seven thousand ages are fulfilled, for then all flesh shall arise. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Now therefore, Abraham, set your house in order, and your children, for you have heard fully what is decreed concerning you.” </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Abraham answered and said to Michael, “I beseech you, Lord, if I shall depart from my body, I have desired to be taken up in my body that I may see the creatures that the Lord my God has created in heaven and on earth.” </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Michael answered and said, “This is not for me to do, but I shall go and tell the Lord of this, and if I am commanded I shall show you all these things.” </p>
