<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And as they went on from the field toward his house, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  beside that way there stood a cypress tree, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  and by the command of the Lord the tree cried out with a human voice, saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God that calls himself to those that love him;” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  but Abraham hid the mystery, thinking that the chief-captain had not heard the voice of the tree. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And coming near to the house they sat down in the court, and Isaac seeing the face of the angel said to Sarah his mother, “My lady mother, behold, the man sitting with my father Abraham is not a son of the race of those that dwell on the earth.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Isaac ran, and saluted him, and fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and the Incorporeal blessed him and said, “The Lord God will grant you his promise that he made to your father Abraham and to his seed, and will also grant you the precious prayer of your father and your mother.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Abraham said to Isaac his son, “My son Isaac, draw water from the well, and bring it me in the vessel, that we may wash the feet of this stranger, for he is tired, having come to us from off a long journey.” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And Isaac ran to the well and drew water in the vessel and brought it to them, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  and Abraham went up and washed the feet of the chief captain Michael, and the heart of Abraham was moved, and he wept over the stranger. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Isaac, seeing his father weeping, wept also, and the chief captain, seeing them weeping, also wept with them, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and the tears of the chief captain fell upon the vessel into the water of the basin and became precious stones. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Abraham seeing the marvel, and being astonished, took the stones secretly, and hid the mystery, keeping it by himself in his heart. </p>
