<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  When Sarah, being inside in her house, heard their weeping, she came out and said to Abraham, “Lord, why is it that you thus weep?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Abraham answered, and said to her, “It is no evil. Go into your house, and do your own work, lest we be troublesome to the man.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And Sarah went away, being about to prepare the supper. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the sun came near to setting, and Michael went out of the house, and was taken up into the heavens to worship before God, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  for at sunset all the angels worship God and Michael himself is the first of the angels. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And they all worshipped him, and went each to his own place, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  but Michael spoke before the Lord and said, Lord, command me to be questioned before your holy glory! </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the Lord said to Michael, “Announce whatsoever you will!” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And the Archangel answered and said, “Lord, you sent me to Abraham to say to him, Depart from your body, and leave this world; the Lord calls you; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and I dare not, Lord, reveal myself to him, for he is your friend, and a righteous man, and one that receives strangers. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  But I beseech you, Lord, command the remembrance of the death of Abraham to enter into his own heart, and bid not me tell it him, </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  for it is great abruptness to say, Leave the world, and especially to leave one's own body, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  for you created him from the beginning to have pity on the souls of all men.” </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Then the Lord said to Michael, “Arise and go to Abraham, and lodge with him, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and whatever you see him eat, eat also, and wherever he shall sleep, sleep there also. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For I will cast the thought of the death of Abraham into the heart of Isaac his son in a dream.” </p>
