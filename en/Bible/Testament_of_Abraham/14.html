<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And Abraham said to the chief-captain, “My Lord the chief-captain, the soul which the angel held in his hand, why was it adjudged to be set in the midst?” </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The chief-captain said, “Listen, righteous Abraham. Because the judge found its sins and its righteousnesses equal, he neither committed it to judgment nor to be saved, until the judge of all shall come.” </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Abraham said to the chief-captain, “And what yet is wanting for the soul to be saved?” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The chief-captain said, “If it obtains one righteousness above its sins, it enters into salvation.” </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abraham said to the chief-captain, “Come hither, chief-captain Michael, let us make prayer for this soul, and see whether God will hear us. The chief-captain said, Amen, be it so; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and they made prayer and entreaty for the soul, and God heard them, and when they rose up from their prayer they did not see the soul standing there.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Abraham said to the angel, “Where is the soul that you held in the midst?” </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And the angel answered, “It has been saved by your righteous prayer, and behold an angel of light has taken it and carried it up into Paradise.” </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Abraham said, “I glorify the name of God, the Most High, and his immeasurable mercy.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Abraham said to the chief-captain, “I beseech you, archangel, hearken to my prayer, and let us yet call upon the Lord, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and supplicate his compassion, and entreat his mercy for the souls of the sinners whom I formerly, in my anger, cursed and destroyed, whom the earth devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces, and the fire consumed through my words. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now I know that I have sinned before the Lord our God. Come then, O Michael, chief-captain of the hosts above, come, let us call upon God with tears that he may forgive me my sin, and grant them to me.” </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And the chief-captain heard him, and they made entreaty before the Lord, and when they had called upon him for a long space, there came a voice from heaven saying, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  “Abraham, Abraham, I have hearkened to your voice and your prayer, and forgive you your sin, and those whom you think that I destroyed I have called up and brought them into life by my exceeding kindness, because for a season I have requited them in judgment, and those whom I destroy living upon earth, I will not requite in death.” </p>
