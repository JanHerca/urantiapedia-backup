<p>Eventuation is the process by which transcendental beings are brought into existence. These “<a href="/topic/eventuators">eventuators</a>” are neither finite nor infinite—they are absonite; and absonity is neither infinity nor absoluteness. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> These eventuated beings include the following orders: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Architects of the Master Universe. </li>
<li>Transcendental Recorders. </li>
<li>Other Transcendentalers. </li>
<li>Primary Eventuated Master Force Organizers. </li>
<li>Associate Transcendental Master Force Organizers. </li>
</ol>
<p>These Transcendentalers create no beings, neither were they ever created. In speaking of their origin, in order to avoid using a new term—an arbitrary and meaningless designation—we deem it best to say that Transcendentalers simply eventuate. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On Paradise there is a tradition that far back in <a href="/topic/eternity">eternity</a> there was attempted the eventuation of the 28,012th Master Architect, but that this being failed to absonitize, experiencing personality seizure by the Universal Absolute. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
