<p>The better Epicureans were not given to sensual excesses. At least this doctrine helped to deliver the Romans from a more deadly form of fatalism; it taught that men could do something to improve their terrestrial status. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Unbelieving materialists and fatalists can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and soul comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and to endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Primitive religion prevented fatalism; they believed they could at least do something to influence fate. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Jesus’ teaching to trust in the overcare of the heavenly Father was not a blind and passive fatalism. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
