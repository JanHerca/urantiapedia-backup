<p><a href="/topic/Amos_(John_Mark’s_friend)">Amos</a> was the seventh brother of Jesus. He was born on the night of Sunday, January 9, A.D. 7, and he died on the afternoon of Saturday, December 3, AD 12, after a week sick with a high fever. This death was even more painful for the family because father Joseph had recently passed away. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Jesus got along especially well with his little siblings, <a href="/topic/Amos_(John_Mark’s_friend)">Amos</a> and Ruth. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
