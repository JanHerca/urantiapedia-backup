<p>Jesus talked trying to show the twelve what they must be, not what they must do. They knew only a religion that imposed the doing of certain things as the means of attaining righteousness—salvation. But Jesus would reiterate, “In the kingdom you must be righteous in order to do the work”. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
