<p>Shortsighted and time-bound mortal minds should be slow to criticize the time delays of the farseeing and all-wise administrators of universe affairs. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On Paradise, <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a> is never regarded as <a href="/topic/defeat">defeat</a>; postponement is never looked upon as disgrace; the apparent <a href="/topic/defeat">failures</a> of time are never confused with the significant delays of eternity. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The mansonia life early teaches the young morontia pupils that postponement is in no sense avoidance. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Wisdom of delay </h2>
<p>Between reasons for delay are: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<ol>
<li>Mercy requires that every wrongdoer have sufficient time in which to formulate a deliberate and fully chosen attitude. </li>
<li>Supreme justice is dominated by a Father’s love. </li>
<li>No affectionate father is ever precipitate in visiting punishment. </li>
<li>Wisdom and love admonish the upright children to bear with an erring brother. </li>
<li>It is required an unqualified sovereignty to exercise summary jurisdiction. </li>
<li>The Ancients of Days seldom execute wrongdoers without a full hearing. </li>
<li>It is better to stay away from the rebels and allow the rebellion to take its natural course of self-destruction. </li>
<li>It is better to allow the rebels free course to the end that all sympathy for these evildoers should be the sooner uprooted in the heart. </li>
<li>It is needed to foster full opportunity for every living creature to mature a deliberate choice in any matter. </li>
<li>Full <a href="/topic/disclosure">disclosure</a> and unlimited opportunity for sin-expression is the quickest technique of achieving the perfect and final cure of the plague of evil and sin. </li>
<li>At least three times the number of beings are led astray if arbitrary or summary methods of suppression are attempted. </li>
<li>Time, even in a universe of time, is relative. Sometimes time is shorter than we think. </li>
