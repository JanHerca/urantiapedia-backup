<p>Jesus recommended his <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a> to avoid loss of time through overmuch social visiting and other trivialities which might detract from wholehearted <a href="/topic/devotion">devotion</a> to preaching the gospel. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Confusion, being puzzled, even sometimes <a href="/topic/discouragement">discouraged</a> and distracted, does not necessarily signify resistance to the leadings of the indwelling Adjuster. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>We all have lives to live in accordance with the will of God, and at all times when we seek to escape the present <a href="/topic/duty">duty</a> of living by running away to far-off enticements, we thereby put ourselves in the immediate control of those influences which are not directed by the powers of truth and the forces of righteousness. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus </h2>
<p>In all his teaching Jesus unfailingly avoided distracting <a href="/topic/details">details</a>. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>He refused to have his attention diverted from his mission of establishing a new way of salvation; he would not permit himself to be concerned about anything else. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In his work as carpenter, though Jesus wasted little time upon trifles, he was a painstaking workman when it came to the essentials of any given undertaking. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
