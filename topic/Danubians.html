<p>The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the <a href="/topic/Danube">Danube</a> valley. They made pottery and tilled the land, preferring to live in the valleys. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Greeks imported Danubians as slaves. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The most northerly settlement of the Danubians was at Liege in Belgium. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> The Danubians became mother worshipers as the result of the work of the missionaries from Crete. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
