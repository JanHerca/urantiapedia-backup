<p>After the submergence of <a href="/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> the Nodites moved north and east, presently founding the new city of Dilmun as their racial and cultural headquarters. Bablot, the builder of the tower of Babel, wanted the monument to be erected in Dilmun, but another site was eventually found. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Egyptians called this city of ancient glory <a href="/topic/Dilmat">Dilmat</a>, while the later Adamized Sumerians confused both the first and second Nodite cities with <a href="/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> and called all three Dilmun. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
