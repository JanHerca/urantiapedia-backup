## Future

From here it would be possible to evaluate new future additions to the project. Some ideas for the future that could be hosted in the *Urantiapedia*:
* Serve as a central place for efforts to translate the book into other languages.
* Serve as a portal to offer online training courses on different topics related to *The Urantia Book*.
