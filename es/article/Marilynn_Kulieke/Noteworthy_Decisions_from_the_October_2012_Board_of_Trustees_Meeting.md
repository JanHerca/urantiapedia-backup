_By Marilynn Kulieke, secretary, Urantia Foundation, Lincolnshire, Illinois, USA_

As always, finances and governance, education initiatives, translations and revisions, the executive director's report, and book sales and distribution were discussed. What follows are some of the noteworthy decisions from the meeting.

## Budget Passed for 2013

For the last three years, the budget has been basically the same, but due to financial needs for translations/revisions, education, and book distribution, the board raised the budget 4% for 2013.

## Public Relations Seminar

The Education Committee and Public Relations Committee are planning a public relations media training seminar in Marzo 2013. Representatives from Urantia Foundation, Urantia Association International, and The Urantia Book Fellowship are working together in this joint effort. The purpose is to become better prepared to respond to media inquiries as _The Urantia Book_ becomes better known.

## Update from the Book Committee

Book sales will likely exceed the board's goal of a 7% increase by the end of 2012. Internet and digital book sales continue to outpace bookstore sales with a double digit increase expected during 2013.

After a two year search for a book distributor in Hungary, Trustee Henk Mylanus and his wife Claire recently signed a contract. Book distribution for Az Urantia könyv began on November the 8th. Our thanks to both for their efforts in expanding the distribution of _The Urantia Book_ in European book markets.

Michael Hanian and Georges Michelson-Dupont are exploring new avenues of book distribution in Russia. Urantia Foundation is currently in the process of receiving printing bids after all the Russian books were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Approximately 20,000 USD needs to be raised for this printing.

## Translations and Revisions

The French, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish revisions are proceeding according to plan and budget. Within a few years, the French and Russian revisions will be completed. Ongoing translations such as the Chinese, Japanese, Czech, and Farsi are works in progress. The Chinese translation is projected for completion in 2017.

Two new translations are underway. The translation of _The Urantia Book_ into Hebrew has commenced, and fundraising efforts for an Indonesian translation have begun. With over 248 million people, Indonesia ranks as the fourth most populated nation in the world. In addition, 90% of the Indonesian citizens are literate. The cost of the Indonesian translation is approximately 40,000 USD.

Special thanks to the Translation Committee, to the revision teams, to the translators, to Rogério Reis da Silva for his translator website, and to Georges Michelson-Dupont, manager of translations, for their excellent work during 2012.

## Education Committee Updates

Thanks to the leadership of Gard Jameson and the Education Committee, Urantia Foundation has developed a curriculum with the two most recent seminars focused on worship and wisdom and on race. In Junio 2013, Dr. Jeffrey Wattles will present a seminar on spiritual perceptions. In August 2013, Ralph Zehr, associate trustee, will facilitate a seminar on cosmic consciousness. "Forgiveness and Understanding" will likely be a seminar in the near future.

Ralph Zehr is also an active teacher/facilitator for the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) and has been researching a new educational software system that works in many languages, offers capabilities beyond current needs, costs less than is currently being spent, and is used widely so that the software remains updated. Ralph plans to make his report about this software at the board's January meeting.

## Renovation of the Third Floor of 533 W Diversey Parkway

The board approved an ad hoc committee consisting of Jay Peregrine, Jennifer Siegel, Gard Jameson, Jay Bird, and Mo Siegel to prepare a plan to finance, renovate, and occupy the third floor of Urantia Foundation. The ad hoc committee will present this plan to the Board no later than Julio 2013.

The renovation is intended to increase Urantia Foundation's capacity to provide classrooms and meeting spaces designed for educational purposes. The facilities would be opened up for use to Urantia Book organizations.
